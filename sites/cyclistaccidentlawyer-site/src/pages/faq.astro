const faqs: Array<{question: string; answer: string}> = [
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to hire a bicycle accident lawyer?",
    answer: "Nothing upfront. Our network attorneys work on contingency, meaning they only get paid if you win your case. The initial consultation is always free."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I wasn't wearing a helmet when I was hit?",
    answer: "You may still recover compensation. Most states don't require adult cyclists to wear helmets. Even in states with helmet laws, not wearing a helmet doesn't excuse the driver's negligence—they still had a duty to safely share the road. Contact us for a free evaluation of your specific situation."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do I have to file a bicycle accident claim?",
    answer: "This varies by state—from 1 year in Kentucky, Louisiana, and Tennessee to 6 years in Maine, Minnesota, and North Dakota. It's crucial to act quickly, as evidence deteriorates and witnesses forget. Contact us immediately to ensure you don't miss your deadline."
  },
  {
    question: "What compensation can I receive for a bicycle accident?",
    answer: "You may be entitled to: medical expenses (past and future), lost wages and loss of earning capacity, pain and suffering, bike repair or replacement, permanent disability compensation, disfigurement damages, and in wrongful death cases, funeral expenses and loss of companionship."
  },
  {
    question: "What if the driver who hit me fled (hit-and-run)?",
    answer: "You may still have options. Your own uninsured motorist coverage (if you have auto insurance) may apply. Police investigation, surveillance footage, and witnesses may help identify the driver. Crime victim compensation funds may also be available. Contact us for a free evaluation."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a bicycle accident case take?",
    answer: "Cases vary widely. Simple cases may settle in a few months, while complex cases requiring litigation can take 1-3 years. Factors include injury severity, disputed liability, insurance company cooperation, and whether trial is necessary."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a lawyer for a bicycle accident?",
    answer: "While not required, having an experienced attorney typically results in significantly higher compensation. Insurance companies have teams of adjusters and lawyers working against you—you deserve someone on your side who understands cyclist rights."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do right after being hit by a car while cycling?",
    answer: "Seek medical attention immediately, call 911, document the scene with photos if able, get witness information, don't admit fault, don't give statements to the driver's insurance, preserve your damaged bike and gear, and contact an attorney before signing anything."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I didn't go to the hospital right away?",
    answer: "See a doctor as soon as possible. Delayed symptoms are common in bicycle accidents due to adrenaline. While gaps in treatment can complicate claims, an experienced attorney can still help. Contact us for a free evaluation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I sue if I was hit while riding in a bike lane?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Cyclists in bike lanes have clear right-of-way, making liability more straightforward. Drivers who enter bike lanes or fail to check before turning are negligent. Your case may be particularly strong."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a 'dooring' accident?",
    answer: "A dooring accident occurs when a parked vehicle's occupant opens their door into the path of an oncoming cyclist. These crashes are extremely dangerous and often cause serious injuries. The person who opened the door is typically liable for failing to check for cyclists."
  },
  {
    question: "Does the 3-foot passing law help my case?",
    answer: "Many states have laws requiring drivers to maintain at least 3 feet of clearance when passing cyclists. If a driver violated this law when hitting you, it can help establish their negligence. Check your state's specific requirements—some require 4 feet or safe distance."
