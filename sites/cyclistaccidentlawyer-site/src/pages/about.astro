            Cyclist Accident Lawyer is a free accident consultation service. We are NOT a law firm.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Every year, over 1,000 cyclists are killed and more than 130,000 are injured in crashes with motor vehicles in the United States. Behind each statistic is a person—a commuter, a recreational rider, a child learning to ride, or an athlete training for their next event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cyclist Accident Lawyer was created to help these victims find justice. We're a consultation service that connects injured cyclists with experienced attorneys who understand bicycle law, fight against insurance company tactics, and work tirelessly to secure fair compensation. We're paid by the law firms in our network — you never pay us anything.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Bicycle Accident Cases Are Different</h2>
        <p>
          Bicycle accident cases require specialized legal knowledge that many personal injury attorneys lack:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cyclist Rights:</strong> Bicycles are vehicles with equal rights to the road, but many drivers and even some attorneys don't understand this.</li>
          <li><strong>Specialized Laws:</strong> Helmet requirements, safe passing laws, and bike lane regulations vary by state and affect case outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Blame-Shifting Tactics:</strong> Insurance companies frequently blame cyclists—even when drivers are clearly at fault.</li>
          <li><strong>Severe Injuries:</strong> Without the protection of a vehicle, cyclists often suffer catastrophic injuries requiring significant compensation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Attorney Network</h2>
