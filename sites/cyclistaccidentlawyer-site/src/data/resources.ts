    category: "Legal",
    description: "Understanding your legal rights and duties as a cyclist on public roads.",
    content: `## Cyclist Rights on the Road

### Equal Road Rights
In all 50 states, bicycles are legally considered vehicles with the same rights as motor vehicles. This means:

- Right to use public roads
- Right to full lane use when necessary
- Right to travel at your own safe speed
- Right to be yielded to when you have right-of-way
- Right to not be harassed or endangered

### When You Can Take the Full Lane

You may generally use the full lane when:
- The lane is too narrow to share safely
- Avoiding road hazards
- Preparing for a left turn
- Passing other vehicles
- Lane is marked for straight-through at intersection where you're going straight

### Protected by Law

Most states have laws specifically protecting cyclists:
- Safe passing distance laws (3+ feet)
- Anti-harassment laws
- Protected bike lane regulations
- Right-of-way protections

## Cyclist Responsibilities

### Follow Traffic Laws
- Obey traffic signals and signs
- Ride in the same direction as traffic
- Use hand signals for turns
- Yield when required

### Ride Predictably
- Maintain a steady line
- Don't weave between cars
- Signal your intentions
- Be consistent

### Use Proper Equipment
- Lights at night (front white, rear red)
- Working brakes
- Helmet (required in some states/ages)

### Exercise Due Care
- Watch for hazards
- Ride at appropriate speeds
- Give pedestrians right-of-way
- Be alert at intersections

## Common Misconceptions

### Myth: Cyclists Must Ride as Far Right as Possible
**Reality:** Laws say "practicable," which includes exceptions for safety, hazards, and lane width.

### Myth: Cyclists Must Use Bike Lanes When Available
**Reality:** Many states allow lane choice. Bike lanes may be unsafe due to debris, doors, or turns.

### Myth: Cyclists Can't Use Roads with Bike Paths Nearby
**Reality:** Cyclists generally have the right to use roads even when paths exist.

### Myth: Cars Always Have Right-of-Way Over Bicycles
**Reality:** Bicycles have equal right-of-way rights. Often, the cyclist has priority.`

    category: "Legal",
    description: "State-by-state overview of safe passing distance requirements for motorists.",
    content: `## Safe Passing Laws Explained

### What Are Safe Passing Laws?

These laws require motorists to maintain a minimum distance when passing cyclists. Most states require at least 3 feet of clearance.

### Why These Laws Matter

- Prevent sideswipe accidents
- Give cyclists buffer space
- Create awareness of cyclist vulnerability
- Establish clear legal standards

## State Requirements

### Three-Foot Minimum States
Most states require at least 3 feet:
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas (varies by speed), Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

### Four-Foot Minimum
- Pennsylvania
- New Hampshire
- Vermont

### Five-Foot Minimum
- New Mexico (strongest in nation)

### Variable Requirements
- Texas: 3 feet under 25 mph, 6 feet over 25 mph
- Colorado: 3 feet under 40 mph, 5 feet over 40 mph

### Only "Safe Distance" Language
Some states lack specific distance requirements but require passing at a "safe distance."

## What Drivers Must Do

1. Wait for safe opportunity to pass
2. Move to adjacent lane when possible
3. Slow down when lane change isn't possible
4. Maintain required distance while passing
5. Not return to lane until safely past cyclist

## If a Driver Passes Too Closely

- Note the vehicle description and plate
- Report to police if safe to do so
- Document time and location
- Close passes are ticketable offenses
- Can be evidence if an accident occurs

## Advocating for Better Laws

If your state lacks strong passing laws:
- Support cycling advocacy organizations
- Contact your legislators
- Share your experiences
- Testify at hearings`

    slug: "common-defense-arguments",
    category: "Legal",
    description: "How drivers and insurers try to avoid liability and how to counter their arguments.",
    content: `## Defense Strategies and How to Counter Them

### "I Didn't See the Cyclist"

**Their Argument:**
The cyclist appeared suddenly or was invisible.

**Counter-Arguments:**
- Drivers have a duty to look carefully
- "Looked but didn't see" is still negligent
- Inattentional blindness doesn't excuse liability
- Cyclists have rights to use the road
- You must see what's there to be seen

### "The Cyclist Was Going Too Fast"

**Their Argument:**
The cyclist's speed caused or contributed to the crash.

**Counter-Arguments:**
- Cyclists can ride at any legal speed
- Drivers must yield regardless of cyclist speed
- Driver's duty exists at all cyclist speeds
- Speed usually not the proximate cause

### "The Cyclist Wasn't Visible Enough"

**Their Argument:**
Dark clothing, no lights, hard to see.

**Counter-Arguments:**
- Daytime visibility requirements are minimal
- Driver's duty to look carefully still exists
- Other traffic saw the cyclist
- Meeting legal visibility requirements is sufficient

### "The Cyclist Wasn't Wearing a Helmet"

**Their Argument:**
Injuries would have been less severe with a helmet.

**Counter-Arguments:**
- Only relevant to head injuries
- Many states limit this evidence
- Doesn't affect who caused the crash
- Adult helmet use is usually optional

### "The Cyclist Was in the Wrong Place"

**Their Argument:**
Not in bike lane, wrong side of road, etc.

**Counter-Arguments:**
- Cyclists have lane choice rights
- Exceptions to "far right" rules exist
- Position may have been proper for conditions
- Driver's duty exists regardless

### "The Cyclist Ran a Red Light/Stop Sign"

**Their Argument:**
Cyclist violated traffic law.

**Counter-Arguments:**
- Idaho Stop may be legal in your state
- Driver may also have violated laws
- Violation must be proximate cause
- Comparative fault doesn't eliminate claim

### "This Road Is Dangerous for Cyclists"

**Their Argument:**
Cyclist assumed the risk by riding there.

**Counter-Arguments:**
- Cyclists have right to use all roads
- Drivers must expect cyclists
- Assumption of risk rarely applies
- Driver still had duties

## Building Your Defense
