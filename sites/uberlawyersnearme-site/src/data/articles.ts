    category: "Uber Accidents",
    content: `Many people wonder whether they can sue Uber directly after an accident. The answer depends on several factors.

## Uber's Insurance Coverage

Uber provides commercial insurance coverage for accidents during rides. Most claims are resolved through this insurance without needing to sue Uber itself.

## When You Might Sue Uber

- Negligent hiring or retention of a dangerous driver
- Inadequate background check failures
- Sexual assault or criminal acts by drivers
- Cases where insurance is insufficient

## Uber's Arbitration Clause

Uber's Terms of Service contain an arbitration clause that may require disputes to go through private arbitration rather than court. However, some exceptions exist.

## Building Your Case

Whether you pursue insurance claims or a lawsuit, you'll need strong evidence of:
- The driver's negligence or misconduct
- Your injuries and damages
- Uber's liability (if pursuing directly)

Consult with an experienced rideshare accident attorney to understand your best options.`,

## Getting Proper Treatment

- Seek immediate medical attention
- Follow up on all symptoms
- Complete recommended treatment

## Can You Recover for Seatbelt Injuries?

Yes. Even though the seatbelt was doing its job, you can still recover for:

The at-fault driver is liable for all injuries caused by the accident.

## What If You Weren't Wearing a Seatbelt?

This varies by state:
- Some states reduce your recovery
- Others don't consider it relevant to fault
- It should not completely bar your claim in most cases

## Documenting Seatbelt Injuries

- Photograph any visible bruising or marks
- Report symptoms to your doctor immediately
- Follow up on internal injury concerns
- Keep all medical records

## Your Coverage as an Uber Driver

### Period 1 (App On, Waiting)
- Contingent liability coverage only
- Your personal insurance applies first
- Gaps may exist

- Your own insurance may provide coverage
- Uber's contingent coverage may apply

## Third-Party Claims

If another driver caused the accident, you can pursue:
- Their auto insurance

- Rideshare activity specifically

This means your personal insurance may deny claims for accidents while driving rideshare.

## Rideshare Endorsements

Many insurance companies now offer:
- Rideshare endorsements
- Gap coverage for Period 1
- Hybrid personal/commercial policies

## What You Should Do

1. Check your current policy for rideshare exclusions
2. Ask about rideshare endorsements
3. Understand Uber/Lyft's coverage and gaps
4. Consider additional coverage options

## The Cost of Not Having Proper Coverage

- Denied claims
- Personal liability
- Vehicle not covered
- Policy cancellation

- Injuries exceed one policy's limits
- Disputes over which period driver was in
- Other driver was also at fault
- Need UM/UIM because at-fault driver was underinsured

    category: "Settlements",
    content: `Insurance companies often make quick settlement offers. Here's how to know if you should accept.

## Red Flags - Don't Accept If:

- You don't know the full extent of your injuries
- You're still receiving medical treatment
- The offer doesn't cover all your expenses
- You haven't consulted an attorney
- The offer came within days of the accident

## How to Evaluate an Offer

### Calculate Your Actual Damages
- All medical bills (past and future)
- All lost wages (past and future)
- Property damage
- Pain and suffering
- Other losses

### Compare to the Offer
Is the offer lower than your documented damages? It almost always is initially.

## Why Quick Settlements Are Bad

- You don't know future medical needs
- Insurance wants to close cheap
- Once signed, you can't ask for more
- Hidden injuries may emerge

## What to Do Instead

1. Get complete medical treatment
2. Document all damages
3. Understand your full losses
4. Consult an attorney
5. Then evaluate any offer

## When Settlement Makes Sense

- Your injuries are fully known and healed
- The offer is fair for your damages
- Trial would be risky or prolonged
- You need money sooner rather than later`,

## Best Practices

### Immediately After Accident

- Don't message anyone about it

### During Your Case
- Set everything to private

- Tell friends not to tag you

## What's Discoverable
