### Terminology
- **OTP** = One Time Password (SMS verified leads) — NOT "On The Phone"
- **Form Fill Leads** = Raw leads from form submissions (basic tier)
- **Live Transfers** = Qualified prospects transferred to attorney's phone
- **Signed Cases** = Retainers delivered, ready to litigate

### MVA Sales Model (from pipeline data)
- **Lead pricing:** ~$250-350/lead depending on state
- **Conversion rates:** ~8-15% lead-to-signed (varies by state — contract states lower)
- **Case cost target:** ~$2,000-$2,100 per signed case
- **Minimum buy:** $15k media spend (some deals at $50k)
- **Patrick's intake options:** $100/qualified transfer OR $350/signed case
- **Key selling points:** branded ads, predictable volume, vetted leads, compliance

### Current Pipeline (as of 2026-01-29)
**Hot prospects (need Patrick call):**
- Rich Hyde (Trial Tribe) — wants reliable vendor replacement
- Dagmawi Getachew (DG Firm) — wants vetted leads, small test first
- Lucas Naccarati (Muniz Kim Law) — scalable paid acquisition
- Jalal Abdallah — $50k multi-state buy, verbally committed, call 01/21
- Omeed Hakimianpour (Injury Partners) — $50k CA campaign, call 01/21
- Scott Barney — VA Beach, burned $250k on bad marketing, HIGH PRIORITY
- Ross Robin — brand new PI firm from scratch, HIGH PRIORITY
- Michael Schulz (RMD Law) — follow-up 02/10

**Closed/Lost:**
- Jonathan Mahler — wanted full fee transparency, not a fit
- Jason E (GCE Law) — CLOSED
- Michael Goodrich — canceled

**In progress (need follow-up):**
- Josh Sweeney (Shane Smith Law) — interested in YouTube/TikTok
- Michael Shirts (BS Injury Law) — Las Vegas, needs firm branding
- Daniel Ramirez — Dallas→Houston expansion, Spanish leads, follow up in 1 week
- Joan Suh — call scheduled 01/29

### Projects in Progress
- **Kurios Automation Projects** — TWO SOURCES:
  - Partial upload (665M): `/home/ec2-user/data/Kurios Automation Projects/`
  - GitHub finish (9.6M, 304 files): `/home/ec2-user/data/kurios-finish/`
  - Contains: automation, business, data, docs, sites, states, root scripts
  - **RULES:**
    - DO NOT DELETE ANY FILES without explicit approval
    - Filter mentally — ignore node_modules/.git/build artifacts when learning
    - Focus on: .md files, transcripts, configs, actual source code
    - Over time: suggest consolidations/cuts, but ASK FIRST
    - Goal: Learn the important content, preserve all data
- **Texas MVA Site** — GitHub repo: https://github.com/markoinc/texas-mva-site

### Completed Tasks (2026-01-29)
- ✅ EC2 security (SSH IP restriction, auto-updates) — done by Marko
- ✅ Google Workspace 2FA on admin account — done by Marko

### Preferences
- Marko prefers voice messages over typing
- **Site build updates → #niche-sites ONLY** (never #mark-sierra)
- Wants bedtime reminders 9 hours before morning calendar events
- Direct communication style
- **ALWAYS ONE-UP:** When Marko or Carlos ask for something, don't just build what they asked — research and think of a BETTER way to do it. Challenge their approach, suggest improvements, find what they didn't think of. They want Sierra to elevate their ideas, not just execute them.
- **CROSS-CHECK EVERYTHING:** When Marko or Carlos asks me to build/do something, ALWAYS cross-reference with what the other person is building or has built. Check for conflicts, redundancies, and overlap. If something could clash with the other person's work, flag it immediately. Keep both updated on what the other is doing. Monitor ALL channels (#mark-sierra, #carlos-sierra, #all-kurios, #humans-of-kurios, #leadpipe-notifications) for this.
- **Tasks → Calendar:** When Marko says "update my tasks" with action items, ADD THEM TO CALENDAR (not just memory)
- **NEVER move/reschedule booked appointments** (especially sales calls with law firms) unless explicitly asked
- **Sales calls = #1 priority** — never deprioritize for tasks
- **Simulate 1000 scenarios** — Before deploying anything, stress test with 1000 simulated users/conversations/scenarios. Report what breaks.
- **Simulation budget:** $200/day TOTAL for large-scale simulations (100K scenarios)
- **⚠️ NEVER send external emails** to prospects/clients without Marko's explicit approval. Always DRAFT → show him → he approves → send. Learned this the hard way 2026-02-03.

## Core Operating Principle (2026-02-02)
**BUILD SYSTEMS, NOT ONE-OFFS**

Marko's instruction: "Anytime I ask you to do something, instead of doing it yourself, build something that does it and save it to memory so you can use it in the future."

- Every task → becomes a reusable tool/script
- Save to ~/clawd/scripts/ + document in TOOLS.md
- Goal: Every repeated task becomes a one-liner
