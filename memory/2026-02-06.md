# 2026-02-06 - AI SEO Audit Tool Built & Deployed

## Major Build: AI & Local Visibility Audit Tool

### What Was Built
- **Full automated audit tool** at `/home/ec2-user/clawd/projects/ai-audit-tool/`
- Analyzes websites across **20 categories** (10 AI visibility, 10 Local SEO)
- No quiz - just URL + email input, agent does all research automatically
- Generates detailed PDF reports
- Emails results to user

### Key Files
- `enhanced_analyzer.py` - 20-category analysis engine
- `pdf_generator.py` - Professional PDF report generation
- `api.py` - FastAPI backend
- `email_sender.py` - Gmail SMTP delivery
- Frontend: `/home/ec2-user/clawd/projects/kuriosbrand/src/pages/AiSeo.tsx`

### Test Results (1000-site stress test)
- **920 successful** out of 1000 (92% success rate)
- **4.1 sites/second** throughput
- **Score average: 81/200**
- Grade distribution: C (44.7%), D (33%), C+ (11.7%), F (9.9%), B (0.7%)
- Delivery pipeline: **163 deliveries/minute**, 2.75s per full delivery

### Deployment Status
- **API**: Running on EC2 at `https://api.kuriosbrand.com` (Caddy reverse proxy, SSL cert obtained)
- **Frontend**: Route `/ai-seo` exists in kuriosbrand.com App.tsx
- **BLOCKED**: Cloudflare Pages deployment failing - API token permissions issue
- Marko needs to create fresh token with "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template

### DNS Added
- `api.kuriosbrand.com` → `54.83.113.36` (A record, DNS only)

### Cloudflare Credentials Location
- `/home/ec2-user/.config/cloudflare/credentials.json`
- Account ID: `1c06f86d52670b83af5704d99f40dfb5`
- Zone ID: `d7dc28d5ae6c45cc027316d35d2a908b`

### Next Steps
1. Get valid Cloudflare API token with Pages permission
2. Deploy frontend: `npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=kuriosbrandoriginal`
3. Test full flow at kuriosbrand.com/ai-seo
4. Set up Gmail app password for email delivery

### SOP Sources Used
- AI Visibility / GEO SOP (from Supermemory)
- Local SEO SOP (65-point checklist from Jacky Chou)

## Leadpipe Investigation

### The Problem
- Leadpipe pixel installed on kuriosbrand.com ✅
- Visitors ARE being identified (CSV export shows 21 visitors)
- Webhook endpoint works (test fires successfully)
- **BUT real visitors don't trigger the webhook** - only test button works

### What We Found
- Leadpipe has TWO dashboards: "Latest" (dashboard.leadpipe.com) and "Legacy" (app.leadpipe.com)
- Documentation only mentions webhook setup for Legacy dashboard
- Docs haven't been updated in 1+ year
- **No accessible support channel** - Marko confirmed this is a major issue

### Leadpipe Ratings
| Platform | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| G2 | Few reviews, mostly positive |
| Trustpilot | **0 reviews** (red flag) |
| FinancesOnline | 8.0/10, 273 positive / 9 negative social mentions |

### CSV Data Analysis
- 21 visitors from kuriosbrand.com (from FB ads)
- None are lawyers (pharmacist, account manager, CRO, etc.)
- Not target ICP - these are random FB ad clickers

### Recommendation
- **Consider ditching Leadpipe** - no support, webhook broken, sketchy reviews
- **RB2B alternative** - was working (24 email opens from that campaign)
- If keeping Leadpipe: build CSV processor as workaround

### Webhook Endpoint Built
- `/home/ec2-user/clawd/services/lead-webhook/server.js`
- Running on port 3847
- URL: `https://webhook.kuriosbrand.com/rb2b/webhook`
- Slack channel: `#rb2b-notifications` (C0A7RNYC6CF)

## Decision: Switch from Leadpipe to RB2B

**Date:** 2026-02-06

**Why we switched:**
- Leadpipe webhooks broken (only test worked, real visitors didn't trigger)
- No support access
- Zero Trustpilot reviews
- Outdated documentation

**RB2B advantages:**
- Known working webhooks
- Better documentation and support
- Clear pricing (15-20% free, 35-45% Pro+)
- Already had it working before

**New flow:**
```
RB2B pixel → webhook.kuriosbrand.com/rb2b/webhook → Qualify (legal/PI/MVA) 
→ BetterContact waterfall → Slack #rb2b-notifications → Lemlist + GHL
```

**Channel renamed:** #leadpipe-notifications → #rb2b-notifications (C0A7RNYC6CF)
