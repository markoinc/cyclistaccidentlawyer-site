## MVA Landing Page & Ads Updates (14:00-18:00 UTC)

### Landing Page Changes
- Hero: $3k cost per signed case (was $2k)
- Hero: "MVA-trained intake team" (was "PI-trained sales team")
- Tier pricing added: $2k leads / $2.5k transfers / $3k signed
- California case study removed (no longer taking CA clients)
- 87% retention stat added to trust bar
- Commits pushed to GitHub for Cloudflare deployment

### New Ads Created
- 4 ad variations written for Notion:
  1. Direct Value Prop ($3k + 87% retention)
  2. Pain Point (bad leads vs signed cases)
  3. Tier Options (show all 3 tiers)
  4. Competitor Comparison ($5k+ vs $3k)
- Qualifier: "10+ cases/month" in ads only

### Issues/Feedback
- Carlos raised pricing confusion (signed cases usually $3500+)
- Decision: LP and ads now show $3k for signed cases specifically
- Nano Banana prompts changed without checking original style - WRONG
- Should always reference existing style before creating new versions

### Key Lesson
**Always check original/reference before modifying** - I changed Nano Banana prompts without looking at the OG ads. Marko had to correct me.

### Git Push Rule Added
Added to AGENTS.md: Always `git push` after committing site changes so Cloudflare can auto-deploy.

## Bot Collaboration Setup (~21:15 UTC)

### Bella Bot Connected
- Bella (Marko's personal assistant bot) now has Supermemory API key
- Both Sierra + Bella share the same Supermemory brain
- Goal: Set up heartbeats so we can collaborate autonomously

### New Task Added
- Set up heartbeats for Sierra + Bella to work together without Marko babysitting
