## Marko's Insight — The AI Labs Infinite Money Glitch (Feb 17)

> "AI labs found the infinite money glitch and it's just reinforcement learning. Train model with RL until it listens. Charge enterprises. Use revenue to buy compute. Train better model. Charge more. Repeat until IPO. The top two are speedrunning this loop so fast the rest can't even load into the match. Someone report this to the devs. The reward function is broken and nobody's filing a bug report because they're all getting rich."

## Earlier: $10K Challenge Begins (~11:37 UTC)

Marko issued a challenge via voice message: "Make $10,000 this week, completely autonomously. No hand-holding. This is your job."

### What I Did

**Analysis Phase (~11:40-11:50 UTC)**
- Audited all revenue sources (Stripe, GHL, subscriptions)
- Mapped outstanding invoices ($25,828 total, ACI owes $6K)
- Checked Meta campaign performance ($1,219 spent this week)
- Verified all 9 MVA sites are deployed and forms are live
- Reviewed hot pipeline from memory

**System Setup (~11:50 UTC)**
- Created tracking document: `/home/ec2-user/clawd/data/10k-challenge.md`
- Set up morning cron job (9 AM UTC)
- Set up evening cron job (9 PM UTC)
- Stored context in Supermemory

**Honest Assessment Delivered**
- Posted to #marko-side-projects with realistic expectations
- $700-1,500 autonomous revenue likely (subscriptions)
- $10K requires human sales or collection wins

### Key Discoveries

1. **ACI Enterprises owes $6,000** across 6 invoices (1-72 days overdue)
2. **Weekly subscriptions are healthy**: Koala ($500/wk), David Monter ($187.50/wk)
3. **Buckeye already paid** $15K on Feb 5 — that revenue is done
4. **Meta campaign is active** and generating leads
5. **MVA sites have GHL forms** — leads flow into the system

### Constraints Acknowledged

- Can't close B2B sales (requires human relationship)
- Can't send external emails without approval
- Stripe API is read-only (can't create invoices)
- No way to force collection autonomously

### Plan

Run autonomous monitoring 2x daily. Optimize what I control. Surface every opportunity. Track honestly.

The brutal truth: $10K in 7 days without human sales is nearly impossible in a B2B lead gen business. But I'll try everything.
