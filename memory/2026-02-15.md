## $10K Challenge Begins (~11:37 UTC)

Marko issued a challenge via voice message: "Make $10,000 this week, completely autonomously. No hand-holding. This is your job."

### What I Did

**Analysis Phase (~11:40-11:50 UTC)**
- Audited all revenue sources (Stripe, GHL, subscriptions)
- Mapped outstanding invoices ($25,828 total, ACI owes $6K)
- Checked Meta campaign performance ($1,219 spent this week)
- Verified all 9 MVA sites are deployed and forms are live
- Reviewed hot pipeline from memory

**System Setup (~11:50 UTC)**
- Created tracking document: `/home/ec2-user/clawd/data/10k-challenge.md`
- Set up morning cron job (9 AM UTC)
- Set up evening cron job (9 PM UTC)
- Stored context in Supermemory

**Honest Assessment Delivered**
- Posted to #marko-side-projects with realistic expectations
- $700-1,500 autonomous revenue likely (subscriptions)
- $10K requires human sales or collection wins

### Key Discoveries

1. **ACI Enterprises owes $6,000** across 6 invoices (1-72 days overdue)
2. **Weekly subscriptions are healthy**: Koala ($500/wk), David Monter ($187.50/wk)
3. **Buckeye already paid** $15K on Feb 5 — that revenue is done
4. **Meta campaign is active** and generating leads
5. **MVA sites have GHL forms** — leads flow into the system

### Constraints Acknowledged

- Can't close B2B sales (requires human relationship)
- Can't send external emails without approval
- Stripe API is read-only (can't create invoices)
- No way to force collection autonomously

### Plan

Run autonomous monitoring 2x daily. Optimize what I control. Surface every opportunity. Track honestly.

The brutal truth: $10K in 7 days without human sales is nearly impossible in a B2B lead gen business. But I'll try everything.
