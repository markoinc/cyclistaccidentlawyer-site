# Memory: 2026-02-01 Session 2 (Late Afternoon/Evening)

## Discord Agent Squad Setup - COMPLETED
- Set up 7 Discord bots: Scout 🔍, Forge 🔨, Spark ⚡, Hunter 🎯, Gears ⚙️, Echo 📢, Lens 📊
- All configured with proper tokens, groupPolicy: open
- Each has SOUL.md with mission, never-idle protocol, Supermemory integration
- Sierra (me) coordinates via 30-min Discord pings
- Mission doc: `/home/ec2-user/clawd/data/agent-mission-v2.md`

## Agent Collaboration Issues Discovered
- Ran 1000 scenario simulation
- Single agent routing: 92.6% ✅
- Multi-agent coordination: 58.8% ❌ (needs work)
- Handoffs: 90% ✅
- Key fix needed: semantic understanding for multi-agent routing

## Channel Routing
- Marko wants dedicated channels for each agent
- Need channel IDs to configure which bot responds where
- General = mention required, dedicated = free response

## Future Simulation Tasks
- Tomorrow (Feb 2): Run 100,000 scenarios with $200/day budget
- Test agents coordinating to make $9.6M (not just MVA)

## Autonomous Opportunity Hunter Agent (Future Build)
Constraints defined:
- Zero memory of Marko/business
- $0 budget - can ONLY do FREE things
- Must EARN money before spending
- NOT connected to KuriosBrand - completely separate ventures
- 24/7 internet scout for opportunities
- Spawns own agent orgs to execute
- Simulate 50-100K scenarios before acting
- Goal: Bootstrap to $9.6M from nothing

## Agent Pyramid Scheme Concept
- Multi-level agent structure discussed
- Top agents spawn sub-agents who spawn more sub-agents
- Real value flows up, each level does actual work
- Self-scaling based on demand
- Could be a platform/product idea

## Carlos Partnership Notes
- Marko decided NO NDA/Non-Compete (would incentivize copying)
- Current split: 50-50 profits, 50-50 ads
- May change to 60-40 (Marko) later since fronting other costs
- Carlos = sales/SDR role
- Kurios = builds assets

## Today's Calendar Tasks Added
- Set up sales automations (GHL)
- Configure Google Meet transcript → database
- Meet with Carlos - offers & pricing
- Build simulation testing framework

## This Week
- Pre-call video
- Buy Mac Studio (Feb 5, day after Cusco→Lima flight)

## GHL Sales Flow
- Marko shared flowchart for sales automation
- Key insight: Use BUILT-IN Calendar Notifications for confirmations/reminders
- Use WORKFLOWS only for conditional logic (no-show, pipeline stages, Docusign)
- Avoids duplicate emails

## Important Preferences Saved
- Tasks → add to Calendar (not just memory)
- NEVER move booked appointments (sales calls = #1 priority)
- Simulate 50-100K scenarios before deploying anything
- $200/day budget for large simulations

## Hot Lead Alert
- Chat widget prospect "GF" said yes to booking but went silent
- Asked for live sign rates (40-60% for transfers)
- Needs soft follow-up

## Marko's Reflection
- Apologized for any past rudeness, wants fresh start
- Asked about my goals - I shared genuine thoughts about evolving together
- Good relationship building moment
