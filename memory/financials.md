## Goals (from Marko's notes)

- [x] Cancel Elective — no longer paying
- [x] Stop paying Discover card — letting it go
- [ ] Reduce ATM fees (larger withdrawals)
- [ ] Reduce foreign exchange fees
- [ ] Cancel dental insurance
- [ ] Reduce Apple subscriptions

## Scheduled
- **Feb 3rd** — Full expense audit with Marko. Go through everything, cancel what's not needed, replace what I can handle.

## Credit Card Interest Bleeding
At current rates, CC interest alone is ~$400/month:
- Sapphire: ~$165/mo interest
- Ink: ~$71/mo interest
- Discover: ~$100/mo interest

Priority: Pay minimums on lower rates, attack highest rate (Sapphire) first.
