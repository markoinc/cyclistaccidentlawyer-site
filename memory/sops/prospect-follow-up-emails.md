**Created:** 2026-02-03
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03

## Purpose
Standard process for drafting follow-up emails to MVA lead gen prospects after sales calls.

---

## Email Structure

### Subject Line
- Clear, benefit-focused
- Example: "Following Up — Two Options for Getting More PI Cases in [State]"

### Body Structure

1. **Opening** — Brief, reference the call
   - "Great speaking with you earlier. I wanted to recap the options we discussed so you have everything in writing."

2. **Options** — Present each option clearly with:
   - Price
   - What they get (# of signed cases)
   - Timeline (30-40 days, NOT 60-90)
   - Guarantee status (if any)

3. **Differentiation Section** — "A Quick Note on Shopping Around"
   - Address that other vendors promise "cases" but deliver leads
   - Emphasize: "Real signed cases cost more, but they're already converted. That's what we deliver."
   - Highlight scalability of paid advertising vs unpredictable referrals

4. **Next Steps** — Include follow-up appointment date/time
   - Check Google Calendar for the scheduled follow-up
   - Format: "Our follow-up call is scheduled for [Day], [Date] at [Time] [Timezone]."
   - Close with: "Looking forward to getting started."

5. **Signature** — Simple (see email-signature.md)

## Key Points to Remember

### Timelines
- Signed cases delivered in **30-40 days** (NOT 60-90)

### Terminology
- We deliver **signed cases** — not leads, not warm transfers
- "Intake team handling qualification and signing the case for you"
- Don't oversell Patrick's credentials unless verified

### What NOT to include
- Don't mention Patrick by name or his background unless specifically instructed
- Don't include phone number or LLC in signature
- Don't say "warm transfers" when describing the signed cases model

### Before Sending
1. Get Mark's approval on draft
2. Verify follow-up date from Google Calendar (mark@kuriosbrand.com)
3. Confirm CC recipients and their emails
