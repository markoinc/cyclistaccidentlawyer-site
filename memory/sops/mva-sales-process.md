We buy wholesale from:

And resell with **guaranteed delivery** at fixed prices.

## 4 Buyer Personas (ICPs)

### 1. Skeptical Veteran
- Deep experience, spent $250k+ wasted on marketing
- Hates black-box media buys
- Wants: transparency, control, guarantees IN WRITING
- **Pitch:** "We're not a black box. Full transparency, strict qualifiers. If something's junk, we make it right."

### 2. Solo Scaler
- Solo or transitioning associate, ~7 years exp
- No intake team, fears high overhead

- **Pitch:** "We handle the chase. Start small to prove ROI, then scale."

### 3. Ops/Marketing Partner
- Non-lawyer handling marketing, data-driven
- Has 15+ vendors, needs new channels + API integration
- Worries about overlap
- **Pitch:** "We feed your engine. Real-time API delivery, isolated channels — no overlap."

### 4. Expansionist
- Young firm aggressively scaling coast-to-coast
- Hates intake grunt work, values time
- **Pitch:** "We build the infrastructure for your empire. You handle litigation, we handle the noise."
