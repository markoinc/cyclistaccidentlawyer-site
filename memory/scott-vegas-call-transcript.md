**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Participants:** Scott (prospect), Patrick (Inquired Esquire), Mark (KuriosBrand/COD referral partner)

## Key Takeaways
- **6 figures spent on failed lead gen** - Law Pro Nation, Louder, Forest Zuckerman, Intake HQ
- **Cost per case:** ~$10K (target: under $2,500-3,000)
- **"Show me state" mentality** - extremely skeptical, needs proof
- **Wants vendor skin in the game** - pay per case model appeals

## Killer Quotes for Messaging

- "I could give a shit about leads - I want CASES"
- "Every company tells me the same thing - you're gonna do it better than everybody else"
- "I'm the only one with skin in the game - I have all the risk"
- "99% of the stuff when I'm talking to someone, it's not even a case"

## Vendors Mentioned (All Failed)

- Louder Media - significant spend, no success
- Forest Zuckerman/LeadDV - $23K since October, 2 cases
