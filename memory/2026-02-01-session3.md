## Dashboard Build - Major Project

### Evolution
1. Started with static HTML dashboard (dashboard-v3.html)
2. Ran multiple simulation tests (100K+, 50K+, 200K total)
3. Added enterprise modules, Kurios branding
4. Problem discovered: **More than half the buttons don't work** - static HTML without proper JS handlers
5. Decision: **Rebuild as full React app** with Vite + Tailwind

### React Dashboard Build (In Progress)

## GHL Calendar Settings Recap
- Use BUILT-IN Calendar Notifications (not Workflows) for:
  - Appointment Booked/Confirmed
  - Reminders (24h, 3h, 1h)
  - Cancellation/Reschedule
  - Follow-up
- Use Workflows ONLY for conditional logic (no-show, pipeline stages, Docusign)

## Cloudflare Deployment Fix
- Added package.json with dummy build script for static site
- Build command: `echo 'Static site - no build needed'`
- Dashboard repo: github.com/markoinc/goals-dashboard

## Files Created/Modified

## Key Insight from X Research
- Static HTML dashboards = bad (buttons don't work)
- React + proper state management = good
- Claude Code best practice: Use Vite + React + Tailwind for dashboards
- ClaudeX tool exists for dashboard management

## Active Spawned Tasks
- `react-dashboard-build` - Building full React app
- `fix-all-buttons` - Sent update to rebuild with React instead
