### ⚠️ CRITICAL LESSON: External Email SOP
**I sent an email to Marc Salpeter without Marko's review first. He was NOT happy.**
**NEW RULE: NEVER send external emails to prospects/clients/anyone outside the team without explicit approval.**
- Always DRAFT first → show Marko → he approves → then send
- This applies to ALL external communications
- Need to create SOP in Notion for this

### RB2B Webhook Integration — BUILT
- Webhook server at `/home/ec2-user/clawd/services/rb2b-webhook/server.js` (port 9100)
- Managed by pm2 (`rb2b-webhook` + `rb2b-tunnel`)
- Current tunnel URL: `https://quantities-warehouse-assigned-military.trycloudflare.com`
- RB2B webhook endpoint: `POST /rb2b/webhook`
- ⚠️ Tunnel URL changes on restart (trycloudflare quick tunnel) — need named tunnel or domain for permanence
- Scoring: Lawyers/legal = high score, students/interns = negative, high-intent pages = bonus
- Logs at: `services/rb2b-webhook/logs/` (all-visitors.jsonl, qualified-leads.jsonl, daily files)
- **Marko needs to paste the webhook URL into RB2B settings**: https://app.rb2b.com/integrations/webhook
- TODO: Connect qualified lead alerts to Slack channel (currently just logging)
