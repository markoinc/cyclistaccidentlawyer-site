### Tools Added
- **Apollo.io API key** added to TOOLS.md: t_j7hexbGUqksRuWZWi9hw
- Used to enrich Leventhal Puga Braley lawyer contacts

### Cold Call Script (Hormozi-style for MVA)
Created MVA-specific cold call script for RB2B website visitors:
- Opener: "Hey [Name], it's Carlos from KuriosBrand. How's it going?"
- Reason: "looks like you or someone at your firm was checking out our site around signing more MVA cases"
- Offer: signed cases, live transfers, or leads depending on intake capacity
- Guarantee: 15 cases in 30 days

### Landing Page Discussion
Carlos asked about building quick landing pages for a side project:
- Recommended: Lovable/Bolt for page + quiz
- Alternative: Carrd ($19/yr) + Tally (free quiz)
- Don't migrate to GHL - host separately, webhook leads into GHL
