# 2026-02-04 — Financial Accounting Deep Dive

## Tasks for Today
- [ ] **Research: Sell SEO-optimized websites for $5k** — Build with Clawdbot, low effort high margin. Look into: market demand, pricing validation, what "SEO optimized" means as a deliverable, how fast Clawdbot can build one, potential sales channels, packaging/positioning. Marko sees this as easy money.

## Critical Financial Facts

### January 2026 Numbers (Verified)
- **Real Revenue:** ~$9,322 cash received ($1,522 Stripe net to bank + $7,700 Zelle + $100 other)
- **Stripe Gross Collected:** $2,926.72 (10 paid charges - 1 refund), NOT $8,177 (13 charges failed)
- **Meta Ads:** $7,016.18 total across 3 payment methods (4991: $3,103, 0678: $3,102, 4252: $812)
- **Meta Ads Jan-only:** ~$5,984 (Feb charges add ~$1,032)
- **$4,200 Stripe deposit on 01/23 = LOAN, not revenue**
  - Total to repay: $5,035 ($4,200 + $835 fee, 19.9% rate)
  - Remaining: $4,705
  - 20% of every Stripe deposit AFTER 01/23 goes to repayment
  - Only 01/27 ($481.70) affected in January → ~$120 repaid

### Stripe API Connected
- Key: `~/.config/stripe/credentials.json`
- Read-only: balance, charges, customers, payouts, invoices, subscriptions
- Account: acct_1MYcAaCzRJgQ28gJ
- 13 of 24 Jan charges FAILED — clients pay via Zelle instead
- Marko corrected me: not $8k in charges, only $2,927 actually collected

### Account Mapping (11 accounts)
- Chase 4991 = Business Checking (KuriosBrand LLC)
- Chase 0068 = Personal Checking
- Chase 7036 = Savings
- Chase 0678 = Business CC (Ink)
- Chase 4252 = Personal CC (Sapphire)
- Discover 6820 = Personal CC
- Wise = International transfers
- Robinhood = Daily stock buys ($11.50/day since 01/09, was $20/day before)
- Acorns = $5/day + round-ups
- Wells Fargo = Tax account
- Stripe = Payment processor

### Profit First Analysis (Michalowicz)
- Current: 0% profit, 0% tax, 5.7% owner comp, 103% OpEx (!!)
- Target: 5% profit, 15% tax, 50% owner comp, 30% OpEx
- Meta Ads alone = 64% of revenue — exceeds entire OpEx target
- OpEx needs to drop from $9,609 → $2,797 to hit target

### Revenue Trend (Monthly)
| Month | Income | Expenses | Profit | Margin |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Jun 25 | $9,022 | $4,253 | $4,769 | 52% |
| Jul 25 | $12,688 | $3,621 | $5,737 | 45% |
| Aug 25 | $7,848 | $2,660 | $5,188 | 66% |
| Sep 25 | $6,510 | $1,962 | $4,547 | 70% |
| Nov 25 | $5,071 | $2,035 | $3,036 | 60% |
| Dec 25 | $6,326 | $3,949 | $2,377 | 38% |
| Jan 26 | ~$9,322 | ~$9,609 | -$287 | -3% |

**January was the first UNPROFITABLE month** — driven by massive Meta Ads scaling ($7k+)

## Research Sprint: PI Lawyer Website Offer (#marko-side-projects)
Working on a $12,500 AI-built website offer targeting PI lawyers. Spawned 4 parallel research agents:

### Completed Research
1. **Competitor Offer Teardown** → `/data/competitor-offer-teardown.md`
   - 9 agencies analyzed, market is homogeneous (same SEO+PPC+Web Design bundle)
   - Nobody guarantees results in dollars — all show vanity metrics
   - Pricing is hidden (except Grow Law: $2,500-$5,000/mo)
   - Nobody owns "burned by agencies" positioning — Marko's lane
   - Most behind on GEO/AI optimization

2. **PI Lawyer Buyer Psychology** → `/data/pi-lawyer-buyer-psychology.md`
   - 74% of law firms believe they've wasted money on marketing
   - #1 objection: "I've been burned before"
   - They find agencies via peer referrals (#1), Reddit (#2), then conferences
   - They MUST own their website (Scorpion = most hated agency for hostaging sites)
   - Minimum ROI expectation: 3:1
   - 1 signed PI case = $16,500+ in fees

3. **Offer Frameworks** → `/data/offer-frameworks-research.md`
   - Hormozi Grand Slam Offer applied: $40,500 perceived value for $12,500 price
   - Build First Pay Later: 93% close rate on demos (case study)
   - Free audit model: 65%+ conversion from audit to client
   - AI Visibility Score tool concept (like HubSpot grader: 4M websites graded, 40K backlinks)
   - Recommended: Stack all 5 frameworks into hybrid funnel

4. **Meta Ads for Targeting Lawyers** → `/data/meta-ads-lawyer-research.md`
   - Legal CPC on Meta: $0.86 (traffic) / $4.10 (leads) — 5-15x cheaper than Google
   - Selling marketing TO lawyers = relatively untapped on Meta
   - Orlando PI firm case study: 41 qualified leads in 30 days, 12 signed
   - Video ads are #1 format, retargeting universally works
   - Target: job titles (Attorney, Managing Partner) + interests (ABA, Clio, Avvo)

## Marko's Key Instructions
- "don't get rid of any data that was in the original sheets unless it's inaccurate"
- "Profit First principles" from the book by Mike Michalowicz (NOT first principles)
- "just january" — filter out Feb 1-4 transactions
- Only Stripe deposits AFTER the loan (01/23) are at 80% of invoice
- Failed Stripe charges = clients who pay via Zelle instead, ignore them
