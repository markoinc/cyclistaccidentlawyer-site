# MVA Lead Gen Project

**Status:** Planning Complete ✅
**Next Step:** Build MVP site

## Quick Links
- [Business Model](./BUSINESS_MODEL.md) - Two-tier vendor structure
- [Site Build Plan](./SITE_BUILD_PLAN.md) - Architecture & tech stack
- [Content Plan](./CONTENT_PLAN.md) - Content strategy & schedule

## The Concept

A review site for **PI attorneys** covering two complementary service categories:

### Category 1: Lead Vendors
MVA/PI lead generation companies (get leads)

### Category 2: Outsourced Intake Services  
Companies that handle intake calls (convert leads to signed cases)

**Free Directory:** 50+ vendors across both categories with honest reviews
**Exclusive Partners:** 
- Cases on Demand (Lead Vendor)
- Inquire2Esquire / Patrick (Intake Services)

**Monetization:** Referral fees when users book calls with exclusive partners through our platform.

## Why This Works

1. **SEO opportunity** - Attorneys search for lead gen AND intake reviews
2. **Trust moat** - Honest reviews of ALL vendors (even bad ones)
3. **Clean monetization** - Only promote partners with provably better stats
4. **Data advantage** - Aggregate performance metrics across industry
5. **Cross-sell potential** - Lead buyers need intake; pipeline play

## Key Decisions Made

- [x] Two-tier model (free directory + exclusive partners)
- [x] Two categories (Lead Vendors + Intake Services)
- [x] Booking flow through our platform (not direct to vendors)
- [x] Stat comparisons as main conversion driver
- [x] 50+ vendors for directory credibility
- [ ] Domain name TBD
- [ ] Tech stack final selection
- [ ] Partner agreement terms
