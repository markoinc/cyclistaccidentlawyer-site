## Content Interlinking Strategy

```
Pillar Pages (authority)
    ↓ links to
Vendor Directory Pages (traffic)
    ↓ links to
Comparison Pages (consideration)
    ↓ links to
Exclusive Partner Pages (conversion)
    ↓ links to
Booking Page (revenue)
```

Every piece of content should have:
1. Internal links to 2-3 related vendor pages
2. At least one CTA to exclusive partners
3. Link to relevant pillar content

---

## Exclusive Partner Content Requirements

For each exclusive partner, create:
1. **Main review page** (detailed, SEO-optimized)
2. **Comparison page** vs top 3 directory competitors
3. **Case study** (client success story)
4. **Stats infographic** (shareable, linkable)

This creates multiple entry points and conversion opportunities per partner.
