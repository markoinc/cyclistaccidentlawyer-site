## 🔥 TOP RECOMMENDATION FOR MARKO

### **START WITH: Personal Injury Law Firms OR Med Spas**

**Why PI Law Firms are #1:**
- They have THE most money and spend THE most on marketing
- A single case ($30K-$100K+ settlement × 33% contingency = $10K-$33K fee) pays for the website
- They're used to $5K-$15K/mo retainers — your $500/mo is CHEAP
- "AI search optimized" is a differentiator they'll pay premium for
- They HATE their current websites — most are from 2018-2020

**Why Med Spas are #1b:**
- Fastest growing niche in the country (18%+ YoY growth)
- New med spas opening every day = constant new demand
- They're ALREADY spending on Meta ads = warm to the platform
- Vanity industry = they care about design/branding
- Owner-operators on Instagram are easy to target with Meta ads

### Recommended Go-To-Market Strategy:
1. **Pick ONE niche to start** (PI Law or Med Spa)
2. **Build 3-5 demo sites** in that niche as portfolio pieces
3. **Create a Meta ad** targeting that niche: "Is Your Website Optimized for AI Search? Your Competitors' Isn't... Yet."
4. **Offer:** $7,500 build + $500/mo management (sweet spot pricing)
5. **Scale to the other niches** once fulfillment is dialed in

### The "AI Search" Angle — Why It's A Killer Differentiator:
- ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews are changing how people find local services
- Most websites are NOT optimized for AI crawlers
- This is a **NEW problem** = zero competition for this positioning
- Business owners are hearing about AI but don't know how to respond
- You can literally pitch: "When someone asks ChatGPT for the best [service] in [city], will YOUR business show up?"
