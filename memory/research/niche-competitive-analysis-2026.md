# Agency Niche Competitive Analysis
## Website-Building Agencies Targeting Specific Niches via Paid Ads
**Date:** February 4, 2026 | **For:** Marko — Kurios Brand

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Marko's offer: **SEO-optimized, AI-optimized websites for $5K-$10K + $500/mo management** via Meta ads.

**Key Finding:** $500/mo management is an absolute steal in most service niches where businesses already spend $2K-$10K/mo on marketing. The trick is avoiding oversaturated agency niches (roofing, dental, legal) and targeting industries where business owners NEED websites but aren't being carpet-bombed by agency ads. The sweet spot is **high customer lifetime value + low agency competition + digital marketing immaturity.**

### Meta Ad Saturation by Niche (Agency Competition Level)

**🔴 OVERSATURATED (50+ agencies actively running Meta ads):**
- Roofing — Every agency and their mother targets roofers
- HVAC — Second most targeted by agencies after roofing
- Dental — Massive agency competition, commoditized pricing
- Personal Injury Law — Highest CPC in existence, agency competition fierce
- Real Estate — Too many generalists, race to the bottom

**🟡 COMPETITIVE BUT NOT SATURATED (15-50 agencies):**
- Plumbing — Moderate competition, still opportunity
- General Contracting — Growing agency attention
- Med Spa / Aesthetics — Rising fast, getting crowded
- Auto Repair — Moderate agency presence
- Electrical — Less than HVAC/roofing but growing

**🟢 UNDERSERVED (< 15 niche-specific agencies):**
- Veterinary Clinics — Very few specialized agencies
- Funeral Homes — Taboo niche, most agencies avoid it
- Senior Care / Home Health — Specialized but underserved
- Solar Installers — Growing industry, few web agencies
- Pest Control — Moderate but not oversaturated
- Chiropractors — Some agencies but not flooded
- Accounting/CPA Firms — Very underserved digitally
- Physical Therapy — Few specialized providers
- Landscaping/Tree Service — Low agency attention
- Commercial Cleaning — Almost no specialized agencies

## 2. PRICING COMPARISON: Where $5K-$10K Website + $500/mo Is Competitive

### Website Design Costs by Industry (What Businesses Currently Pay)

| Industry | Typical Website Cost | Monthly Mgmt/SEO | Your $5K-10K + $500/mo |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Dental | $6,000 - $25,000 | $1,000 - $4,000 | **50-75% cheaper on monthly** |
| Legal (small firm) | $5,000 - $25,000 | $3,000 - $20,000 | **80-97% cheaper on monthly** |
| HVAC | $3,000 - $10,000 | $1,000 - $3,000 | **Competitive on site, 50-80% cheaper monthly** |
| Roofing | $3,000 - $10,000 | $1,000 - $3,000 | **Competitive on site, 50-80% cheaper monthly** |
| Med Spa | $5,000 - $15,000 | $999 - $3,000 | **50-80% cheaper on monthly** |
| Veterinary | $3,000 - $8,000 | $500 - $2,000 | **Competitive across the board** |
| Funeral Home | $3,000 - $10,000 | $1,500 - $3,000 | **65-80% cheaper on monthly** |
| Accounting/CPA | $2,000 - $8,000 | $500 - $2,000 | **Competitive, great value prop** |
| Physical Therapy | $2,000 - $10,000 | $500 - $2,000 | **Competitive across the board** |
| Construction | $3,000 - $10,000 | $1,000 - $3,000 | **50-80% cheaper on monthly** |
| Pest Control | $3,000 - $8,000 | $1,000 - $3,000 | **50-80% cheaper on monthly** |

**KEY INSIGHT:** $500/mo is a bargain in EVERY niche. Most agencies charge $1K-$5K/mo for ongoing management. The question isn't whether $500/mo is competitive — it is — the question is which niches have owners who UNDERSTAND they need a website and will pay $5K-$10K upfront.

## 3. MARKETING SPEND BY INDUSTRY (Where $500/mo Is an Easy Sell)

### Industries Where Average Monthly Marketing Spend is $2K-$10K+

| Industry | Avg Revenue | Marketing % | Monthly Marketing Spend | $500/mo as % of Budget |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **HVAC** | $1-5M | 7-10% | **$2,000 - $11,000** | 4.5-25% ✅ |
| **Dental Practice** | $1-2M | 5-6% | **$1,700 - $11,666** | 4.3-29% ✅ |
| **Law Firm (small)** | $500K-5M | 7-10% | **$5,000 - $50,000** | 1-10% ✅ |
| **Med Spa** | $500K-2M | 5-15% | **$3,000 - $11,000** | 4.5-17% ✅ |
| **Roofing** | $1-5M | 5-10% | **$2,000 - $10,000** | 5-25% ✅ |
| **Pest Control** | $500K-5M | 5-10% | **$2,000 - $5,000** | 10-25% ✅ |
| **Construction/GC** | $1-10M | 3-10% | **$1,000 - $10,000+** | 5-50% ✅ |
| **Funeral Home** | $500K-1.5M | 7.5-15% | **$3,000 - $10,000+** | 5-17% ✅ |
| **Senior Living** | $1-5M | 5-10% | **$4,000 - $5,000** (PPC alone) | 10-12.5% ✅ |
| **Veterinary** | $600K-2M | 2-5% | **$500 - $2,000** | 25-100% ⚠️ |
| **Chiropractic** | $300K-1M | 5-10% | **$1,000 - $3,000** | 17-50% ⚠️ |
| **PT Practice** | $500K-2M | 10% | **$1,000 - $2,000** | 25-50% ⚠️ |
| **Accounting/CPA** | $300K-2M | 1-3% | **$500 - $1,500** | 33-100% ⚠️ |
| **Solar Installer** | $1-10M | 5% | **$2,000 - $10,000** | 5-25% ✅ |

**✅ = $500/mo is an easy line item** (< 25% of marketing budget)
**⚠️ = Tighter sell** (> 25% of budget — but these niches have lower agency competition)

## 4. NICHE SELECTION FRAMEWORKS

### The Blueprint Training Framework (from deep-dive article)
Three critical questions for evaluating niche profitability:

1. **Does your service directly result in leads/sales?** → Website + SEO = bottom-of-funnel lead gen
2. **Is there significant demand for the client's offering?** → Check search volume for "[service] near me"
3. **What is the value of a single customer?** → Higher = easier to justify your fees

Their top picks: Men's Cosmetic/Elective Procedures, Home Services, Professional Services (mid-market).

### Josh Nelson / Seven Figure Agency Framework
**"Rule of Five Ones":**
1. **One target market** (single niche)
2. **One core offer** (your website + management package)
3. **One lead generation strategy** (Meta ads for you)
4. **One conversion mechanism** (your sales process)
5. **One-year commitment** to this focused strategy

**His niche selection criteria:**
- Check the marketing spend (do they invest in marketing?)
- Gauge the market size (aim for at least 10,000 businesses)
- Look for industry associations (networking goldmine)
- Spot the events (trade shows = sales opportunities)
- Follow your passion

Josh himself built his agency to $4.5M/yr ARR focusing on **Plumbing & HVAC**. He averages 5 new clients/month at $1,500/mo each. Home services are his #1 recommendation because they're "recession-resistant."

### Mitch Wiggins Framework
Mitch Wiggins (MitchWiggins.com) is a coaching business coach rather than a traditional agency niche coach. His framework focuses on:
- **Niche + Offer** combination (not just niche alone)
- **Content-led lead generation** (no paid ads, no cold DMs)
- **Organic client attraction** through content that sells
- Target: $10K-$25K/month coaching businesses

His approach is more coaching-business oriented than agency-specific, but the niche+offer principle applies: **Don't just pick a niche — pair it with an irresistible offer that solves their #1 pain.**

For Marko's context, the Wiggins principle would be: "SEO-optimized website" is the niche offer, but the REAL offer should be framed as the business outcome: **"Get 20+ new customers per month from Google without paying for ads forever."**

### Combined Scoring Framework (My Synthesis)

**NICHE SCORE = (Customer LTV × Marketing Budget × Market Size) ÷ (Agency Competition × Sales Difficulty)**

Factors to weigh:
| Factor | Weight | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Customer Lifetime Value | 25% | Higher LTV = easier to justify $5-10K website |
| Monthly Marketing Budget | 20% | Must be $2K+ for $500/mo to be easy |
| Market Size (# of businesses) | 15% | Need enough prospects for Meta ads |
| Agency Competition | 20% | Fewer agencies = easier to win |
| Sales Difficulty | 10% | How easy is it to close? |
| Digital Maturity | 10% | Less digitally mature = more opportunity |

## 5. TOP 10 UNDERSERVED BUT HIGH-POTENTIAL NICHES

### 🥇 #1: Med Spas / Aesthetics Clinics
**Score: 9.2/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Customer LTV | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $5,000+ per patient/year, repeat treatments |
| Monthly Marketing Spend | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $3,000-$11,000/mo average |
| Market Size | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ~10,000+ med spas in US, growing 15%+ annually |
| Agency Competition | ⭐⭐⭐ | Getting competitive but not saturated yet |
| Sales Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Owners are image-conscious, understand marketing |
| Digital Maturity | ⭐⭐⭐ | Instagram-native but websites often terrible |

**Why it's gold:** Med spa owners are marketers by nature — they understand aesthetics, branding, and the need for a premium online presence. They're already spending $3K-$11K/mo on ads. A $5K-$10K beautiful website + $500/mo management is an absolute no-brainer for them. The industry is booming (projected $50B+ by 2030). Many have cookie-cutter templates that look generic.

**Ad angle:** "Your med spa's website is losing you $10K+/month in botox appointments. We build conversion-optimized websites that turn browsers into bookings."

---

### 🥈 #2: Pest Control Companies
**Score: 8.9/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Customer LTV | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $500-$2,000/year recurring, high retention |
| Monthly Marketing Spend | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $2,000-$5,000/mo |
| Market Size | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 35,000+ pest control companies in US |
| Agency Competition | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Only a handful of specialized agencies (Cube Creative) |
| Sales Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Practical business owners, value ROI |
| Digital Maturity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Most have outdated websites, ripe for upgrade |

**Why it's gold:** Massive market, recurring revenue model (quarterly treatments), business owners who understand marketing ROI. Customer acquisition cost is ~$250 and a new customer is worth $1,500-$4,000 in lifetime value. Very few agencies specialize here. $500/mo is less than the cost of ONE new customer.

**Ad angle:** "Your pest control website hasn't been updated since 2019. That's costing you 5+ calls per week. We build websites that rank #1 in your city — guaranteed."

---

### 🥉 #3: Senior Care / Home Health Agencies
**Score: 8.7/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Customer LTV | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $4,500/mo per resident/client = $54K+/year |
| Monthly Marketing Spend | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $4,000-$5,000/mo (PPC alone) |
| Market Size | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 30,000+ assisted living facilities + 33,000+ home health agencies |
| Agency Competition | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Very few specialized agencies |
| Sales Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐ | Emotional sale, owners are typically business-savvy |
| Digital Maturity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Terribly outdated websites, massive opportunity |

**Why it's gold:** One new resident = $54K/year in revenue. Cost per lead is $400+. These businesses can easily justify $5K-$10K for a website that generates even ONE additional family inquiry per month. Most senior care websites look like they were built in 2010. The decision-makers (adult children researching for aging parents) are 35-55 year olds who judge HARD on website quality.

**Ad angle:** "Families researching senior care for their parents check your website first. If it looks outdated, they click to your competitor. We build trust-building websites that turn worried families into tours."

---

### #4: Solar Installation Companies
**Score: 8.5/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Customer LTV | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $15,000-$40,000 per installation |
| Monthly Marketing Spend | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $2,000-$10,000/mo |
| Market Size | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 10,000+ solar companies, growing rapidly |
| Agency Competition | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Few specialized web design agencies for solar |
| Sales Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Tech-forward owners, understand digital |
| Digital Maturity | ⭐⭐⭐ | Mixed — some good, many bad |

**Why it's gold:** Average solar installation is $15K-$40K. One website-generated lead that converts pays for the entire website + years of management. Industry is booming with IRA incentives still active. Solar companies spend 5%+ of revenue on marketing. Very few agencies specialize in solar web design.

**Ad angle:** "Your solar company's website isn't generating leads because it's not optimized for 'solar installation near me.' We build websites that rank on Google and convert homeowners into consultations."

---

### #5: Funeral Homes & Cremation Services
**Score: 8.3/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Customer LTV | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $7,000-$12,000 per service (one-time but high) |
| Monthly Marketing Spend | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $3,000-$10,000/mo |
| Market Size | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 19,000+ funeral homes in US |
| Agency Competition | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Only 2-3 specialized agencies (Ring Ring, MKJ) |
| Sales Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐ | Sensitive industry, requires tact |
| Digital Maturity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Most websites are ancient, terrible UX |

**Why it's gold:** Most agencies avoid this niche because it feels "uncomfortable" — that's exactly why it's underserved. Funeral homes spend $78K-$157K/year on marketing (7.5-15% of revenue). Their websites are almost universally terrible. Families making funeral arrangements are often doing Google searches in an emergency/emotional state — website quality directly impacts which funeral home gets the call. ZERO competition for Meta ads selling websites to funeral homes.

**Ad angle:** "87% of families Google funeral homes before calling. If your website looks outdated or cold, they'll call someone else. We build warm, professional websites that honor your brand and bring families to your door."

---

### #6: Veterinary Clinics
**Score: 8.0/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Customer LTV | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $500-$1,000/year, but 10+ year relationships |
| Monthly Marketing Spend | ⭐⭐⭐ | $500-$2,000/mo (lower than others) |
| Market Size | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 33,000+ veterinary clinics in US |
| Agency Competition | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Very few (GeniusVets is the main one) |
| Sales Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Vets are educated, appreciate quality |
| Digital Maturity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Most have basic/outdated websites |

**Why it's gold:** Huge market with almost no agency competition. Pet spending is at all-time highs ($186B in 2024). Vet clinics generate $300K-$600K per veterinarian. The average vet practice has a website that was set up by their practice management software and looks generic. Very low marketing spend ceiling means $500/mo has to be framed as the ENTIRE marketing budget, not an add-on. Best if you bundle the $500/mo to include basic local SEO + site management.

**Ad angle:** "Pet owners are Googling 'vet near me' 100,000 times per day. Is your clinic showing up? We build websites that rank #1 locally and make pet owners choose YOU."

---

### #7: Chiropractors & Physical Therapy Clinics
**Score: 7.8/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Customer LTV | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $1,000-$5,000/year per patient |
| Monthly Marketing Spend | ⭐⭐⭐ | $1,000-$3,000/mo |
| Market Size | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 70,000+ chiropractors + 40,000+ PT clinics |
| Agency Competition | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Some agencies but not saturated |
| Sales Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Health professionals, understand patient acquisition |
| Digital Maturity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Many use template sites from practice management tools |

**Why it's gold:** Enormous combined market (110K+ businesses). A single new patient generates $1K-$5K in treatment plans. $500/mo for a practice spending $1K-$3K on marketing is a significant but justifiable spend. Many chiro/PT practices use horrible template websites from their EHR provider (like Jane App or ChiroTouch).

**Ad angle:** "Your ChiroTouch template website looks like every other chiropractor in town. We build custom websites that get you found on Google and make patients book online — adding 10+ new patients/month."

---

### #8: Commercial Cleaning / Janitorial Services
**Score: 7.7/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Customer LTV | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $12,000-$50,000+/year per commercial contract |
| Monthly Marketing Spend | ⭐⭐⭐ | $500-$3,000/mo (growing) |
| Market Size | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 100,000+ cleaning companies in US |
| Agency Competition | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Almost ZERO specialized agencies |
| Sales Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐ | Many are immigrant-owned, some language barriers |
| Digital Maturity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Most have no website or terrible Wix sites |

**Why it's gold:** Massive market with virtually zero agency competition. One commercial cleaning contract = $12K-$50K+/year. These business owners KNOW they need a professional website to land bigger contracts (offices, medical facilities, etc.) but most are using a free Wix or no website at all. The $5K-$10K website could be positioned as an investment that lands their first $50K/year contract.

**Ad angle:** "Property managers Google cleaning companies before requesting bids. No website = no contract. We build professional websites that help you land $50K+ commercial contracts."

---

### #9: Landscaping & Tree Service Companies
**Score: 7.5/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Customer LTV | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $2,000-$10,000+/year (maintenance contracts) |
| Monthly Marketing Spend | ⭐⭐⭐ | $1,000-$5,000/mo |
| Market Size | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 600,000+ landscaping businesses in US |
| Agency Competition | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Some agencies but mostly generalists |
| Sales Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Practical owners, understand ROI |
| Digital Maturity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Most have terrible or no websites |

**Why it's gold:** Absolutely massive market (600K+ businesses). Seasonal business means they're hungry for leads in spring/summer. Many landscapers have grown organically through word-of-mouth and have embarrassingly bad websites. Tree service is especially high-ticket ($500-$5,000+ per job) with strong "near me" search intent.

**Ad angle:** "You built your landscaping business through word-of-mouth. Now it's time to build it through Google. We create websites that put you in front of every homeowner searching 'landscaping company near me.'"

---

### #10: Accounting Firms & Bookkeeping Services
**Score: 7.3/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Customer LTV | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $3,000-$12,000+/year per client |
| Monthly Marketing Spend | ⭐⭐ | $500-$1,500/mo (lowest of all niches) |
| Market Size | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 130,000+ accounting firms in US |
| Agency Competition | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Almost no specialized agencies |
| Sales Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐ | Analytical, need data to justify spend |
| Digital Maturity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Many have no website or use free templates |

**Why it's gold:** Only 14% of solo attorneys have a marketing budget — CPAs are likely even worse. But the industry is TRANSFORMING. AI bookkeeping tools are forcing CPAs to differentiate. A professional website becomes essential for survival. The challenge: low marketing budgets mean $500/mo is a bigger commitment. Position it as "your only marketing expense" rather than an add-on.

**Ad angle:** "AI is replacing basic bookkeeping. Your website needs to show clients why they need YOUR expertise — not a robot. We build authority websites that position your firm as the trusted advisor."

## 6. OVERSATURATED NICHES TO AVOID

### 🚫 Do NOT Target These (Unless You Have Domain Expertise)

1. **Roofing** — Most agency-targeted niche in existence. You'd be competing with Roofing Webmasters, Hook Agency, Roofer Marketers, and 100+ others all running the same Meta ads.

2. **HVAC** — Second most targeted. ServiceTitan, Scorpion, Hook Agency all dominate. Owners are flooded with pitches.

3. **Dental** — Oversaturated with agencies. Pain Free Dental Marketing, DentalScapes, Dental Marketo, etc. Every agency coach uses dental as an example.

4. **Personal Injury Law** — Most expensive CPCs in all of digital marketing ($100-$500/click for some terms). Agencies like Rankings.io charge $5K-$20K/mo. You'd be bringing a knife to a gunfight.

5. **Real Estate** — Commoditized. Agents have $0-$500/mo budgets. Impossible to sell $5K-$10K websites when they have IDX templates.

6. **Restaurants/Bars** — Razor-thin margins, can't afford $5K websites. High churn.

7. **General E-commerce** — Too broad, too competitive, Shopify templates are "good enough."

---

## 7. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Pricing Position
Your $5K-$10K + $500/mo is priced in a **sweet spot** that's:
- **Above** DIY/template solutions ($0-$2K) → You offer real value
- **Below** established niche agencies ($10K-$25K + $2K-5K/mo) → You're the affordable expert
- **The "Goldilocks zone"** for business owners doing $500K-$5M in revenue

### Meta Ad Strategy by Niche
For each niche, the Meta ad creative should:
1. **Call out the niche** in the first 3 seconds ("Attention Pest Control Owners...")
2. **Show a before/after** of a terrible website vs. a beautiful one
3. **Name the outcome** ("Get 30+ calls per month from Google")
4. **Anchor the price against their current spend** ("You spend $3K/mo on ads that go to a $500 website...")

### Recommended Starting Niches (Pick 2 to Test)

**If you want fastest close rates:** Med Spas + Pest Control
- Med spa owners are marketing-savvy and will pay for aesthetics
- Pest control owners are practical ROI-focused buyers

**If you want biggest TAM:** Landscaping + Commercial Cleaning
- 700K+ combined businesses, almost zero competition
- Lower average deal size risk but massive volume

**If you want highest LTV clients:** Senior Care + Solar
- One client could stay for years at $500/mo
- Both have massive customer LTV ($15K-$54K/year)

### The "AI-Optimized" Angle
This is your differentiator. NOBODY is selling "AI-optimized" websites yet. Frame it as:
- "Built for how people search in 2026 — voice search, AI assistants, Google AI Overviews"
- "Your website needs to feed data to AI systems that recommend businesses"
- "If ChatGPT can't find your business, you're invisible to 40% of searchers"

This angle makes you impossible to compare to competitors selling "just websites."
