**Max Berry:** Hello.

**Jeremy Wood:** Hey.

**Max Berry:** How are you doing?

**Jeremy Wood:** Good. February 5th. That was yesterday. Okay. I'm good. How are you?

**Max Berry:** Good, good, good. I think XRP is about to break out.

**Jeremy Wood:** Boy, I hope you're right.

**Max Berry:** Oh, my God. I scooped up some two nights ago when it was, or a day ago when it was $1.16. I said to Lauren, I was like, XRP's on sale. And she's like, oh, my God. She's like, what are I'm like, it's on sale.

**Jeremy Wood:** It's cheap. Yeah.

**Max Berry:** Oh, man. But how about the market? I mean, it's getting decimated. Yeah. I mean, it's burning. It's going down. Live. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was going to happen this year. I mean, it was so inflated. Yeah. mean, I was just, I've just been waiting, waiting for the day.

**Jeremy Wood:** Well, what was it? I saw a lot of them were Bitcoin went down.

**Max Berry:** Bitcoin went from 73 to 60 in about during the workday.

**Jeremy Wood:** Yeah.

**Max Berry:** I mean, and then recovered a bit. Yeah. But 60 grand and it was 126 in October.

[Small talk about crypto/markets continues...]

**Max Berry:** Mark.

**Marko:** Wow. I get to see Jeremy.

**Jeremy Wood:** Hey, Jeremy. Yeah, how's it going, Mark?

**Marko:** Good, how are you?

**Max Berry:** Okay, so I only have eight minutes because I have a sales call. I'm feeling a little shy, so I'm not getting on camera either. I just, honestly, the last two weeks, I've done more Zooms than in the last two years.

**Jeremy Wood:** I mean, Jeremy, you know, I don't do... Yeah, Max doesn't do Yeah, just get on the phone.

**Max Berry:** I like to walk around. I like to, you know, I don't like to be in front of my computer. I like to just move, be out on the deck or whatever.

So, so yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Friday. No, no vid for me.

Okay, so I wanted to run Mark real quick through, uh, it won't take, honestly, five minutes, think, um, through what he should do on an onboarding call or a kickoff call and what he should go over with them, what he should cover and that sort of thing.

So let me kick, kick us off with what I think are the, the main things. And then Jeremy definitely has, you know, fun.

**So the first thing is like, you're telling them what's going to happen next.** So, you know, your, you know, your campaign is going to go live. You should get leads in, you know, **24 to 48 hours from going live**. Okay. It's actually going to happen like the same day. But if it doesn't, we don't want them being like, is it live? Like, you know, what's going on? Because that's just, that's just drag on your time.

**So then you want to tell them that when it goes live, it may take 10 to 20 leads, maybe even 25 on the high end, before conversions start coming in.** Because you're going to be getting, you know, a lead or two a day, and you're calling them right away, and you're following up with them.

But you're not going to speak to everyone the same day you get the lead. So it takes, takes time to start having the conversations.

And then, you know, if the conversion rate is... **One out of seven, one out of eight, 15%, you know, you need to have, you know, at least 15 conversations** before it's like, you know, you're not going to get a case in the first seven conversations exactly is the point.

Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Right. The probabilities are, you know, that you need a little bit larger numbers.

**So don't be concerned, Mr. Client, if, you know, you get 10 leads and you haven't signed anything and nothing has popped off.**

And then I would tell them, **you're also going to get a bunch of different types of conversations:**
- You're going to get cases that you signed that you're excited to work with the client.
- And then you're going to get cases that, you know, were just off and maybe they had a gap in treatment or maybe they had, you know, whatever. They, they, they, were at fault and then you turn them down
- And then there's going to be people that told you they didn't even fill out a form, and that they weren't in an accident, and they hang up on you.
- People that tell you that, you know, there could be people that tell you that their car got shot. You know, it's still a car accident, but it got, you know, it got shot up or whatever.

Like, all kinds of crazy situations. **Do not be concerned as this happens, because you're just working through the leads to find the cases, okay?**

Yeah. I would say those are the main things, but Jeremy, want you to jump in, and I'm sure there might be additional things.

**And I think it's very important to have these calls.**

**Jeremy Wood:** I don't think we have them enough.

**Max Berry:** Yeah, you're right. You know, we should, now that we're kind of taking our time back, we should get, you know, really get on that, because it sets the expectation for renewal, you know, and for, like, the whole thing.

So they understand, you know. What to expect. Now, with bigger buyers that have experience with leads, it is less important, you know, and if time is a factor and you're busy selling, you know, Jeremy, think you can agree, like, you know, some of those you can kind of, if they have an intake team and they already work internet leads, you may be able to get away with no kickoff call explaining all this.

Would you say it's beneficial for everyone?

**Jeremy Wood:** I would fault to the side of having a kickoff call with everyone, if possible. We were on with Bush and Bush yesterday, and they've got a giant intake team, but it's clear that they don't know what they're doing.

Um, so we had to, we had to go through all of the, the basics, uh, which, which. I'll get into that.

So I would say yes. If you have the time, try to make it a priority to talk to everybody as they get started.

**But the thing that I always tell them is if you're going to get results from your campaign, you have to dial the lead immediately within five minutes of that lead coming in.**

If they don't pick up the phone, you have to dial them up to four times. I'm sorry, not up to four times.

**Four times the first day. Like, it's four times day one, three times every subsequent day for at least a week, preferably two.**

And that lets them know, you know, because some of them think, I dialed this person five times. Five times should have been day one.

They just don't. They don't have any experience with running leads down. So you just have to tell them that.

And that's what I usually go over. Max, are we, I know you got to go.

**Max Berry:** So no, no, I, are they jumping on to lead?

**Jeremy Wood:** Leadbyte? Are they walking through Leadbyte during their call?

**Marko:** Leadbyte.

**Max Berry:** So, well, no, because Mark is going to handle delivery, so he'll show them high level if he wants to.

Then that's it for me. Okay. Yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. Do you have additional questions, Mark?

**Marko:** Because, Jeremy, do you have a call? I needed something from Jeremy for the actual leads. Can you just send them to my webhook, and I handle everything else?

**Max Berry:** Yeah, yeah. Jeremy, we need it. Jeremy, put together an API email with Mark, and then, Mark, you'll give the Just respond to that email.

**Jeremy Wood:** I'll have it overwrite now, Mark.

**Max Berry:** Just respond with the webhook.

**Jeremy Wood:** Yeah, we could do that. Yeah, the API team will Okay, wonderful.

**Max Berry:** Awesome. All right.

**Jeremy Wood:** Oh, Mark, let me ask you a question while you're here.

**Max Berry:** Yeah, I can jump, and you can say.

**Jeremy Wood:** You're the host. All cool. So, I've got an onboarding form that's ready to go out. All cool. cool. Or who was it?

**Marko:** Okay.

**Jeremy Wood:** I just need to confirm.

**Marko:** Salpeter?

**Jeremy Wood:** Curious Brent. Yes. Yep. Is that Ohio leads? Or which state or states are they going to?

**Marko:** Just Ohio.

**Jeremy Wood:** Just Ohio. Perfect. All right. Yeah, that's really all I needed. Yeah. All right, man. That's it for me. Okay, cool.

**Marko:** All right.

**Jeremy Wood:** Wonderful. Thank you, Jeremy. Good to talk to you, man. Have a good one.

**Marko:** You too. Bye.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Mandatory Kickoff Calls:** Kickoff calls are mandatory for all clients to set realistic expectations on lead volume, conversion timing, and lead quality, preventing churn.

2. **Aggressive Follow-Up Protocol:** Clients must call leads within 5 minutes of receipt and follow a strict schedule (4x Day 1, 3x/day for 1–2 weeks) to maximize contact rates.

3. **Technical Handover:** Marko will provide a webhook via email to the API team for lead delivery, enabling him to manage the process independently.

4. **Client Confirmation:** The "Curious Brent" client (Marc Salpeter) lead delivery is confirmed for Ohio only.
