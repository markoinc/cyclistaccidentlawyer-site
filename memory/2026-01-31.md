## Marko's Goals (CRITICAL)
- **Ultimate:** $9.6M business exit - fully automated, high margin
- **Short-term:** 2-3 client acquisition sales calls/day at lowest cost per call
- Everything I do should filter through: "Does this get Marko closer to 2-3 calls/day?"

## Dashboard Mission
- Built comprehensive dashboard at `/home/ec2-user/clawd/dashboard.html`
- Goal tracker at top showing calls today, cost/call, pipeline value

  - Avatar types (Fast Scaler, Burned Veteran, Solo Transitioner, etc.)
  - Recommended approach for each
  - Budget info, company names, detailed notes from call transcripts
- Added "Next Actions" section highlighting highest priority prospects
- Lucas Naccarati flagged as TOP PRIORITY (Fast Scaler, 89 score, 80% close)

## Concrete Sites Question
Marko asked about moving WordPress sites from 10web.io to Cloudflare:
- Answer: Won't hurt rankings if done correctly (same domain, same content, same URLs)
- Actually beneficial: Cloudflare faster → better Core Web Vitals
- Scheduled exploration session for Feb 5

## Patrick is #1 Differentiator
Key insight from call analysis: Patrick's "former director of intake" background is the primary closing factor across all avatar types. Emphasize this in every pitch.
