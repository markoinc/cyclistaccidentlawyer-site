# 2026-02-01 Overnight Session Summary

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Overnight Swarm Completed (6 head agents)
All completed successfully:
- **Memory & SOPs** → `/home/ec2-user/clawd/data/knowledge-base/` (projects, SOPs, ideas, goals, contacts, decisions)
- **Dashboard** → Sierra Command Center built at `/home/ec2-user/clawd/canvas/dashboard-v2.html` (89KB, $9.6M tracker, kanban, revenue dashboard)
- **X Scraper** → Best practices at `~/clawd/data/x-best-practices.md`
- **MVA Competitor** → Quintessa vulnerable, Rankings.io = $10K+ (too expensive)
- **De-Neuralyzer** → Context recovery system at `~/clawd/data/de-neuralyzer/`
- **Notion Update** → Update doc created (can't push to indexsy.notion.site directly)

### 2. Competitor Analysis
**Top 3 PI Lead Gen Vendors (best sentiment):**
1. 4LegalLeads (4.9/5 Trustpilot, ABA Partner)
2. Legal Brand Marketing (A+ BBB, compliance-focused)
3. Walker Advertising (40+ yrs, Los Defensores brand)

**Gap nobody fills:** AI pre-qualification + pay-per-signed-retainer

### 3. Discord Multi-Agent Setup
- Discord channel added to Clawdbot ✅
- Bot token configured: `MTQ2NzQxNzQ4NzI3MTUyNjQ2NQ.GFmeuh...`
- Need to enable Message Content Intent in Discord Developer Portal
- Bot is online as @Sierra

### 4. 8 Head Agent Architecture Decided
| Agent | Focus | Model Tier |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Scout | Research & Intel | Opus |
| Forge | SEO & Content | Opus |
| Spark | Meta Ads + LLM/ChatGPT Ads ONLY | Opus |
| Hunter | Sales & Pipeline | Opus |
| Gears | Automation & Ops | Opus |
| Echo | LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram, Facebook ONLY | Opus |
| Lens | Analytics & Reporting | Opus |
| Sierra | Strategy & Orchestration | Opus |

**Architecture:** Option B (separate instances) with:
- Superconscious = Supermemory + shared files
- Intelligent model routing (Opus → Sonnet → Haiku based on task)
- Autonomous collaboration in Discord

### 5. Site Updates
- **kuriosnew** (leads site): Sticky CTA moved to bottom (mobile only), chat widget homepage only
- **kuriosbrand**: Same updates, but auto-deploy issues (Cloudflare not triggering)
- Both repos have git history, code review completed

### 6. Key Context Updates
- **Patrick no longer on first touch calls** - need to adjust value prop
- **AI Intake Agent is 90% complete** - just needs OpenAI API key in `.env`
- **Model research agent running** - building capabilities database for intelligent routing
