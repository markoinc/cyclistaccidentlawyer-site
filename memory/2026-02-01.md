### Pre-Call Video Creation
- Marko exploring AI video tools for pre-call videos

### Knowledge Base Build - IN PROGRESS
- Marko requested comprehensive knowledge bases for:
  1. **Meta Ads** - 20+ videos on ads, creative, scaling
  2. **Nano Banana Pro** - AI ad creative generation
  3. **Sales Funnels** - Booking flows, follow-ups, SMS sequences

- **BLOCKER**: YouTube blocking AWS IP for transcripts
  - All agents found videos but couldn't transcribe
  - Video lists saved to `/data/meta-ads-knowledge/`
  
- **Solution in progress**: WebShare residential proxies
  - Marko signing up for WebShare (~$6/mo)
  - Need RESIDENTIAL PROXIES (not static or proxy server)
  - Get credentials from Dashboard → Proxy → Settings
  - youtube-transcript-api has built-in WebshareProxyConfig support

### System Updates
- Notion now for SOPs ONLY (not research/reports)
- Supermemory for everything else (research, memory, context)
- Updated TOOLS.md with this distinction

### Pending
- [ ] Get WebShare credentials from Marko
- [ ] Run batch transcription with residential proxy
- [ ] Compile Meta Ads knowledge base
- [ ] Compile Sales Funnel knowledge base
