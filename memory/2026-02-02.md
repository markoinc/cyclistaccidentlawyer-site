## Session Summary (07:55 - 17:22 UTC)

### Google Calendar Token Issue
- Token expired at 07:42 UTC
- Marko re-authed last night (~06:42 UTC / 1:42am Peru)
- Issue: OAuth access tokens expire after 1 hour, auto-refresh wasn't kicking in
- **FIXED**: Manually refreshed token using refresh_token grant
- Calendar access restored and working

### Google Drive Issues - CRITICAL
**Missing files (deleted by unknown party):**
- `Kurios Performance Sheet` (ID: `1aFiWHBiugUKLK-fkRru8HcbTVfP6NQHkXjvPhVnXasU`) - 404
- `The High Level 20%` folder (ID: `1sHN7ZbgvWYVaElYNj3LuD45gU8uACdkL`) - 404
- Neither in sierra@kuriosbrand.com trash
- **I did NOT delete these** - logs show only READ operations

**What survived:**
- Carlos folder (`1qshu4wTkayK-3C_h8nPEy_YWtWoaPAUX`) still exists with 12 files
- Files that were IN the High Level 20% folder are now in main Carlos folder
- Local backups of pricing data exist at `/home/ec2-user/clawd/data/guarantee-calculator.md`

**Action needed:** Marko should check his personal Drive trash, or I can recreate the sheet

### Sierra Google Account Password
- Marko shared password for sierra@kuriosbrand.com: `S!erra2026_KBrand#Secure`
- Message was deleted for security

### MVA Buyer Research
**Round 1 (11:57 UTC):**
- Key finding: TRUST is biggest hurdle - market poisoned by bad actors
- Winning formula: EXCLUSIVE + SCREENED + FAST + TRANSPARENT
- Attorneys will pay $300-500 for leads meeting all criteria

**Round 2 (15:57 UTC):**
- **CA SB 37 Compliance** - California law reclassifies "buying signed cases" as illegal lawyer referral
- Many lead gen firms PULLING OUT of California
- This is a major differentiator for Kurios positioning
- Power stats: 79% hire FIRST attorney who responds helpfully
- 5 min response = 21x more likely to convert
- 8 new commenting opportunities added to Notion

### Carlos Request
- Created Google Meet background with Kurios branding
- 1920x1080, dark gradient with Kurios logo bottom-right
- Saved to `/home/ec2-user/clawd/canvas/meet-background.png`
- Sent via Slack

### Telegram Issue
- Telegram `sendMessage` returning 404 all session
- Discord messages working fine
- Marko's direct messages coming through, but proactive sends failing

### Dashboard & Agents
- Dashboard auto-refreshing every 5 min (working)
- Agent squad activations every 30 min (Discord working)
- Notion tracking: 100 buyer research blocks, 4 commenting opp blocks

### Calculator Status
- MVA Calculator built at `/home/ec2-user/clawd/apps/mva-calculator/`
- Deployed to goals-dashboard repo
- Issue: admin.kuriosbrand.com/calculator/ returns 403 (geo-block or access issue)
- Marko asked about deploying it - awaiting decision on deployment method

## Key Files
- Meet background: `/home/ec2-user/clawd/canvas/meet-background.html` and `.png`
- Pricing data backup: `/home/ec2-user/clawd/data/guarantee-calculator.md`
- Token file: `~/.config/gcal-pro/token.json`

## TODO
- [ ] Recreate Kurios Performance Sheet if Marko can't recover from trash
- [ ] Fix calculator deployment (embed in dashboard or separate subdomain)
- [ ] Investigate Telegram 404 issue
- [ ] Set up auto-refresh cron for gcal token (every 45 min)
