## Core Metrics Defined

### CTR (Click-Through Rate)
**What it is:** Percentage of people who clicked your ad after seeing it.

**Formula:** `(Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100`

| Rating | CTR | What It Means |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| 🔴 Bad | < 0.5% | Ad creative or targeting is off. People aren't interested. |
| 🟡 Average | 0.5% - 1.0% | Functional but room for improvement. |
| 🟢 Good | 1.0% - 2.0% | Solid performance, resonating with audience. |
| 🌟 Excellent | > 2.0% | High relevance. Creative + targeting dialed in. |

**B2B Note:** B2B typically sees lower CTRs than B2C (0.5-1.2% is normal). Decision-makers are more deliberate.

---

### CPM (Cost Per Mille / 1,000 Impressions)
**What it is:** How much you pay to show your ad 1,000 times.

**Formula:** `(Total Spend ÷ Impressions) × 1,000`

| Rating | CPM | What It Means |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| 🔴 Bad | > $50 | Audience too narrow, competitive, or low relevance score. |
| 🟡 Average | $20 - $50 | Normal for B2B targeting professionals. |
| 🟢 Good | $10 - $20 | Efficient reach. Targeting working well. |
| 🌟 Excellent | < $10 | Rare for B2B. Broad targeting or low competition. |

**B2B Note:** Expect $15-45 CPM for professional audiences. C-suite targeting can hit $60-100+.

---

### CPA (Cost Per Acquisition/Action)
**What it is:** How much you pay for each desired action (lead, signup, etc.).

**Formula:** `Total Spend ÷ Number of Conversions`

| Rating | CPA (Lead Gen) | What It Means |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| 🔴 Bad | > $150 | Funnel broken, wrong audience, or weak offer. |
| 🟡 Average | $75 - $150 | Workable if lead quality is high. |
| 🟢 Good | $30 - $75 | Healthy for B2B lead gen. |
| 🌟 Excellent | < $30 | Crushing it. Scale this. |

**B2B Note:** CPA varies wildly by industry. Legal/finance: $100-300+. SaaS: $30-100. Local services: $15-50.

---

### ROAS (Return On Ad Spend)
**What it is:** Revenue generated for every dollar spent on ads.

**Formula:** `Revenue from Ads ÷ Ad Spend`

| Rating | ROAS | What It Means |
|--------|------|---------------|
| 🔴 Bad | < 1.0x | Losing money. Every $1 spent returns less than $1. |
| 🟡 Breakeven | 1.0x - 2.0x | Covering costs but not profitable after overhead. |
| 🟢 Good | 2.0x - 4.0x | Profitable. Healthy margin. |
| 🌟 Excellent | > 4.0x | Strong profit. Consider scaling aggressively. |

**B2B Note:** For lead gen, track blended ROAS (include close rate + LTV). A $100 lead that becomes a $10K client = 100x ROAS.

---

### CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
**What it is:** Total cost to acquire one paying customer (not just a lead).

**Formula:** `(Ad Spend + Sales Costs + Overhead) ÷ New Customers`

| Rating | CAC vs LTV | What It Means |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| 🔴 Bad | CAC > LTV | Unsustainable. Losing money per customer. |
| 🟡 Warning | CAC = 50-100% of LTV | Thin margins. Little room for error. |
| 🟢 Good | CAC = 20-33% of LTV | Healthy 3-5x LTV:CAC ratio. |
| 🌟 Excellent | CAC < 20% of LTV | 5x+ LTV:CAC. Scale hard. |

**B2B Benchmark:** Target 3:1 LTV:CAC ratio minimum. 5:1+ is excellent.

---

### Frequency
**What it is:** Average number of times each person saw your ad.

**Formula:** `Impressions ÷ Reach`

| Rating | Frequency | What It Means |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| 🟢 Optimal | 1.5 - 3.0 | Fresh exposure, building awareness. |
| 🟡 Watch | 3.0 - 5.0 | Repetition setting in. Monitor performance. |
| 🔴 Bad | > 5.0 | Ad fatigue. CTR drops, CPM rises. Refresh creative. |
| ⚠️ Too Low | < 1.5 | Not enough exposure for brand recall. |

**B2B Note:** B2B can tolerate higher frequency (5-7) because decision cycles are longer. But refresh creative every 2-3 weeks.

---

### ThruPlay
**What it is:** Video views where the user watched at least 15 seconds (or the whole video if <15 sec).

**Formula:** Native Meta metric for video completion.

| Rating | ThruPlay Rate | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| 🔴 Bad | < 15% | Video doesn't hook. First 3 seconds failing. |
| 🟡 Average | 15% - 25% | Decent but hook could improve. |
| 🟢 Good | 25% - 40% | Strong engagement. Content resonates. |
| 🌟 Excellent | > 40% | Exceptional. Retarget these viewers. |

**Cost Benchmark (ThruPlay campaigns):**
- Bad: > $0.15 per ThruPlay
- Good: $0.05 - $0.10 per ThruPlay
- Excellent: < $0.05 per ThruPlay

---

### Hook Rate
**What it is:** Percentage of people who watched past the first 3 seconds of your video.

**Formula:** `(3-Second Video Views ÷ Impressions) × 100`

| Rating | Hook Rate | What It Means |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| 🔴 Bad | < 20% | Scroll-stoppers not stopping scrolls. |
| 🟡 Average | 20% - 30% | Opening is okay but not grabbing attention. |
| 🟢 Good | 30% - 40% | Strong hook. People are curious. |
| 🌟 Excellent | > 40% | Killer opening. Study this for future ads. |

**Pro Tip:** If Hook Rate is high but ThruPlay is low → video loses people in the middle. If Hook Rate is low → fix your opening frame.

## B2B Lead Gen Specific Notes

1. **Quality > Quantity:** A $100 lead that closes at 20% beats a $30 lead that closes at 2%.

2. **Track downstream:** Connect Meta to your CRM. Know which campaigns produce *revenue*, not just leads.

3. **Longer attribution:** B2B sales cycles are 30-90+ days. Use longer attribution windows (7-day click, 1-day view minimum).

4. **Retargeting is gold:** ThruPlay and page visitor audiences convert 3-5x better than cold.

5. **Lead form vs. landing page:** Instant Forms get more leads but lower quality. Landing pages get fewer but better leads.
