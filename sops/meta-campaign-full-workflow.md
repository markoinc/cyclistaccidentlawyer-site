   - Media Type: Images and videos

---

## 2. Copy Creation

**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes

### Ad Copy Framework (PAS)
```
PROBLEM: Identify the pain point
AGITATE: Make it vivid, emotional
SOLUTION: Present your offer as the answer
CTA: Clear next step
```

### Copy Variations to Test
Create 3-5 variations per concept:

| Type | Description | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Direct** | Straight value prop | When offer is strong and clear |
| **Pain Point** | Lead with problem | When audience has acute pain |
| **Social Proof** | Lead with results | When you have impressive numbers |
| **Curiosity** | Hook with question | When testing cold audiences |
| **Comparison** | Us vs them | When differentiating from competitors |

### 📝 COPY TEMPLATES (Fill in the blanks)

#### Template 1: Pain Point Lead
```
[Specific frustration your audience feels]

Here's the truth:
[Why this problem exists / What makes it worse]

That's why we created [Your Offer Name].

[Benefit 1]
[Benefit 2]  
[Benefit 3]

[CTA - What they get + How to get it]

👇 [Action instruction]
```

**Example (MVA Lead Gen):**
```
Tired of paying $5,000+ for leads that never sign?

Here's the truth:
Most lead gen companies charge you whether the case signs or not. 
You carry all the risk while they cash your check.

That's why we created our Signed Case Program.

✅ Pay only for signed MVA cases
✅ $3,000 average cost per signed case
✅ 87% retention rate (we only send quality)

Get your first 2 cases with our risk-free trial.

👇 Book a 15-min call to see if we're a fit
```

#### Template 2: Social Proof Lead
```
[Impressive number/stat]

[Brief explanation of what this means]

[How you achieved this / What you offer]

[2-3 bullet benefits]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
```
200+ law firms trust us to deliver signed MVA cases.

Why? Because we only get paid when you get paid.

No retainers. No lead fees. Just signed cases delivered to your inbox.

✅ Average cost: $3,000 per signed case
✅ Pre-screened for liability and treatment
✅ Same-day delivery to your CRM

👇 See if you qualify for our next opening
```

#### Template 3: Question Hook
```
[Provocative question that stops scroll]

[Validate their experience]

[Introduce your solution]

[Proof/credibility]

[Offer + CTA]
```

**Example:**
```
What if you only paid for cases that actually signed?

If you're like most firms, you've spent thousands on:
❌ Leads that don't answer
❌ Cases that don't qualify
❌ "Prospects" who already hired someone

There's a better way.

We deliver signed MVA cases—you only pay after they sign.

200+ firms. 87% retention. $3k average per signed case.

👇 Book a call to see available inventory
```

### Copy Structure Rules

**Primary Text:**
- First 125 characters MUST hook (this is all they see before "See More")
- Total max: 500 characters
- Use line breaks for readability
- Emojis: Use sparingly (1-3 max), must be relevant

**Headline (40 characters max):**
✅ Good: "Signed MVA Cases from $3k"
✅ Good: "Stop Paying for Bad Leads"  
❌ Bad: "Click Here to Learn More" (generic)
❌ Bad: "The Best Legal Marketing Solution for Your Law Firm" (too long)

**Description (30 characters, optional):**
- Only shows on some placements
- Reinforces headline
- Examples: "Risk-free trial available" | "200+ firms trust us"

### ❌ Copy Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| No hook in first line | They'll scroll past | Put most compelling point first |
| Wall of text | Hard to read on mobile | Use line breaks every 1-2 sentences |
| Vague claims | "Best service" means nothing | Use specific numbers: "$3k per case" |
| Multiple CTAs | Confuses reader | One clear action per ad |
| ALL CAPS EVERYWHERE | Feels spammy, may get rejected | Use sparingly for ONE word max |
| Guaranteed results | Policy violation | Use "average" or "typical" |
| Mentioning Facebook | Policy violation | Never say "Facebook" in ad copy |

---

## 3. Creative Production

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours (depending on tools used)

### Creative Types (Priority Order)
1. **Static Images** - Fast to produce, easy to test (START HERE)
2. **Carousels** - Good for features/benefits list
3. **Video (UGC style)** - Highest engagement when done right
4. **Video (motion graphics)** - Good for explainers

### Static Image Specs

| Placement | Size (pixels) | Aspect Ratio | File Type |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Feed (Primary) | 1080 x 1080 | 1:1 (square) | JPG or PNG |
| Stories/Reels | 1080 x 1920 | 9:16 (vertical) | JPG or PNG |
| Right Column | 1200 x 628 | 1.91:1 (landscape) | JPG or PNG |

**💡 Pro Tip:** Create 1:1 (1080x1080) as your primary. Meta will auto-crop for other placements. Only create 9:16 separately if you're investing heavily in Stories/Reels.

**File Requirements:**
- Max file size: 30MB
- Recommended: Under 1MB for fast loading
- Format: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with text

### Image Creative Guidelines

**Must-Haves:**
- ✅ Eye-catching hero image (faces perform well)
- ✅ High contrast (stands out in feed)
- ✅ Readable on mobile (text large enough)
- ✅ Brand colors consistent
- ✅ Clear value prop visible

**Avoid:**
- ❌ More than 20% text (may reduce delivery)
- ❌ Small text (unreadable on mobile)
- ❌ Cluttered design (too many elements)
- ❌ Stock photos that look fake
- ❌ Before/after images (policy violation in many categories)

### Creating Images (Tool Options)

**Option 1: Canva (Easiest)**
1. Go to canva.com
2. Search "Facebook Ad" for templates
3. Choose 1080x1080 template
4. Customize with your branding
5. Download as PNG

**Option 2: Nano Banana (AI Image Generation)**
See: `nano-banana-image-generation.md`

**Option 3: Photoshop/Figma (Advanced)**
For custom designs requiring more control

### Video Specs

| Format | Recommended Length | Size | Aspect Ratio |
|--------|-------------------|------|--------------|
| Feed Video | 15-30 seconds | 1080x1080 or 1080x1350 | 1:1 or 4:5 |
| Stories/Reels | 15 seconds max | 1080x1920 | 9:16 |
| In-Stream | 5-15 seconds | 1280x720 | 16:9 |

**Video Technical Requirements:**
- Format: MP4 or MOV
- Max file size: 4GB
- Min resolution: 1080p
- Max length: 240 minutes (but keep under 60 sec for ads)

**Video Structure (15-30 sec):**
```
0-3 sec:  HOOK 👉 Stop the scroll (pattern interrupt, bold statement, question)
3-15 sec: VALUE 👉 Problem → Solution (why should they care?)
15-25 sec: PROOF 👉 Social proof, testimonial, results
25-30 sec: CTA 👉 Exactly what to do next
```

## 4. Campaign Setup in Meta Ads Manager

**Estimated Time:** 45-90 minutes (first time), 20-30 minutes (with practice)

### Step-by-Step Campaign Creation

#### Step 4.1: Access Ads Manager

1. Open browser, go to: **business.facebook.com/adsmanager**
2. Log in with your Facebook credentials
3. Select the correct **Ad Account** from the dropdown (top left, next to "Ads Manager")

**What You Should See:**
- Dashboard with "Campaigns," "Ad Sets," and "Ads" tabs
- Green "+ Create" button in the top left
- Your account name in the top left corner

**🛑 Troubleshooting: Can't Access Ads Manager?**
- "No ad account": Go to Business Settings → Ad Accounts → Create New
- "Account disabled": Check email for policy violation notice, submit appeal
- "Payment required": Go to Billing → Add payment method

---

#### Step 4.2: Create New Campaign

1. Click the green **"+ Create"** button (top left)
2. A popup appears: **"Create new campaign"**

**Choose Campaign Creation Method:**
- ⬜ **Advantage+ Campaigns** - Meta's AI handles most decisions (good for e-commerce)
- ✅ **Manual Campaign** - You control targeting, placements, etc. (RECOMMENDED for lead gen)

Click **"Continue"**

---

#### Step 4.3: Choose Campaign Objective

**Screen: "Choose a campaign objective"**

You'll see 6 options in boxes:

| Objective | When to Use | For MVA Lead Gen? |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Awareness** | Brand awareness, reach | ❌ No |
| **Traffic** | Website visits | ❌ No |
| **Engagement** | Likes, comments, shares | ❌ No |
| **Leads** | Form submissions, calls | ✅ YES - Use this |
| **App Promotion** | App installs | ❌ No |
| **Sales** | Purchases, high-intent conversions | ⚠️ Maybe (if pixel has purchase data) |

**For Lead Generation:** Click the **"Leads"** box → Click **"Continue"**

---

#### Step 4.4: Campaign Settings

**Screen: "Campaign name and settings"**

**Fill in:**

| Field | What to Enter | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Campaign name** | [Client]_[Objective]_[Date] | MVA_LeadGen_Feb2026 |
| **Special Ad Categories** | Select if applicable | Credit, Employment, Housing, Social/Political (Select "None" if not applicable) |

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Special Ad Categories**
If your ads relate to:
- Credit (loans, credit cards)
- Employment (job ads)
- Housing (real estate)
- Social Issues, Elections, or Politics

You MUST declare this. Failure to do so = account ban.

**For most B2B/lead gen: Select "None"**

---

**Buying Type:**
- ✅ **Auction** (default) - You compete in real-time auction
- ⬜ Reservation - For guaranteed reach (requires sales rep)

Keep **Auction** selected.

---

**Campaign Budget Optimization (Advantage Campaign Budget):**

Toggle: **ON** ✅ (Recommended)

This lets Meta automatically distribute budget to best-performing ad sets.

| Field | Recommendation | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| **Campaign budget** | Daily budget | Easier to control spend |
| **Amount** | $30-100/day minimum | Less = slower learning, may never optimize |

**💡 Budget Guidance:**
- Testing new audiences: $30-50/day
- Proven campaigns scaling: $100-500/day
- Minimum viable: $20/day (but learning will be slow)

---

**Bid Strategy:**
- ✅ **Highest volume** (formerly "Lowest cost") - Get most results for budget
- ⬜ Cost per result goal - Set max CPA (use only after you know your CPA)
- ⬜ Bid cap - Advanced (not recommended for beginners)

**Start with "Highest volume"** until you have conversion data.

---

Click **"Next"** to proceed to Ad Set.

---

#### Step 4.5: Ad Set Settings

**Screen: "Ad set" configuration**

**Ad Set Name:**
Format: [Audience]_[Targeting]_[Placement]
Example: `Lawyers_BroadUS_Advantage`

---

**Conversion Location (Where conversions happen):**

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Website** | Lead form is on your website | ✅ Most common |
| **Instant Forms** | Use Meta's native lead form | Good for mobile |
| **Messenger** | Leads via chat | For high-touch sales |
| **Instagram** | IG-specific lead forms | Rarely used |
| **Calls** | Phone calls | For call-only businesses |

**For website lead gen:** Select **"Website"**

---

**Performance Goal:**
- Select: **"Maximize number of conversions"**
- Conversion event: **"Lead"** (or whatever your form submission event is named)

**🛑 Don't see "Lead" as an option?**
Your pixel hasn't recorded any Lead events yet. Options:
1. Set up the pixel properly (Section 5)
2. Use "Landing page views" temporarily until you get lead data
3. Use Instant Forms instead

---

**Budget & Schedule (if not using Campaign Budget Optimization):**

| Field | Setting |
|-------|---------|
| Daily budget | Your amount (e.g., $50) |

Leave this blank. Let Meta's algorithm find the best audience.
✅ Works well with enough budget ($50+/day)

**Option B: Interest-Based Targeting**
Click "Browse" or type interests:

For B2B (Lawyers):

- Behaviors: Business page admins

2. Sort by "Cost per result" (lowest first)
3. Identify:
   - 🏆 Winners: Below target CPA
   - ⚠️ Borderline: At target CPA
   - ❌ Losers: Above target CPA

**Step 2: Take Action**

| Performance | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| CPA < 50% of target | Increase budget 20-30% |
| CPA at target | Keep running, monitor |
| CPA 1.5-2x target | Give it 2 more days if new |
| CPA > 2x target | Pause it |
| CTR < 0.5% | Creative isn't working, pause |
| Frequency > 3 | Audience fatigue, refresh creative |

**Step 3: Launch New Tests**
- Add new creative variations
- Test new copy angles
- Expand or refine audience

### Understanding Learning Phase

**What is it?**
Meta needs ~50 conversions per week per ad set to optimize effectively.

**Learning Status:**
| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Learning | Gathering data | Normal, wait |
| Learning Limited | Not enough conversions | Increase budget, broaden targeting, combine ad sets |
| Active | Optimized | Good! Monitor only |

**How to Exit Learning Faster:**
- Higher daily budget ($50+/day per ad set)
- Broader audience (less restrictions)
- Optimize for more frequent event (if possible)
- Combine small ad sets into one

### Reporting Metrics Reference

| Metric | Target | What It Means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** | > 1% | % of people who click after seeing ad |
| **CPC (Cost Per Click)** | < $3 | How much each click costs |
| **CPM (Cost Per 1000 Impressions)** | $10-30 | How much to reach 1000 people |
| **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)** | Varies | Your cost per lead/conversion |
| **Frequency** | < 3 | Average times each person saw your ad |
| **ROAS** | > 3x | Return on ad spend (for revenue tracking) |

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Ad Rejections

**Where to Check:**
Ads Manager → Click rejected ad → "Delivery" column → Hover for reason

**Common Rejection Reasons:**

| Reason | What It Means | How to Fix |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Personal attributes** | Ad implies personal characteristics | Remove "you" statements like "Are you overweight?" |
| **Misleading claims** | Unsubstantiated promises | Add "results may vary", remove guarantees |
| **Landing page issues** | LP doesn't match ad or is broken | Ensure LP is live, matches ad content |
| **Prohibited content** | Violates advertising policies | Review Meta's ad policies, remove violating content |
| **Special category violation** | Didn't declare housing/credit/employment | Edit campaign, select correct special category |
| **Text in image** | >20% text in image | Reduce text overlay (Meta relaxed this but still matters) |

**Appeal Process:**
1. Click "Request Review" on rejected ad
2. Write brief explanation
3. Wait 24-48 hours
4. If denied again, create new ad following policies

---

### Low/No Delivery

**Check in this order:**

| Check | How | Fix |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **Ad approved?** | Delivery column shows "Active" | Wait for review or fix rejection |
| **Budget too low?** | Is daily budget < $10? | Increase to $20+ minimum |
| **Audience too small?** | Check "Potential Reach" in ad set | Broaden targeting |
| **Bid too low?** | Using bid cap? | Switch to "Highest volume" |
| **Schedule issue?** | Check start/end dates | Verify campaign is scheduled to run now |
| **Account issue?** | Check for notifications | Review account status, payment method |

---

### High CPA (Cost Per Lead)

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Is your landing page converting? (Check LP conversion rate independently)
2. Is your offer compelling?
3. Is the audience right?
4. Is creative resonating? (Check CTR)

**Fixes:**

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| High CTR, high CPA | LP not converting | Improve landing page |
| Low CTR, high CPA | Ad not compelling | New creative/copy |
| High CPM, high CPA | Expensive audience | Broaden targeting |
| Normal metrics, high CPA | Market reality | Test different offer |

---

### Learning Limited

**Causes:**
- Budget too low for conversion volume
- Audience too narrow
- Too many ad sets splitting budget
- Optimizing for rare event

**Fixes:**
1. Increase budget (need ~50 conversions/week)
2. Combine multiple ad sets into one
3. Broaden targeting
4. Optimize for earlier funnel event (e.g., landing page view instead of lead)

---

### Account Disabled

**Immediate Steps:**
1. Check email for notification explaining why
2. Go to Account Quality: business.facebook.com/accountquality
3. Review specific violations listed
4. Click "Request Review" if you believe it's an error

**Prevention:**
- Never make medical/legal claims without disclaimers
- Always declare special ad categories
- Don't use engagement bait
- Don't change landing pages drastically after approval
- Keep payment method valid

## 9. Creative Refresh Cadence

| Creative Type | Refresh Frequency | Signs It's Time |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Static Images | Every 2-4 weeks | CTR dropping, frequency > 3 |
| Video | Every 3-6 weeks | Engagement dropping |
| Copy | Every 2-3 weeks | CTR declining |

### Signs Creative Needs Refresh
- CTR dropping week-over-week
- Frequency > 3 (prospecting) or > 6 (retargeting)
- CPM increasing without market changes
- Comments: "I keep seeing this ad"
- Engagement (likes, comments) declining

### Creative Testing Framework
Always have in rotation:
- 2-3 "control" ads (proven performers)
- 2-3 "test" ads (new variations)

Kill tests that underperform controls after sufficient data (~1000 impressions, 3+ days).
