## DISCOVERY CALL FRAMEWORK

### The 5-Part Discovery Framework

*(Source: "How To Sell AI Automations - Discovery Calls 2026")*

```
1. INTRODUCTION → Set the stage (2-3 min)
2. GOALS → Where are they trying to go? (5-7 min)
3. SITUATION → What's actually happening now? (5-7 min)
4. PROBLEM & IMPLICATIONS → What's not working + cost (10-15 min)
5. NEEDS PAYOFF → If we solved this, what changes? (5 min)
```

### Introduction Phase

**What to Do:**
- Thank them for their time
- Quick background on yourself (30 seconds max)
- Set expectations for the call

**Script:**
> "Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time. Quick background - I'm [Your Name], I help [type of business] achieve [outcome] through [service]. The purpose of today is to understand what's going on in your business, see if we can help, and if it makes sense, discuss next steps. Sound good?"

### Goals Phase

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- "Where are you trying to go in the next 6-12 months?"
- "What does success look like for you?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would your business look like?"
- "What's the ONE thing that would make the biggest difference?"

> "Understanding their goals lets you position your solution as the bridge from where they are to where they want to be." *(Source: Discovery calls video)*

### Situation Phase

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- "Walk me through your current process for [X]."
- "What tools/systems are you using right now?"
- "How is that working for you?"
- "What does a typical week/month look like?"
- "Who's currently handling [X] on your team?"

### Problem & Implications Phase (MOST IMPORTANT)

**Digging Into Problems:**
- "What's the biggest challenge you're facing with [X]?"
- "How long has this been going on?"
- "What have you tried to fix it?"
- "Why do you think those solutions didn't work?"

**Quantifying the Problem (CRITICAL):**
> "When you put actual numbers to the problem, it changes the conversation. Suddenly it's not abstract anymore." *(Source: Discovery calls 2026)*

**Quantification Questions:**
- "How many hours a week is this taking you/your team?"
- "What's that costing you in terms of revenue?"
- "How much revenue are you leaving on the table?"
- "What's your cost per lead/ticket/acquisition right now?"
- "If this continues for another year, what does that look like?"

**Example Quantification:**
```
Problem: Spending too much time on manual tasks
Hours/week: 20 hours
Hourly rate: $100 (opportunity cost)
Weekly cost: $2,000
Annual cost: $104,000

Now you can say: "So this is essentially a $104,000 problem..."
```

### Needs Payoff Phase

**Key Questions:**
- "If we solved this, what would that change for you?"
- "What would it mean to your business if [problem] was gone?"
- "What would you do with those extra hours/that revenue?"

> "When they say the outcome out loud, it becomes real. They're selling themselves." *(Source: Discovery framework video)*

## OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### The 5-Step Objection Handling Framework

*(Source: "How to DESTROY Any Sales Objection")*

```
1. LISTEN → Don't interrupt, let them finish
2. ACKNOWLEDGE → "I totally understand..."
3. CLARIFY → "Just so I'm clear, is it [X] or [Y]?"
4. RESPOND → Address the REAL objection
5. CONFIRM → "Does that make sense? Any other concerns?"
```

### Common Objections & Scripts

#### "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
> "Totally understand. Most people want to think things through. Can I ask - what specifically are you wanting to think about? Is it the timing, the investment, or something about what we offer?"

**Alternative (Yes/No/Maybe Frame):**
> "I hear you. Here's the thing - at the end of this, there's really only three answers: Hell yes, no, or maybe. I'm 100% okay with a no - we're both adults. What I want to avoid is the in-between, because that usually means no anyway. So can we keep it between a yes or a no?"

*(Source: $10M Closer high-ticket training)*

#### "It's too expensive" / "I don't have the money"

**Response 1 (Reframe to value):**
> "I understand, it's a real investment. Can I ask - is it that you don't see the value, or that you see the value but can't access the funds right now?"

**Response 2 (Cost of inaction):**
> "Totally get it. Quick question though - you mentioned this problem is costing you [X] per month. If you don't solve it, where does that put you in 12 months? Is doing nothing really the cheaper option?"

**Response 3 (Split it up):**
> "I hear you on that. Is it the total amount, or is it more about cash flow? Because we do have payment options that could work better for your situation."

#### "I need to talk to my partner/spouse/business partner"

**Response:**
> "Of course, makes sense. A couple questions - is this something you'd both be making the decision on, or is one of you typically the final say? And if they weren't in the picture, based on what we've discussed, would YOU be ready to move forward?"

**Pre-handle (ask early in the call):**
> "By the way, before we go further - is there anyone else who needs to be on this call to make a decision? A business partner, spouse, anyone? I want to make sure we're efficient with everyone's time."

#### "I've been burned before"

**Response:**
> "I really appreciate you sharing that, and I'm sorry you had that experience. Can I ask - what specifically happened? And what would need to be different this time for you to feel confident moving forward?"

#### "I'm not the decision-maker"

**Response:**
> "Got it. Who is the decision-maker, and what would need to happen for them to be on our next call? Better yet, is there any way we could loop them in now for the last few minutes?"

#### "Can you send me more information?"

**Response:**
> "Absolutely, I can send information. But honestly, anything I send you is what we just covered. What specific questions do you have that I can answer right now while we're here? Usually the 'send info' request means there's something you're still unsure about."

#### "The timing isn't right"

**Response:**
> "Totally understand. Let me ask - what would need to change for the timing to be right? Is it a resource thing, a priority thing, or something else? Because usually when someone says timing, there's a specific blocker I might be able to help with."

### The Objection Behind the Objection

> "The first objection is almost never the real objection. Dig deeper. 'I need to think about it' usually means 'I'm afraid' or 'I'm not convinced.' Find the real reason." *(Source: Objection handling video)*

**Pizza Analogy:**
> "If I ask you to get pizza and you say 'I'm not hungry,' I could give up. Or I could ask: 'Not hungry for pizza, or not hungry at all? When did you last eat?' Turns out you're on a diet and would eat a salad. The objection wasn't hunger - it was dietary preference." *(Source: Sales objection video)*

## CLOSING TECHNIQUES

### The One-Call Close Structure

*(Source: "$10M Closer High-Ticket Training")*

```
1. Pleasantries (2 min)
2. Pre-call prep check (2 min)
3. Pre-qualify red flags (3 min)
4. Set frame/agenda (2 min)
5. Discovery (15-20 min)
6. Transition + closing questions (5 min)
7. Pitch using PFS framework (10 min)
8. Close (5-10 min)
```

### Pre-Closing Questions (Transition Phase)

**These go BEFORE you pitch:**

1. **Commitment Close:**
   > "Just like hiring a personal trainer - they can create the meal plan and workouts, but you still need to show up. Is this something you're committed to?"

2. **Decision-Maker Close:**
   > "Is there anyone else who needs to be involved in making this decision?"

3. **Timing Close:**
   > "How much time do you have to dedicate to this weekly?"

4. **Financial Close:**
   > "How much have you set aside to invest in solving this problem?"

5. **Ready-to-Move Close:**
   > "If we can help you achieve [goal] and solve [problem], would you be ready to move forward today?"

### The PFS Pitch Framework

*(Source: High-ticket sales training)*

**For each pillar of your offer, follow:**
```
P - PROBLEM: "You mentioned [specific problem they said]..."
F - FEATURE: "What we do is [feature of your solution]..."
S - SOLUTION: "Which means you'll [outcome/benefit]..."
```

**Example:**
> "You mentioned you're spending 20 hours a week on manual lead follow-up (PROBLEM). What we do is set up automated sequences that nurture leads 24/7 (FEATURE). Which means you get those 20 hours back AND leads get faster responses, so you close more deals (SOLUTION). Does that make sense?"

**After Each Pillar:**
- "Does that make sense?"
- "Do you feel like that would help?"
- "Any questions on that?"

### Closing Scripts

**The Simple Close:**
> "So based on everything we discussed, I think we can definitely help you. The investment is [price]. Are you ready to get started?"

**The Assumptive Close:**
> "Great, so the next step is to get you onboarded. I'll send over the agreement and we can get started as early as this week. Do you prefer email or should I send it to you directly here?"

**The Choice Close:**
> "You have two options: the [Package A] at [price] or the [Package B] at [price]. Which feels like the better fit for where you are right now?"

**The Summary Close:**
> "So to recap: you're currently [problem], which is costing you [quantified impact]. What we'll do is [solution], which will get you to [goal]. The investment is [price]. If you're ready, let's do this."

### After They Say Yes

> "Don't celebrate. Stay calm, professional, and move swiftly (not quickly) into onboarding. 'Perfect. Let me get you logged in. What email should I use?'" *(Source: Closing techniques video)*

**Process:**
1. Collect payment (immediately)
2. Send confirmation/receipt
3. Send onboarding materials
4. Schedule next step/kickoff call
5. Thank them and express excitement

## HIGH-TICKET SALES PSYCHOLOGY

### Three Types of Buyers

*(Source: $10M Closer training)*

| Type | % of Prospects | Characteristics | How to Handle |
|------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Buyers in Heat** | 20% | Ready to buy, just have questions | Don't mess it up - answer questions and close |
| **Buyers in Power** | 60% | Interested but need convincing | Full sales call, discovery, pitch, close |
| **Tire Kickers** | 20% | Not serious, wasting time | Disqualify quickly and move on |

**How to Identify Within 5 Minutes:**
- Ask: "What was your motivation for booking this call?"
- Ask: "What are you looking for help with?"

**If tire kicker:**
> "Hey, this call is really for people who are serious about [outcome]. It sounds like you're just exploring. How about you check out [resource] and when you're ready to actually move forward, book another call?"

### Mindset Principles

**"Life is easy, don't make it difficult."**
> "Frame everything as achievable. Your belief transfers to the prospect. If you think selling is hard, it will be." *(Source: High-ticket sales mindset)*

**"Fight back."**
> "When faced with objections, obstacles, or fear - fight back. That's the only response. The call you're on, the objection you're handling, this is your version of fighting back."

### Trust-Building Principles

**Seek to Understand, Not to Be Heard:**
> "Prospects don't care about your relatable statements. They want to feel heard. Ask second and third layer questions instead of talking." *(Source: Objection handling video)*

**Ask Questions, Make Fewer Statements:**
> "If you attach fluff to your questions, you get fluff answers. Be short, concise, straight to the point."

**Example:**
- ❌ "That's awesome! $10K/month is a great goal, we have so many clients who hit that! How long have you wanted to make $10K/month?"
- ✅ "Why $10,000 a month?" (pause, let them answer)

### Tonality and Pace

> "People trust people who speak slower and more coherently. Slow down, especially when closing. Commission breath kills deals." *(Source: Sales psychology video)*

**High-Trust Behaviors:**
- Speak 10-20% slower than normal conversation
- Pause after important questions (let silence work)
- Lower pitch slightly at end of statements (authority)
- Match their energy level (mirroring)

---

## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCES

### The "No Decision" Follow-Up

**Day 0 (Same day, after call):**
> "Hey [Name], it was great chatting today. I've attached [relevant resource] we discussed. Let me know if any questions come up. Looking forward to next steps!"

**Day 2:**
> "Hey [Name], just following up on our conversation. Any thoughts since we spoke? Happy to jump on a quick call to address anything."

**Day 5:**
> "Hi [Name], wanted to check in. I know [problem they mentioned] is costing you [quantified amount]. Is that still a priority to solve?"

**Day 7:**
> "Hey [Name], I'm closing out my pipeline for this week. Before I mark you as 'not interested right now,' wanted to give you one more chance to move forward. What's holding you back?"

**Day 14 (Final):**
> "Hi [Name], haven't heard back so I'll assume timing isn't right. I'll reach back in 30 days. In the meantime, here's [value piece]. Best of luck with [their goal]."

### Warm Outreach Script

*(Source: Alex Hormozi lead gen strategy)*

**Phone Script:**
1. **Open:** "Hey [Name], what's up! How's it going?"
2. **Catch-up:** Let them share what's new (1-2 min)
3. **Transition:** "Quick question for you..."
4. **Ask:** "Is anyone helping you with [problem you solve]?"
5. **Offer:** "I'm working with a few people and in exchange for a referral and review, I'll [deliver value] for free/discount."
6. **Referral:** "Do you know anyone else who might need this?"
7. **Close:** "I'll text you the details. And can you do a three-way intro to those other folks?"

### Multi-Channel Follow-Up

| Day | Channel | Message Type |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| 0 | Email | Thank you + recap |
| 1 | SMS | Quick check-in |
| 3 | Call | Voice follow-up |
| 5 | Email | Value add (case study/resource) |
| 7 | SMS | Final reminder |
| 14 | Email | Breakup email |
| 30 | Email | Re-engagement (new angle) |

## QUALIFICATION FRAMEWORKS

### BANT Framework

| Letter | Question | What You're Looking For |
|--------|----------|------------------------|
| **B** | Budget | "How much have you set aside to solve this?" |
| **A** | Authority | "Who else is involved in this decision?" |
| **N** | Need | "What's the #1 problem you need to solve?" |
| **T** | Timeline | "When do you need this solved by?" |

### Disqualification Red Flags

**Disqualify if:**
- No budget and no way to access funds
- Not the decision-maker and can't get them on call
- No clear problem or need
- Timeline is "someday" or "maybe next year"
- Multiple failed solutions with no self-awareness

**How to Disqualify Gracefully:**
> "Based on what you've shared, I don't think we're the right fit for you right now. Here's what I'd recommend instead: [alternative/free resource]. When [X changes], feel free to reach back out."

### Pre-Qualification Questions (First 5 Minutes)

1. "Did you watch the video we sent before the call?"
2. "What's your motivation for booking this call?"
3. "What are you looking for help with regarding [topic]?"
4. "Is there anyone else who should be on this call?"
5. "What have you already tried to solve this?"

### Financial Pre-Qualification (Subtle)

> "Don't wait until minute 45 to find out they can't afford it. Frame it as 'application questions.'" *(Source: High-ticket training)*

**Script:**
> "Cool, before we go further, I have a couple quick questions just to make sure we're a fit. [Question about experience/situation]. And for [service], it does require investment - how much do you have set aside for solving this problem?"

---

## SALES CALL STRUCTURE

### The 6-Part One-Call Close

*(Source: $10M Closer framework)*

#### Part 1: Intro & Rapport (2-3 min)

**Script:**
> "Hey [Name], nice to meet you! How's your day going? [Response] Cool. And where are you calling from? [Response] Nice. Well, we have about 45 minutes here - do you mind if we jump into the purpose of the call?"

**Key Rules:**
- Keep pleasantries SHORT (2-3 min max)
- Only ask 3 questions: How's your day? Where are you from? Ready to dive in?
- Never ask about the weather (low-value)

#### Part 2: Pre-Call Prep Check (2 min)

**Script:**
> "By the way, we sent over that video with [person] explaining what we do. Did you have a chance to watch it?"

**If no:**
- Check what they know: "How much do you know about what we do?"
- If very little: Reschedule with instruction to watch video
- If moderate: Proceed but be prepared to explain more

#### Part 3: Set Frame & Agenda (2 min)

**Script:**
> "Perfect. So just so you know how this call will go - I'm going to ask some questions to understand your situation and see if we're a good fit. If we are, I'll explain how we can help and we'll get you onboarded by the end of the call. If we're not a fit, I'll tell you that too. Sound good?"

**Key:** Always establish that they'll be making a decision TODAY.

#### Part 4: Discovery (15-20 min)

- Goals → Where do they want to go?
- Situation → Where are they now?
- Problem → What's not working?
- Implications → What's the cost of not solving it?
- Needs Payoff → What would solving it mean?

**Rules:**
- More questions, fewer statements
- Dig into second and third layers
- Quantify the problem with real numbers

#### Part 5: Transition & Pre-Closes (5 min)

**Script:**
> "Okay, I don't really have many more questions. Is there anything else I should know that you didn't mention?"

**Then ask closing questions:**
- Commitment pre-handle
- Time availability pre-handle  
- Financial pre-handle
- Partner pre-handle
- Ready-to-move question

#### Part 6: Pitch, Price & Close (10-15 min)

**Permission to Proceed:**
> "So I definitely think we can help you with [problem] and get you to [goal]. Do you mind if I break down exactly how?"

**Pitch using PFS (3 pillars):**
- Problem → Feature → Solution (Pillar 1)
- Problem → Feature → Solution (Pillar 2)
- Problem → Feature → Solution (Pillar 3)

**After each:** "Does that make sense? Do you have questions?"

**Price Drop:**
> "So that's everything. The investment is [price]. Based on everything we talked about, are you ready to get started?"

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Discovery Mistakes

1. **❌ Talking more than listening**
   - ✓ 70% listening, 30% talking ratio
   - "The person asking questions controls the conversation."

2. **❌ Giving statements instead of asking questions**
   - ✓ Cut the fluff, ask direct questions
   - ❌ "That's a great goal, everyone wants that..."
   - ✓ "Why specifically $10K/month?"

3. **❌ Not quantifying the problem**
   - ✓ Always put numbers to pain
   - Hours lost, revenue missed, costs incurred

4. **❌ Accepting surface-level answers**
   - ✓ Ask second and third layer follow-ups
   - "Tell me more about that..."
   - "What do you mean by that specifically?"

### Closing Mistakes

1. **❌ Commission breath (speeding up at close)**
   - ✓ Slow down and stay calm when asking for money
   - "Your pace should be slower at the close than anywhere else."

2. **❌ Waiting until end to handle objections**
   - ✓ Pre-handle throughout the call
   - Ask about partner, money, time BEFORE pitching

3. **❌ Pitching before discovery is complete**
   - ✓ Never pitch until you fully understand their situation
   - "How can you solve a problem you don't understand?"

4. **❌ Not asking for the sale**
   - ✓ Directly ask: "Are you ready to get started?"
   - Don't just trail off and hope they buy

5. **❌ Handling questions after price drop**
   - ✓ Exhaust all questions BEFORE revealing price
   - "Did you have any other questions before I share the investment?"

### Follow-Up Mistakes

1. **❌ Not following up at all**
   - ✓ 80% of sales happen after 5+ touchpoints

2. **❌ Just "checking in"**
   - ✓ Every follow-up should add value
   - Share case study, resource, new insight

3. **❌ Giving up after 1-2 attempts**
   - ✓ Follow up 5-7 times minimum
   - The fortune is in the follow-up

### Mindset Mistakes

1. **❌ Taking rejection personally**
   - ✓ "Every no brings you closer to a yes."

2. **❌ Being attached to the outcome**
   - ✓ Focus on helping, not on closing
   - Desperation repels buyers

3. **❌ Not preparing for calls**
   - ✓ Research the prospect before the call
   - Review notes, understand their business

## LEAD GENERATION STRATEGIES

### Alex Hormozi's Core Four

*(Source: Alex Hormozi lead gen strategy)*

1. **Warm Outreach** - People who know you, one-on-one
2. **Cold Outreach** - Strangers, one-on-one at scale
3. **Content** - One-to-many, organic reach
4. **Paid Ads** - One-to-many, paid reach

### Warm Outreach Framework

**The Phone Script:**
> 1. "Hey [Name], what's up?"
> 2. Let them catch you up on life
> 3. "Quick question for you..."
> 4. "Is anyone helping you with [your service]?"
> 5. "I'm starting this thing where I help [type of person] with [result]. In exchange for a referral and review, I'll do it for free/discounted."
> 6. "Do you know anyone else who might need this?"
> 7. "Cool, I'll text you details. Can you intro me to those folks?"

### Cold Outreach Formula

**The Three Problems to Solve:**
1. How do I find people to contact? (Build/buy lists)
2. What do I say? (Personalization + value)
3. How do I reach enough people? (Volume + automation)

**Cold Email Structure:**
```
[Personalized line about their business]

I help [type of business] [achieve result].

[Proof: numbers, testimonials, or credentials]

Would you be interested in [free value offer]?

[Your name]
```

### Content Strategy

*(Source: Hormozi content approach)*

**Content Types:**
- **Short-form:** Top of funnel, high volume, polarizing hooks
- **Long-form:** Deep education, builds trust over time
- **Pre-selling content:** Addresses objections before the call
- **Social proof content:** Testimonials, case studies, results

> "I used to be anti-content until I saw what brand building did for conversions. Content is the lubricant for everything else." *(Source: Lead gen strategy video)*

### The Irresistible Offer Formula

*(Source: Alex Hormozi $100M Offers)*

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) 
        ÷ (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)

Translation:
- Maximize the outcome they want
- Maximize their belief they'll get it
- Minimize how long it takes
- Minimize how hard it is for them
```

**Offer Example:**
> "Get 30% more conversions with an AI chatbot that sells for you 24/7 without lifting a finger. Fully live in 7 days. We build, train, and optimize - you just watch it work."

---

## ADVANCED TACTICS

### The Self-Reinforcing System

> "Don't just get customers. Get customers, get results, get reviews, get referrals. Let that bring more customers without extra work." *(Source: Hormozi philosophy)*

**The Loop:**
1. Get customers
2. Deliver results
3. Ask for reviews
4. Ask for referrals
5. Display reviews everywhere
6. Use referrals to get more customers
7. Repeat

### Rule of Reciprocity

> "Offer free stuff that others charge for. People feel like they owe you and are more likely to buy." *(Source: Lead gen strategy)*

**How to Apply:**
- Give away your best content for free
- Offer free audits/strategy sessions
- Provide value before asking for anything

### Extreme Ownership

> "If you're not getting leads or closing deals, don't blame the market, the economy, or your leads. Point the finger at yourself first. What can YOU do better?" *(Source: Hormozi philosophy)*

### 2026 Sales Year Power Moves

*(Source: 5 Power Moves for 2026 Sales)*

1. **Declare Your North Star**
   - Create a personal guiding statement for the year
   - "This is the year I become unshakably consistent."

2. **Manage Your Energy, Not Just Time**
   - What fueled you last year? What drained you?
   - Protect your most energized hours

3. **Master One Skill Deeply**
   - Pick ONE skill per quarter (discovery, closing, follow-up)
   - Go deep instead of spreading thin

4. **Build in Strategic Breaks**
   - Recovery is part of performance
   - Weekly quiet hour, monthly no-tech day, quarterly retreat

5. **Start Now, Not January 1st**
   - Momentum beats preparation
   - Make the first move today

### AI in Sales (2026 Perspective)

*(Source: Discovery Calls 2026)*

> "AI can do a lot, but that makes sales conversations tricky. When someone asks what you do and you say 'I help with AI,' it's vague. Anchor around their priorities - what metrics matter? What moves the needle right now?"

**AI Selling Framework:**
1. Identify their top priorities
2. Understand what metrics matter to them
3. Get specific about what to build first
4. Talk about clear path to results, not AI in general

---

## QUICK REFERENCE SCRIPTS

### Opening the Call
> "Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time. Quick background - I'm [Name], I help [target] achieve [result]. Today's about understanding your situation and seeing if we can help. Sound good?"

### Setting the Agenda
> "Here's how this works: I'll ask some questions, and if we're a fit, I'll explain how we help and we'll get you started today. If not, I'll tell you that too. Fair?"

### Transitioning to Close
> "I don't have any more questions. Before I explain how we can help, is there anything else I should know?"

### Asking for the Sale
> "The investment is [price]. Based on everything we discussed, are you ready to get started?"

### Handling "I need to think"
> "Totally understand. What specifically do you need to think about - the investment, the timing, or whether this is right for you?"

### The Yes/No/Maybe Frame
> "At the end of this, there's really only three things you can say: Hell yes, no, or maybe. I'm totally okay with a no. What I want to avoid is the in-between, because that's usually a nice way of saying no. Can we keep it between yes or no?"

### Breakup Message
> "Hey [Name], I haven't heard back so I'll assume timing isn't right. I'll follow up in 30 days. In the meantime, here's [resource]. Best of luck with [their goal]."

## EXPERT QUOTES & INSIGHTS

> "Discovery calls aren't about pitching. They're about understanding what the person is struggling with, what would make their life easier, and if you can genuinely help them. When you get that right, everything else becomes easier." *(Source: Discovery Calls 2026)*

> "Most sales training is backwards. They give you the scripts but don't teach you how to actually use them. Scripts are the fish - you need to learn to use the rod." *(Source: $10M Closer training)*

> "The more effective you ask questions, the more you proactively uncover objections upfront rather than reactively getting them at the end." *(Source: Objection handling video)*

> "Human beings are more good than bad. People want to stick to their word. Get commitments throughout the call, and closing becomes natural." *(Source: High-ticket sales training)*

> "If you're not getting customers, don't blame the market. Extreme ownership means pointing the finger at yourself first." *(Source: Hormozi philosophy)*

> "The highest percentage of sales across any market comes from word of mouth. Reviews and referrals aren't optional - they're mandatory." *(Source: Lead gen strategy)*

> "You don't drift into a great year. You design a great year." *(Source: 2026 Sales Power Moves)*
