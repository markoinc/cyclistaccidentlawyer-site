## SIMULATION: WHERE EACH PROSPECT GOES

### Stage 1: Ad/Discovery → Engagement (Do they even respond?)

| Offer | A (150) | B (350) | C (200) | D (100) | E (200) | Total Engaged |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **🟢 Marko** | 120 (80%) | 245 (70%) | 120 (60%) | 90 (90%) | 60 (30%) | **635** |
| 🔴 Rankings.io | 75 (50%) | 35 (10%) | 140 (70%) | 50 (50%) | 10 (5%) | **310** |
| 🟠 Scorpion | 30 (20%) | 175 (50%) | 140 (70%) | 40 (40%) | 80 (40%) | **465** |
| 🟡 MeanPug | 60 (40%) | 35 (10%) | 120 (60%) | 30 (30%) | 10 (5%) | **255** |
| 🔵 LawRank | 75 (50%) | 105 (30%) | 100 (50%) | 40 (40%) | 20 (10%) | **340** |
| 🟣 Grow Law | 60 (40%) | 175 (50%) | 80 (40%) | 30 (30%) | 40 (20%) | **385** |
| ⚪ DIY/Nothing | 150 (100%) | 350 (100%) | 200 (100%) | 100 (100%) | 200 (100%) | **1000** |

**Why Marko wins engagement:**
- AI Visibility Score is novel + interactive (highest CTR)
- Instant gratification (score in 10 seconds vs "book a consultation")
- Low barrier (just enter your URL vs "tell us your budget")
- AI angle attracts tech-forward AND scared prospects
- Rankings.io and MeanPug barely reach small firms (pricing/positioning too premium)
- Scorpion's brand is damaged with Escapees (20% engagement from that segment)

### Stage 2: Engagement → Qualified Lead (Do they book a call?)

| Offer | Engaged | Book Call | Booking Rate |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **🟢 Marko** | 635 | 165 | **26%** |
| 🔴 Rankings.io | 310 | 62 | 20% |
| 🟠 Scorpion | 465 | 116 | 25% |
| 🟡 MeanPug | 255 | 51 | 20% |
| 🔵 LawRank | 340 | 68 | 20% |
| 🟣 Grow Law | 385 | 77 | 20% |
| ⚪ DIY/Nothing | 1000 | 0 | 0% |

**Why Marko converts to calls:**
- The instant score creates urgency ("23/100?! I need to fix this")
- The detailed email audit arriving 30-60 min later is a second trigger
- "See your new homepage before you pay" is irresistible
- Every competitor just says "book a free consultation" — generic

### Stage 3: Qualified Lead → Show Rate (Do they actually show up?)

| Offer | Booked | Showed | Show Rate |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **🟢 Marko** | 165 | 119 | **72%** |
| 🔴 Rankings.io | 62 | 50 | 80% |
| 🟠 Scorpion | 116 | 81 | 70% |
| 🟡 MeanPug | 51 | 41 | 80% |
| 🔵 LawRank | 68 | 51 | 75% |
| 🟣 Grow Law | 77 | 54 | 70% |

**Notes:**
- Rankings.io and MeanPug have highest show rates because their prospects are pre-qualified by price (only serious buyers inquire at $50K+)
- Marko's 72% is strong because the audit email keeps them warm between booking and call
- Scorpion's 70% includes a lot of BDR-pushed appointments (lower intent)

### Stage 4: Show → Close (Do they buy?)

| Offer | Showed | Closed | Close Rate | Why |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|-----|
| **🟢 Marko** | 119 | **52** | **44%** | One-page preview + audit + guarantee + ownership + no contract = stacked value |
| 🔴 Rankings.io | 50 | 15 | 30% | Premium, proven, but sticker shock at $50K-$200K/yr. Many "let me think about it" |
| 🟠 Scorpion | 81 | 24 | 30% | Polished pitch but lock-in concerns + price. BDR-pushed leads = lower intent |
| 🟡 MeanPug | 41 | 14 | 35% | Great pitch, great brand, but $10K-$60K website scares some. Referral-heavy = warm |
| 🔵 LawRank | 51 | 18 | 35% | Strong reviews close deals. Portfolio speaks. Mid-market pricing works |
| 🟣 Grow Law | 54 | 16 | 30% | Good but nothing uniquely compelling. 24-month payment plan helps some |
| ⚪ DIY/Nothing | 0 | 800* | 80%* | *800 of 1,000 prospects do nothing and keep their current shitty website |

**Why Marko closes highest rate:**
- Showing the actual homepage redesign is an EMOTIONAL close (not logical)
- The audit data makes it LOGICAL too (double whammy)
- $12,500 with no contract vs $50K-$200K annual or $15K-$30K locked = obvious
- 90-day guarantee removes last objection
- "You own everything" kills the #1 fear from Scorpion escapees

### Revenue (Year 1 per 1,000 prospects)

Assuming Marko's clients split: 60% Path A ($12,500 + $500/mo), 40% Path B ($12,500 + $2,000/mo)

| Rank | Offer | Upfront | Monthly Recurring (by M12) | Year 1 Total |

## 🔑 THE CRITICAL INSIGHT

**Marko wins on VOLUME. The competitors win on REVENUE PER CLIENT.**

Rankings.io makes $120K/year per client vs Marko's $23K. But Marko gets 3.5x more clients from the same market.

### The gap closes with TWO moves:

**Move 1: Upsell to full SEO faster**
If 70% of Path A clients upgrade to Path B by month 6:
- Blended Year 1 per client jumps to **$31,400**
- Year 1 total from 52 clients: **$1,632,800**

**Move 2: Cross-sell MVA leads by month 6**
If 40% of clients buy 10 leads/month at $350/lead:
- Additional revenue: 21 clients × $3,500/mo × 6 months = **$441,000**
- **Revised Year 1: $2,073,800**

**Move 3: Raise prices after first 20 clients + case studies**
Once you have 20 PI firms with results, raise to:
- $15,000 build + $2,500/mo management
- Blended LTV jumps to $45K+ per client
- **Now you're competing with LawRank/Grow Law on revenue AND beating them on volume**

## 🎯 VERDICT

**Marko's offer wins the market on accessibility and close rate.**

Out of 1,000 PI lawyer prospects:
- **800 do nothing** (every agency's real competitor is inertia)
- **52 go to Marko** (more than any single competitor)
- **87 split across 5 other agencies**
- **61 remain in "thinking about it" limbo**

**The only weakness: revenue per client.** But that's by design — low entry price = more clients = bigger upsell base = MVA lead gen cross-sell.

The right play: **Win on volume now, raise prices with proof later, cross-sell leads always.**

This offer is ready to ship.
