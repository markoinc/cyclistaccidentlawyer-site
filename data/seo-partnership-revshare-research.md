# SEO Partnership / Revenue Share Model Research
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Focus:** Jacky Chou's SEO partnership model + broader rev-share SEO models applied to PI lawyers

---

## 1. JACKY CHOU'S SEO PARTNERSHIP MODEL — WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS

### Important Clarification: "Partnership SEO" ≠ "SEO Partnership with a Business Client"

Jacky Chou's primary "partnership" model is **NOT** partnering with a local business (like a PI lawyer) to do their SEO and share in their revenue growth. His model is specifically **parasite SEO / media partnership SEO**:

**Jacky Chou's Partnership Model (What He Actually Does):**
- Partners with **legacy media properties** (dying local newspapers, magazines with high Domain Authority — DR70+ sites)
- These media outlets have decades of trust/authority but declining revenue
- Jacky proposes: let him publish affiliate/commercial content on their domains (often in subfolders/subdirectories)
- The articles rank instantly because Google trusts the parent domain
- Revenue is split **50/50** between Jacky and the media outlet
- He monetizes via affiliate links (Amazon, supplements), display ads, and "rank-and-rent" placements where brands pay for top spots

**Scale at Peak:**
- $400-500K/month in Q1 2024 from partnership sites
- Over $2 million total generated from SEO partnerships
- Highest single placement: **$50,000/month + 50% commission** (supplement niche)
- 8 media partners simultaneously (via his agency Version.so)
- Version.so revenue: $125.5K/month in Nov 2023, with ~50% margins ($64K their cut)

**What Happened:**
- Google investigated Jacky personally and wiped all accounts connected to his name
- Partnership/affiliate revenue collapsed from **$550K/month to ~$16K/month**
- He pivoted to SaaS (LocalRank.so), community (Advise.so), and agency work

### Jacky's Pivot Toward Performance-Based Consulting

While his primary model was media partnerships, Jacky has **mentioned interest in** (but not extensively detailed) a performance-based consulting model:

> "He rather loves performance-based consulting—taking a percentage of client profit instead of flat fees." — StartupSpells analysis

> "He considers performance-based consulting and profit-share partnerships to align incentives with clients." — Same source

**Key Insight:** Jacky has expressed philosophical preference for performance-based consulting over flat retainers, but his documented, at-scale business was the parasite SEO media partnership model, NOT partnering with local businesses and taking a cut of their revenue growth.

### Jacky's Local SEO Client Work (Retainer Model)
- Through his Local Rank Academy, he teaches students to charge **$2,000/month retainers** for local SEO clients
- He had up to 30 retainer clients at one point, found it impractical and unsatisfying
- He expressed frustration with client work: "clients do not recognize the value added through SEO efforts"
- He explicitly said he dislikes client retainers and has canceled high-value contracts due to lack of interest

**Bottom Line:** Jacky Chou's model that you can extract lessons from is the **50/50 revenue split with domain authority partners**, not a traditional "I'll do your SEO and take a cut of your business growth" model. However, the principles (aligned incentives, performance-based, no retainer ceiling) translate.

## 2. OTHER SEO PROFESSIONALS DOING REVENUE SHARE / EQUITY SEO

### Smash Digital — Profit Share SEO (Most Relevant Example)
**Website:** smashdigital.com/profit-share-seo/  
**Model:** "We put our money where our mouth is. We don't make money until you make money."
- Takes **equity stakes in companies** or exchanges SEO services for profit share
- Has done SEO for 17+ of their own companies
- Their Crunchbase describes: "accepts clients when [it can take a business] to a new level, either through paying for equity in a company, or through an exchange for our SEO services and general help with growth"
- This is the closest real-world example to what you're considering

### Dennis Yu / BlitzMetrics — Incremental Revenue Model
**Model:** Instead of flat retainer, charges based on incremental revenue generated
- Example case study: Sal Stefano's IV therapy med spa system
  - Charges $2,000-3,000/month per med spa
  - Generates extra $20,000-30,000/month in revenue per client
  - Transitioned from flat retainer to **charging based on incremental revenue**
- Dennis Yu's philosophy: "If we were able to increase someone's business from $100M to $150M, we could receive 10% of that increase = $5 million"
- Key quote: "Think of ourselves as multipliers — we are not an expense, we get paid out of the profit"
- Works with PI attorney Daryl Isaacs as a client (interesting crossover)

### Reddit Agency Community Insights
**r/agency thread: "7-Figure agency using rev share model"** (March 2025, 19 votes):
- General consensus: "You generally end up doing way more work than you get paid for"
- "Clients" aren't as committed when they're not paying upfront
- Most agencies that try pure rev share struggle

**r/seogrowth thread: "Agencies that tie SEO results to revenue":**
- "True performance-only SEO is rare at scale"
- Recommended approach: **"Base retainer to cover costs, plus upside tied to qualified pipeline or revenue influenced, not rankings or traffic"**
- Attribution is the #1 challenge cited

**r/agency thread: "Considering equity in a unique partnership"** (March 2024):
- Suggested **Sliding Scale Revenue Share**: "5% of revenues up to $500K, then 4% on revenues between $500K-$1M..."
- Decreasing percentage as revenue grows (aligns incentives, prevents windfall at scale)

### Single Grain — 7 Performance-Based SEO Models
From their detailed breakdown:
1. **Rank-Based Bonuses** — bonus per keyword hitting target positions
2. **Traffic Growth SLA** — fees scale with net new non-brand sessions
3. **Lead Generation CPL** — cost-per-lead for MQLs/SQLs from organic
4. **Revenue Share for E-Commerce** — % of incremental revenue above baseline
5. **CPA (Per Sale/Action)** — fixed cost per completed action
6. **Hybrid (Retainer + Performance Kicker)** — base covers foundational work, bonus for milestones
7. **Pipeline/SQL-Based** — payouts tied to pipeline value or closed-won revenue

**Their recommendation for complex/long-sales-cycle businesses:** Model 6 (Hybrid) or Model 7 (Pipeline)

## 3. HOW THIS WOULD WORK FOR PI LAWYERS SPECIFICALLY

### Revenue Attribution for PI Law Firms

**The Challenge:** PI cases have long settlement cycles (6 months to 3+ years). Attributing a signed case to SEO vs. other channels requires sophisticated tracking.

**Tracking Stack Required:**
1. **Call Tracking** (CallRail, WhatConverts, or CallTrackingMetrics)
   - Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI) assigns unique phone numbers to organic search visitors
   - Every call from organic search is tagged and recorded
   - WhatConverts can track calls, forms, AND chats with full attribution
   
2. **Form Tracking**
   - UTM parameters + hidden fields on contact forms
   - Google Analytics 4 conversion events
   - CRM integration to connect form fill → intake → signed case

3. **CRM Integration (Closed-Loop Reporting)**
   - Connect marketing data (GA4, call tracking) with case management software
   - Track the full journey: Website Visit → Call/Form → Intake → Signed Case → Settlement
   - Software like CASEpeer, Clio, or CloudLex can track case origin

4. **Attribution Model**
   - **First-touch attribution**: Credit to first interaction (e.g., organic search)
   - **Last-touch attribution**: Credit to last interaction before contact
   - **Multi-touch**: Distribute credit across touchpoints
   - **Recommendation for rev share:** Use first-touch organic, with call tracking as primary verification

### Fair Revenue Share Percentage

**Industry Benchmarks for Performance-Based Models:**
| Model | Percentage | Context |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Dennis Yu / BlitzMetrics | 10% of incremental revenue | General digital marketing |
| Reddit sliding scale | 5% on first $500K, 4% on next $500K | Agency equity discussion |
| Smash Digital | Equity stake or profit share | Not publicly disclosed % |
| SaaS revenue share | 25% of subscription revenue | Industry standard |
| Single Grain recommendation | ~10% of organic revenue growth | Enterprise hybrid model |
| Jacky Chou media partnerships | 50/50 split | But this is on affiliate/ad revenue, not client business revenue |

**Recommended Range for PI Lawyers: 10-25% of INCREMENTAL organic revenue**

Factors that determine where in the range:
- **10-15%**: You provide SEO only, client handles all intake/conversion
- **15-20%**: You provide SEO + conversion optimization + content + ongoing management
- **20-25%**: You provide everything above + paid ads management + full digital marketing
- **25%+**: Only justified if you're taking significant financial risk (covering all costs with no minimum)

### Baseline Establishment

**How to set the baseline (critical for fairness):**
1. **Measure current organic revenue for 3-6 months BEFORE starting**
   - Track organic calls, forms, chats via call tracking
   - Connect to signed cases through CRM
   - Calculate average monthly revenue from organic-attributed cases
   
2. **Document the baseline in the contract**
   - Example: "Client's average monthly revenue from organic search-attributed cases over the 6 months preceding this agreement is $XX,XXX (the 'Baseline Revenue')"
   
3. **Rev share only applies ABOVE the baseline**
   - You get paid on: (Current Month Organic Revenue) - (Baseline Revenue)
   - If baseline is $20K/month and organic grows to $50K/month, you get paid on $30K incremental

4. **Adjust baseline annually**
   - Market conditions change, seasonal variations exist
   - Re-establish baseline each year or use rolling 12-month average

### Contract Terms — Key Provisions

**Duration:**
- Minimum **24-36 month initial term** (SEO takes 6-12 months to show results)
- After initial term, auto-renew annually with 90-day notice to cancel
- This protects the SEO provider who invests heavily upfront

**Tail Provision (CRITICAL):**
- If client terminates, SEO provider continues to receive rev share for 12-24 months post-termination
- Rationale: SEO work creates lasting assets (content, backlinks, authority) that continue generating leads
- Example clause: "Upon termination, Provider shall continue to receive [X]% of Incremental Organic Revenue for a period of [18] months following the effective date of termination ('Tail Period')"
- Alternative: Declining tail — 100% of rev share for 6 months, 50% for next 6 months, 25% for next 6 months

**Content & Asset Ownership:**
- If you create content, who owns it upon termination?
- Option A: Client owns all content (standard for retainer)
- Option B: Content created under rev share is licensed, not transferred — if they stop paying, you can request removal
- Option C: Client owns content but tail provision compensates for ongoing benefit

**Revenue Verification:**
- Right to audit signed cases and settlement amounts
- Access to case management system (read-only) or monthly reporting obligation
- Specify which CRM/tracking system is the "source of truth"
- Penalty clause for underreporting (e.g., 2x the amount owed if intentional underreporting is discovered)

**Non-Compete / Exclusivity:**
- You should have exclusivity in their market — can't work with competing PI firms in same geography
- They shouldn't hire another SEO — would muddy attribution

### Legal/Ethical Issues Specific to Lawyers

**Bar Association Rules:**
- Fee-sharing between lawyers and non-lawyers is prohibited in most states (ABA Model Rule 5.4)
- However, **marketing service agreements are NOT fee-sharing** — they're business expenses
- The key distinction: you're paid for marketing services, not legal services
- Your compensation should be described as a **marketing performance fee**, not a share of legal fees
- **Consult a legal ethics advisor** to ensure the agreement doesn't violate state bar rules

**Advertising Rules:**
- Lawyer advertising is heavily regulated state-by-state
- Ensure all content you create complies with applicable rules
- Include disclaimers as required by state bar

## 4. THE MATH — RETAINER vs. REVENUE SHARE

### Scenario Setup

**Assumptions:**
- PI firm currently does **$50K/month** in organic revenue (cases attributed to organic search)
- Standard retainer pricing: **$5,000-7,500/month**
- Revenue share: **20% of incremental organic revenue** above baseline
- SEO ramp period: 6 months before meaningful growth
- Growth trajectory: Conservative, moderate, aggressive

### Scenario A: Conservative Growth (10% organic revenue growth per year)

| Month | Organic Revenue | Incremental | 20% Rev Share | $5K Retainer | $7.5K Retainer |
|-------|----------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1-6 | $50K | $0 | **$0** | $5,000 | $7,500 |
| 7-12 | $52.5K | $2.5K | **$500** | $5,000 | $7,500 |
| 13-18 | $55K | $5K | **$1,000** | $5,000 | $7,500 |
| 19-24 | $57.5K | $7.5K | **$1,500** | $5,000 | $7,500 |

**Year 1 Total:** Rev share = ~$3,000 vs Retainer = $60K-90K  
**Year 2 Total:** Rev share = ~$15,000 vs Retainer = $60K-90K  
**Verdict:** Retainer **crushes** rev share at conservative growth. You'd lose ~$135K over 2 years.

### Scenario B: Moderate Growth (50% organic revenue growth Year 1, 30% Year 2)

| Month | Organic Revenue | Incremental | 20% Rev Share | $5K Retainer |
|-------|----------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1-6 | $50K | $0 | **$0** | $5,000 |
| 7-12 | $62.5K | $12.5K | **$2,500** | $5,000 |
| 13-18 | $75K | $25K | **$5,000** | $5,000 |
| 19-24 | $81K | $31K | **$6,200** | $5,000 |

**Year 1 Total:** Rev share = ~$15K vs Retainer = $60K  
**Year 2 Total:** Rev share = ~$67K vs Retainer = $60K  
**Breakeven:** ~Month 18  
**Verdict:** Rev share starts beating retainer in Year 2 but you eat $45K in losses in Year 1.

### Scenario C: Aggressive Growth (100% organic revenue growth Year 1, 50% Year 2)

| Month | Organic Revenue | Incremental | 20% Rev Share | $7.5K Retainer |
|-------|----------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1-6 | $55K | $5K | **$1,000** | $7,500 |
| 7-12 | $80K | $30K | **$6,000** | $7,500 |
| 13-18 | $100K | $50K | **$10,000** | $7,500 |
| 19-24 | $120K | $70K | **$14,000** | $7,500 |

**Year 1 Total:** Rev share = ~$42K vs Retainer = $90K  
**Year 2 Total:** Rev share = ~$144K vs Retainer = $90K  
**Breakeven:** ~Month 13-14  
**Verdict:** Rev share becomes a rocket ship in Year 2+. At $120K/month organic, you're earning $14K/month vs $7.5K retainer.

### Breakeven Analysis

**At 20% rev share vs $5,000/month retainer:**
- You need **$25K/month in INCREMENTAL organic revenue** to break even
- That's 50% growth from a $50K baseline
- Typically takes 12-18 months to achieve in competitive PI markets

**At 20% rev share vs $7,500/month retainer:**
- You need **$37.5K/month in INCREMENTAL organic revenue** to break even
- That's 75% growth from a $50K baseline
- Typically takes 18-24 months to achieve

**The Critical Insight:**
Rev share is a **bet on your ability to significantly grow organic revenue**. It's worse than retainer unless you can grow organic by 50%+ within 12-18 months. For PI lawyers in competitive markets, this is achievable but far from guaranteed.

### Real PI Lawyer Numbers

- Average PI case settlement: **$10K-75K** (varies hugely by case type)
- Attorney contingency fee: typically **33-40%** of settlement
- Average attorney fee per case: **$3,300-$30,000**
- Cost per signed case from SEO: **$500-3,000** (industry benchmarks)
- A small PI firm might sign **3-8 cases/month** from organic search
- Monthly organic revenue: **$10K-$240K** (extreme range)
- Realistic small/mid PI firm organic monthly revenue: **$30K-100K**

## 5. RISKS AND DOWNSIDES

### For the SEO Provider (You)

1. **Client Underreports Revenue**
   - They have every incentive to attribute cases to referrals, not organic
   - **Mitigation:** Install your own call tracking (CallRail/WhatConverts), require CRM access, audit rights
   - Include clause: if discrepancy >10% found in audit, client pays 2x difference + audit costs

2. **Hard to Attribute Cases to SEO**
   - Client runs TV ads, billboards, referrals simultaneously
   - A client may Google the firm name after seeing a TV ad → counts as "organic" but wasn't SEO-driven
   - **Mitigation:** Track non-brand organic traffic separately, exclude branded searches from attribution, use UTM parameters

3. **Long Ramp-Up = No Revenue for 6-12 Months**
   - SEO for competitive PI terms can take 12+ months
   - You're doing full work at zero compensation
   - **Mitigation:** Hybrid model (see Section 6) or minimum guarantee

4. **Client Cancels After SEO is Built Up**
   - They fire you after 18 months of work once rankings are established
   - They keep benefiting from content and links you built
   - **Mitigation:** Tail provision (12-24 months of continued rev share after termination)
   - Consider: content licensing (not ownership transfer) model

5. **Google Algorithm Updates Tank Rankings**
   - A core update could wipe out months of work overnight
   - Your revenue goes to zero while costs continue
   - **Mitigation:** Diversify traffic sources, build durable authority, don't rely on one keyword cluster

6. **Client's Business Issues Affect Your Revenue**
   - Poor intake process = organic leads don't convert to signed cases
   - Bad reviews = organic clicks drop
   - Staff turnover = calls go unanswered
   - **Mitigation:** Include minimum conversion rate requirements; if client's intake below threshold, switch to per-lead pricing

7. **Legal Ethics Risk**
   - In some states, marketing agreements that look too much like fee-sharing could violate bar rules
   - **Mitigation:** Have a lawyer review the agreement; frame as marketing performance fee, not legal fee share

### For the Client (PI Lawyer)

1. **Paying more than a retainer if SEO is very successful**
   - At aggressive growth, rev share could cost 2-3x what a retainer would
   - **Their mitigation:** Cap on total monthly payment, or declining percentage at higher revenue tiers

2. **SEO provider has access to sensitive data**
   - Call recordings, case types, revenue numbers
   - **Their mitigation:** NDA, data use restrictions, HIPAA-adjacent privacy protections

3. **Dependency on one provider**
   - If you leave, they don't know what you did or how to maintain it
   - **Their mitigation:** Documentation requirements, content ownership provisions

## 6. HYBRID MODELS (RECOMMENDED)

### Model A: Minimum Retainer + Revenue Share Kicker
**Structure:**
- Base retainer: $3,000-4,000/month (covers your costs)
- Revenue share: 15% of incremental organic revenue above baseline
- Once rev share exceeds retainer, rev share replaces retainer (not additive)

**Advantages:**
- You don't starve during ramp-up period
- Client pays less upfront than pure retainer
- Aligned incentives once growth kicks in

**Example Math:**
- Months 1-6: Client pays $3,500/month (retainer only, no rev share earned)
- Month 7: Organic grows $10K above baseline → 15% = $1,500. Still below retainer, so client pays $3,500
- Month 12: Organic grows $30K above baseline → 15% = $4,500. Client pays $4,500 (rev share exceeds retainer)
- Month 18: Organic grows $50K above baseline → 15% = $7,500. Client pays $7,500

### Model B: Reduced Retainer + Revenue Share (Additive)
**Structure:**
- Reduced retainer: $2,500/month (below market rate)
- Revenue share: 10% of incremental organic revenue
- Both are paid (retainer + rev share)

**Example Math:**
- Month 1-6: Client pays $2,500/month
- Month 12: $2,500 + (10% × $25K incremental) = $2,500 + $2,500 = $5,000/month
- Month 18: $2,500 + (10% × $50K incremental) = $2,500 + $5,000 = $7,500/month

### Model C: Setup Fee + Revenue Share Only
**Structure:**
- One-time setup fee: $10,000-15,000 (covers audit, strategy, initial implementation)
- Revenue share: 20% of incremental organic revenue
- No monthly retainer
- Minimum 24-month term

### Model D: Tiered Revenue Share with Cap
**Structure:**
- 20% on first $25K of incremental organic revenue
- 15% on next $25K
- 10% on anything above $50K incremental
- Monthly cap: $15,000

**This protects the client from paying too much at extreme growth while still rewarding you.**

### Model E: Per-Lead or Per-Signed-Case (Easiest to Track)
**Structure:**
- Track organic leads via call tracking + form tracking
- Pay $X per qualified lead or $XX per signed case from organic
- Example: $150 per qualified organic lead, or $1,500 per signed case from organic
- Baseline: first Y leads/month are "free" (represent existing organic performance)

**Advantages:**
- Simpler attribution than revenue tracking
- Don't need to know settlement amounts
- Easier for client to verify and accept

**Disadvantages:**
- Capped upside (a lead that becomes a $5M case pays the same as a $15K case)
- Need robust lead qualification criteria

## 7. RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR PI LAWYERS

### The Ideal Structure

**Model A (Minimum Retainer + Rev Share Kicker) is the safest bet.**

**Proposed Terms:**
1. **Minimum monthly fee:** $3,500/month (covers your costs + small margin)
2. **Performance tier:** Once organic-attributed signed cases exceed $X/month baseline, you earn 15-20% of the incremental revenue
3. **Tracking:** CallRail or WhatConverts for call attribution, CRM integration for closed-loop reporting
4. **Baseline period:** 3-month tracking period before contract starts to establish baseline organic performance
5. **Term:** 24 months minimum, auto-renew annually
6. **Tail:** 18-month tail at full percentage after termination
7. **Exclusivity:** You don't work with competing PI firms in same metro, they don't hire additional SEO providers
8. **Audit rights:** Quarterly access to case management system for verification
9. **Revenue cap:** Monthly performance fee capped at $15K (protects client, gives you defined upside)

### Why This Works for PI Lawyers Specifically

1. **PI lawyers understand contingency models** — they work on contingency (getting 33% of settlement). A rev share model speaks their language.
2. **High case values justify the model** — A single additional signed PI case from SEO could be worth $10K-$30K+ in attorney fees. Paying 15-20% of that growth is a no-brainer if the growth is real.
3. **Call tracking makes attribution clean** — PI firms live on phone calls. Call tracking with DNI gives clear organic attribution.
4. **Long sales cycles match SEO timelines** — Both SEO and PI cases take time. Lawyers are used to waiting for payoff.
