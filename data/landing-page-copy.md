# PI CaseFlow System — Landing Page Copy
## Two Versions: Liberation (Existing Firms) + New Firm (Starting Fresh)

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# VERSION A: "LIBERATION" LANDING PAGE
# For PI lawyers trapped with a bad vendor
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 1. HERO SECTION

### Headline
**Stop Paying $3,000/Month for a Website You Don't Own.**

### Subheadline
We rebuild your PI firm's website on infrastructure you actually own. Migrate everything — content, SEO equity, rankings. Handle your vendor cancellation. Live in 30 days. You never pay rent on your own website again.

### CTA Button
**[ Check If Your Market Is Still Available ]**

### Below-CTA micro-copy
*We only work with ONE personal injury firm per metro area. Once your market is taken, your competitors can't hire us.*

---

## 2. PAIN SECTION

### Section Headline
**Sound Familiar?**

- **You're paying $2,000-$5,000 every month** for a website built on a "proprietary CMS" you can't take with you. That's $24,000-$60,000 a year — and you're renting. If you leave, you start from zero.

- **Your vendor works with your competitors.** Same market. Same playbook. The firm writing the bigger check gets the attention. You get the B-team.

- **You've thought about leaving, but it feels like a hostage situation.** They own the site. They own the content. Some of them own the *domain*. Walking away means walking away from everything you've paid for.

- **Your site is slow, your rankings are flat, and you're tired of reports full of vanity metrics** that never translate into signed cases. Traffic goes up. The phone doesn't.

### Section closer
*You're not bad at marketing. You just hired people who profit more from keeping you dependent than from getting you results.*

---

## 3. SOLUTION SECTION

### Section Headline
**What If You Actually Owned Your Website?**

Here's what we do differently from every agency you've worked with:

**We rebuild your entire website on Cloudflare/Vercel** — the same infrastructure Fortune 500 companies use. Your site loads in under 100 milliseconds. Not 3-5 seconds. Milliseconds. Google notices.

**We migrate everything.** Every page, every image, every blog post. We build a comprehensive 301 redirect map so you don't lose a single ranking. Your SEO equity follows you.

**We fire your vendor for you.** We draft the cancellation letter, manage the transition timeline, handle the DNS transfer, and make sure there's zero downtime. You sign one letter and never think about them again.

**You own 100% of everything.** The website, the domain, the content, the code, the analytics. All credentials handed to you on launch day. If you ever want to leave us, you take everything with you. No exit fees. No hostage situations.

**One firm per market. Period.** We treat your market like you treat your client conflicts — exclusive. Your competitors literally cannot hire us.

---

## 4. SOCIAL PROOF SECTION

### Section Headline
**Built for PI Firms That Are Done Getting Burned**

> *(PLACEHOLDER: Insert 2-3 testimonials here once available. Until then, use the section below.)*

**Initial trust elements to display:**

- **Logo bar:** "Trusted by personal injury firms in [X] markets" — add firm logos/city names as clients sign on
- **Speed comparison widget:** Side-by-side load time test — "Your current site vs. a PI CaseFlow site" (run a live PageSpeed comparison)
- **"As seen in" / credential badges:** Kurios Brand LLC registered entity, any bar association partnerships, Google Partner badge if applicable
- **Counter/social proof ticker:** "Currently serving PI firms in [X] metro areas" — updates as markets fill
- **Process credibility:** "30-day launch process. 0 missed deadlines." (Update the number as you deliver projects)

**Suggested early testimonial format (get these ASAP from first 2-3 clients):**

> "I was paying Scorpion $X,000/month and didn't even own my site. [Kurios] rebuilt everything, migrated my rankings, and I haven't written a monthly check since. The site loads faster than anything I've ever seen."
> — [Name], [Firm], [City]

---

## 6. PRICING SECTION

### Section Headline
**Simple, Transparent Pricing Based on Your Existing Site**

No hidden fees. No "call for a quote" games. Your tier is based on how many pages your current site has — because that's what determines the migration work involved.

---

### STANDARD — $12,500
**For firms with under 20 pages**

Most solo PI sites fall here. We rebuild every page — better design, better copy, better SEO — and migrate you to infrastructure that loads in under 100 milliseconds.

- Everything in the full stack above
- Up to 20 pages rebuilt from scratch
- Full migration + 301 redirect map
- 50 legal directory citations
- Top 20 keyword strategy
- Top 3 competitor analysis
- 60 days post-launch support

**Payment: $6,250 to start. $6,250 at launch.**

---

### PROFESSIONAL — $18,500
**For firms with 20-39 pages**

More pages means more content to migrate, more SEO equity to preserve, and more redirect mapping. This tier covers the additional complexity.

- Everything in Standard, plus:
- Up to 39 pages rebuilt
- 3 published long-form blog articles (2,000+ words)
- 75 legal directory citations
- Top 35 keyword strategy + content gap analysis
- Top 5 competitor analysis with backlink gap
- 90 days post-launch support + 2 strategy check-in calls

**Payment: $9,250 to start. $9,250 at launch.**

---

### ENTERPRISE — $27,500
**For firms with 40+ pages**

Large, content-rich sites with years of accumulated SEO authority. This is a strategic migration — we audit every page, keep what's working, consolidate what's weak, and rebuild on infrastructure that's 10x faster.

- Everything in Professional, plus:
- 40+ pages — full content audit + rebuild
- Enterprise-level migration with zero-downtime cutover
- 5 published long-form blog articles
- 3 practice area video scripts

- 6-month content calendar (24 topics)
- 3 monthly strategy calls over first 90 days
- 90 days priority support

**Payment: $13,750 to start. $13,750 at launch.**

---

### Below pricing — context frame:

> **To put this in perspective:** If you're paying your current vendor $3,000/month, that's $36,000 a year for a website you don't own. Our one-time fee pays for itself in a few months of what you're *already spending* — and then you never pay monthly rent again. This isn't a new expense. It's the last website check you'll ever write.

---

### Optional: Ongoing SEO

**After your site launches, we offer month-to-month SEO retainers starting at $5,000/month.**

No contracts. No commitments. Cancel any month with 30 days notice. If we're not delivering, fire us — we'll make it easy. Unlike your last vendor.

Your active retainer also maintains your geographic exclusivity beyond the first 12 months.

---

## 7. GUARANTEE SECTION

### Section Headline
**Four Guarantees. Zero Risk.**

We stack our guarantees because we've seen what "no guarantees" looks like in this industry — it looks like Scorpion charging you $5,000/month with zero accountability.

---

**🚀 On-Time or It's Free**
Your website will be live within 30 days of kickoff. If we miss that deadline, the entire project is free. Not discounted. Free. We've never missed a deadline.

**💰 30-Day Satisfaction Guarantee**
If you're not thrilled with your website in the first 30 days after launch — for any reason — you get a full refund. No questions. No hoops. No awkward conversations. We can offer this because we've never had a client ask for one.

**📈 90-Day Performance Guarantee**
If your website doesn't generate at least 10 qualified leads in the first 90 days (from Google, your GBP, directories, or AI search), we keep working for free until you hit that number — up to an additional 90 days. All we ask: keep your Google Business Profile active, respond to leads within 24 hours, and don't modify the site without checking with us first.

**🔑 Full Ownership Guarantee**
You own everything. The website, the domain, the content, the code, the analytics. It's all built on your accounts, under your name. If you ever want to leave, you take everything with you. No exit fees. No proprietary CMS. No hostage situations. This is structural, not just a promise.

---

### Below guarantees — closer:
*Name another agency in this space that offers even ONE of these guarantees. We'll wait.*

---

## 8. EXCLUSIVITY / URGENCY SECTION

### Section Headline
**One Firm Per Market. No Exceptions.**

Here's why this matters more than anything else on this page:

We only work with **one personal injury firm per metropolitan area.** This isn't a marketing gimmick — it's a real constraint. We can't rank two competing PI firms in the same market and deliver results for both. So we don't try.

**Once your market is taken, your competitors cannot hire us.**

That means the firm that moves first gets:
- A website optimized to dominate your local search results
- Geographic exclusivity for 12 months (included with purchase)
- The ability to lock out every other PI firm in your metro from working with us
- Ongoing exclusivity as long as you maintain an active SEO retainer

**That also means:** If you wait, and your competitor signs first, this page is useless to you. We'll literally have to turn you away.

We're currently in conversations with firms in multiple markets. We can't hold a spot without a signed agreement.

### CTA
**[ Check If Your Market Is Available → ]**

### Micro-copy below CTA
*Takes 30 seconds. We'll confirm availability and schedule a strategy call if your market is open.*

---

## 9. FAQ SECTION

### Section Headline
**Questions We Get Asked**

---

**Q: How is this different from what Scorpion / FindLaw / my current vendor does?**

Three things. First, you own everything — the site, the domain, the content, the code. No proprietary CMS, no hostage situation. Second, we only work with one PI firm per market, so we're never optimizing for your competitor at the same time. Third, we actually guarantee results — on-time delivery, satisfaction, and performance. Ask your current vendor if they'll guarantee any of that.

---

**Q: Will I lose my Google rankings when I switch?**

No. We build a comprehensive 301 redirect map before we touch anything. Every URL on your old site gets properly redirected to its new equivalent. Your SEO equity transfers with you. We've done this enough times to know exactly how to preserve what you've built — and improve on it.

---

**Q: What do you mean by "30-day launch process"? That seems fast.**

It is fast — intentionally. Most agencies take 3-4 months because they're juggling dozens of clients across dozens of industries. We serve one industry, we have systems built specifically for PI firm websites, and we don't waste time. You'll spend about 30 minutes on a strategy call and maybe 20 minutes reviewing the draft. Under an hour of your time total. We handle everything else.

---

**Q: What if I don't like the final website?**

You get a full refund within 30 days of launch. No questions asked. But here's the reality: we don't start building until we understand your firm, your market, and your goals. You review and approve the content direction before we build. By the time you see the finished product, it reflects your firm — not a template.

---

**Q: I'm locked into a contract with my current vendor. Can I still work with you?**

Yes. We'll review your current contract, identify the termination terms, and plan the transition around your contract end date. We can start the build process now and time the launch to coincide with your exit. We've helped firms leave Scorpion, FindLaw, and every other major legal vendor — we know how they operate.

---

**Q: Why is this a one-time fee instead of monthly?**

Because monthly fees are how vendors keep you dependent. You pay once, you own the asset forever. It's the same reason you buy your office instead of renting — ownership builds equity. The only ongoing cost is our optional SEO retainer, which is month-to-month with no contracts. Stay because it's working, not because you're trapped.

---

**Q: What happens after the 12 months of geographic exclusivity?**

Your exclusivity continues automatically as long as you have an active SEO retainer with us. If you cancel, you get a 90-day grace period before the exclusivity expires and we can work with another firm in your market. We're not trying to trap you — the retainer makes your site better AND keeps your competitors out. It's the smart play for both of us.

---

**Q: One PI case averages $16,500 in fees. You're telling me the website pays for itself with one case?**

That's exactly what we're telling you. At $12,500 for the Standard tier, a single signed PI case more than covers your investment. Everything after that is pure return on an asset you own forever. Compare that to paying $3,000/month indefinitely for a site your vendor keeps if you leave.

---

## 10. FINAL CTA SECTION

### Section Headline
**Your Competitor Is Reading This Page Too.**

One firm per market. Once it's taken, it's taken.

You already know your current situation isn't working. You're paying monthly rent for a website you don't own, built on a platform designed to keep you dependent, managed by a vendor who also works with your competitors.

The PI CaseFlow System replaces all of that in 30 days. One investment. Full ownership. Geographic exclusivity. Four guarantees that remove every ounce of risk.

One signed PI case — average fee $16,500 — and the website has paid for itself. Everything after that is profit flowing through an asset you own.

**The only question is whether your market is still available.**

### CTA Button
**[ Check Your Market Availability Now → ]**

### Below button — final micro-copy
*30-minute strategy call. No pitch deck. No pressure. We'll tell you exactly what your site needs, what the migration looks like, and whether we're a fit. If your market is already taken, we'll tell you that too.*

### Headline
**Build Your PI Firm's Website Right the First Time.**

Most PI lawyers spend years paying rent on a website they don't own — then pay again to escape. Skip that entire chapter. Get a conversion-optimized, SEO-ready website you own from day one. Live in 30 days.

### CTA Button
**[ Claim Your Market Before a Competitor Does ]**

### Below-CTA micro-copy

---

## 2. PAIN SECTION

### Section Headline
**Every Week Without a Real Website Costs You Cases**

- **You're losing cases to firms with worse lawyers but better websites.** Potential clients don't know you're the better attorney — they called the first firm that showed up on Google. That firm had a fast, professional site with clear calls to action. You had... nothing. Or a Wix page your nephew built.

- **Referrals alone won't scale your firm.** They got you started, and that's great. But referrals plateau. When you're ready to grow from $500K to $2M, you need potential clients finding you on Google, on their own, at 2 AM after an accident.

- **The "quick fix" will cost you twice.** Throwing up a cheap template site or hiring a general freelancer means you'll be back here in 12 months — except now you'll also need to fix broken SEO, redirect old URLs, and undo the damage. The firms that do it right the first time don't go through that.

- **Your competitors already have a head start.** Every day they're indexed and you're not is a day they're building SEO authority that becomes harder to catch. The gap gets wider every week.

### Section closer
*The good news: you have something most of our clients would kill for — a blank slate. No bad vendor to escape. No broken SEO to fix. No hostage situation to negotiate. Just an open road.*

---

## 3. SOLUTION SECTION

### Section Headline
**What "Building It Right" Actually Looks Like**

Most new PI firms make the same mistake: they rush to get *something* online, then spend the next 2-3 years fixing it. Here's what we do instead:

**We build your website on Cloudflare/Vercel from day one.** The same infrastructure used by the biggest companies on the internet. Your site loads in under 100 milliseconds — while your competitors' agency-built sites take 3-5 seconds. Speed is a ranking factor. You'll have an advantage from the moment you launch.

**Every page is written specifically for personal injury.** Not by a generalist copywriter who also writes for dentists and plumbers. Our content systems are built for PI law — the right keywords, the right tone, the right conversion elements for people who just had the worst day of their life and need a lawyer now.

**SEO is baked in, not bolted on.** Schema markup, keyword-targeted content, internal linking architecture, Google Business Profile setup — it's all done at launch. You don't need to "add SEO later." Later is too late.

**You own 100% of everything.** The website, the domain, the content, the code. All of it is yours from day one. No proprietary CMS. No vendor lock-in. If you ever want to take it to another agency or manage it yourself, you walk away with everything. This is how it should have always been done — most firms just didn't know that until it was too late.

**One firm per market.** We only work with one PI firm per metropolitan area. Sign first, and your competitors can't hire us. It's that simple.

## 4. SOCIAL PROOF SECTION

### Section Headline
**The PI CaseFlow System — Purpose-Built for Personal Injury Firms**

> *(PLACEHOLDER: Insert testimonials once available. Until then, use the section below.)*

**Initial trust elements to display:**

- **Speed demo:** Interactive load-time comparison — "Average PI firm website vs. a PI CaseFlow site" (show a typical 3-4 second Scorpion site against the sub-100ms CaseFlow performance)

- **Process timeline graphic:** Clean visual showing the 30-day launch process (4 weeks, what happens each week, minimal client time required)

- **ROI calculator widget:** "Enter your average case fee → see how fast the site pays for itself" (pre-filled with $16,500 default)

**Suggested early testimonial angle (for first new-firm clients):**

> "I opened my firm three months ago. By week four I had a site that looked like I'd been in practice for a decade. By month three I was getting calls from Google. Best money I've spent on the firm."
> — [Name], [Firm], [City]

## 6. PRICING SECTION

### Section Headline
**Transparent Pricing. No Surprises.**

Your tier is based on how many pages your site needs. More practice areas, more locations, more content = more pages. Simple.

---

### STANDARD — $12,500

The foundation. Homepage, practice area pages, attorney bio, about, FAQ, case results, contact — everything a new PI firm needs to look established and start generating cases online.

- Full stack (everything listed above)
- Up to 20 custom pages
- 50 legal directory citations
- Top 20 keyword strategy
- Top 3 competitor analysis
- 60 days post-launch support

**Payment: $6,250 to start. $6,250 at launch.**

For firms with multiple attorneys, multiple practice focuses, and aggressive growth plans. This is a full digital foundation — the kind of site that usually takes firms years and six figures to build.

- 40+ custom pages with full content strategy
- 5 published long-form blog articles
- 3 practice area video scripts (ready to record)
- 100 legal directory citations
- Top 50 keyword strategy

- 90 days priority support

**Payment: $13,750 to start. $13,750 at launch.**

---

### Below pricing — ROI frame:

> **The math is simple:** One personal injury case brings in an average of $16,500 in fees. Your website investment starts at $12,500. **One signed case and you've made your money back** — and the website keeps working for you month after month, year after year. There is no better investment for a new PI firm than a web presence that generates its own cases.

---

### Optional: Ongoing SEO

**Once your site is live, we offer month-to-month SEO retainers starting at $5,000/month.**

Blog content, link building, GBP management, citation monitoring, monthly reporting, strategy calls. No contracts. Cancel any month. Your active retainer also maintains your geographic exclusivity beyond the included 12 months.

---

## 7. GUARANTEE SECTION

### Section Headline
**We Guarantee the Work. All of It.**

You're starting a firm. You're taking enough risks already. This shouldn't be one of them.

---

**🚀 On-Time or It's Free**
Your website will be live within 30 days of kickoff. If we miss the deadline, you don't pay. Period. We've never missed one.

**💰 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee**
Don't love the final product? Full refund within 30 days of launch. No questions. No forms. No runaround. We don't keep money we didn't earn.

**📈 90-Day Performance Guarantee**
If your website doesn't generate at least 10 qualified leads in the first 90 days (from Google, your GBP, legal directories, or AI search), we keep working for free until you hit that number — up to an additional 90 days. We ask three things: keep your GBP active, respond to leads within 24 hours, and don't modify the site without telling us.

**🔑 Full Ownership — From Day One**
You own the website, the domain, the content, the code, and every account. It's all in your name. No proprietary platforms. No lock-in. Other agencies make you rent your own website. We think that's insane.

---

### Below guarantees:
*Starting a firm is a leap of faith. Hiring us shouldn't be. Four guarantees. Zero risk.*

## 8. EXCLUSIVITY / URGENCY SECTION

### Section Headline
**Lock Out Your Competitors Before They Lock Out You.**

Here's the advantage of being a new firm that finds us early:

We only work with **one personal injury firm per metro area.** Most of our clients are established firms escaping bad vendors — they find us after years of frustration.

**You found us first.**

That means you can claim your market before any competitor in your area even knows we exist. Once you sign, they can't hire us. Not next month. Not next year. Your exclusive access to our systems in your market is included for 12 months — and continues as long as you maintain an active SEO retainer.

Think of it this way: every other PI firm in your city will eventually need to rebuild their website. When they go looking for the best option, your market will already be taken. By you.

## 9. FAQ SECTION

### Section Headline
**Questions New Firms Usually Ask**

---

**Q: I'm a new firm with no online presence. Is $12,500 worth it when I'm just getting started?**

Bluntly: there is no higher-ROI investment for a new PI firm. One signed case averages $16,500 in fees — that's more than your entire website investment. The alternative is a cheap template site that doesn't rank, doesn't convert, and costs you cases every day it exists. Then you pay to fix it later. Build it right from the start.

---

**Q: How long until I start getting cases from the website?**

Your site will be live in 30 days. SEO takes time — anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. Typically, you'll start seeing organic leads within 60-90 days as Google indexes and ranks your pages. Our 90-day performance guarantee exists because we're confident in that timeline. In the meantime, the site is optimized for conversions from day one — so any traffic from your GBP, directories, referrals, or other sources converts at a higher rate immediately.

---

**Q: I don't have many photos, a logo, or firm branding yet. Is that a problem?**

Not at all. We work with what you have. If you need professional headshots, we'll advise you on the fastest, most affordable way to get them. If you don't have a logo, we can work with a clean text-based identity or connect you with a designer. Most new firms are in this exact situation — we've built the process around it.

---

**Q: Do I really need all this? Can't I just start with a basic site?**

You can. Most new firms do. And then 12-18 months later, they're paying someone to redo the whole thing because the "basic site" doesn't rank, doesn't convert, and doesn't reflect the quality of their practice. We've watched it happen dozens of times. The PI CaseFlow System is designed to skip that cycle entirely.

---

**Q: What's included in the 30-day process? How much of my time does this take?**

About one hour total. You'll spend 30 minutes on a strategy call (Week 1) where we learn about your firm, your practice areas, and your goals. Then about 20-30 minutes reviewing the content draft (Week 2). That's it. We handle everything else — the design, the copy, the SEO, the technical build, the launch.

---

**Q: What happens after launch? Do I need the SEO retainer?**

The website is a complete, standalone asset — it works without a retainer. But SEO is an ongoing game. Your competitors are publishing content and building backlinks every month. The retainer keeps the momentum going: blog posts, link building, GBP management, citation monitoring, reporting. It's month-to-month, no contracts, cancel anytime. We don't lock you in because we don't need to.

---

**Q: What does "geographic exclusivity" mean for me as a new firm?**

It means we only work with one PI firm in your metro area. When you sign, your competitors cannot hire us — not for a website, not for SEO, not for anything. You get 12 months of exclusivity included with the website purchase. After that, maintaining an active SEO retainer keeps the exclusivity going indefinitely. For a new firm, this is a significant early-mover advantage.

---

**Q: Can I see a demo or example site?**

Yes. On your strategy call, we'll walk you through live examples of PI CaseFlow sites — real sites, in real markets, performing in real search results. We'll also show you exactly what your site would look like based on your firm's details.

You can do it the way most PI lawyers do — cheap template, figure it out later, pay to fix it in a year.

Or you can do it right. A website built for personal injury from the ground up. Optimized for conversions. Optimized for SEO. On infrastructure that loads in milliseconds. With geographic exclusivity that keeps your competitors from accessing the same systems.

One investment. Full ownership. Four guarantees that remove every ounce of risk. And a site that pays for itself with a single signed case.

Most of our clients wish they'd found us before they signed with their first agency. You don't have to make that mistake.

**Your market is either open or it isn't. There's only one way to find out.**

### CTA Button

## Shared Notes for Both Versions

### Primary CTA Logic
The "Check Your Market Availability" CTA should lead to a short form:
1. Name
2. Firm name
3. City/Metro area
4. Phone number
5. Email
6. "Do you currently have a website?" (Yes/No) — routes to correct follow-up

### A/B Test Opportunities
- **Hero headlines:** Test the current headlines vs. more specific versions (e.g., "Stop Paying Scorpion $3,000/Month..." or "Your PI Firm's Website in 30 Days. You Own It.")
- **CTA button text:** "Check Your Market" vs. "See If Your City Is Available" vs. "Get Your Free Strategy Call"
- **Pricing display:** Show all 3 tiers vs. show only Standard with "larger firms click here"
- **Guarantee placement:** Test guarantees higher on the page (above pricing) vs. current position

### Pages to Create
- **Version A** → `/get-started` or `/liberation` or `/switch` — for paid traffic targeting lawyers with existing sites
- **Version B** → `/new-firm` or `/start` — for paid traffic targeting new practices
- **Homepage** → Hybrid version that funnels to A or B based on "Do you have an existing website?" question

### Retargeting Sequences
- Visitor hits page but doesn't convert → Retarget with "Your market is still available — for now" messaging
- Visitor starts form but doesn't complete → Email: "We checked — [City] is still open. Here's what [competitor firm] is doing in your market right now."
- Visitor converts but doesn't book call → SMS + email sequence, 3 touches over 5 days

### SEO Targeting for the Landing Pages Themselves
- Version A: "PI lawyer website migration," "switch from Scorpion," "own your law firm website," "PI website rebuild"
- Version B: "PI lawyer website design," "new law firm website," "personal injury attorney website," "PI firm web design"

### Voice & Tone Reminders
- NO: "innovative," "cutting-edge," "AI-powered," "solutions," "leverage," "synergize," "best-in-class"
- YES: Direct, plain English, empathetic, confident, slightly irreverent toward bad vendors
- Write like you're talking to a smart person who's been lied to by every agency they've ever hired
- The reader is a lawyer — they're sharp, skeptical, and they read contracts for a living. Don't insult their intelligence.
