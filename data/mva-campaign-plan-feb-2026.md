## 📝 WINNING AD COPY (Bases for New Ads)

### Winner 1: Ad #18b — "Quality Problems Hide as Volume"

**Headline:** Quality Problems Hide as Volume

**Body:**
> You don't have a lead volume problem.

You have a lead quality problem disguised as volume.

Your vendor sends 100 MVA leads. Your intake qualifies 15. You sign 5. You blame intake for the 85 that didn't qualify.
But those 85 were never going to sign. They weren't real injury cases. They weren't high intent. They were clicks, not clients.

Here's the real solution:

Stop receiving leads. Start receiving signed cases.

We fund the marketing. We generate the demand. Our PI-trained intake team qualifies prospects and closes retainers on your behalf.
You don't touch the lead until it's already a case.

~$2,000 average cost per signed case. 30-50% conversion from warm transfer to closed.

No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

Quality isn't just upstream. It's delivery.

**Nano Banana Prompt:**
Near-black (#1A1A1A) background with subtle data visualization texture. TOP: "THE MATH YOUR VENDOR DOESN'T SHOW YOU" in white header. CENTER: Side-by-side calculator/breakdown displays. LEFT DISPLAY (labeled "LEAD MODEL"): "100 leads delivered" in white, arrow down, "15 qualified (15%)" in amber, arrow down, "5 signed (5%)" in muted gray, arrow down, "CPA: $4,000" in red-gray, verdict: "YOU DO THE WORK" stamped. RIGHT DISPLAY (labeled "CLOSED CASE MODEL"): "100 prospects contacted" in white, arrow down, "65 qualified (65%)" in #3399FF, arrow down, "25 signed (25%)" in #3399FF with glow, arrow down, "CPA: $2,000" in #3399FF bright, verdict: "WE DO THE WORK" stamped. BOTTOM: Equation style—"Same budget × We close = 5X signed cases" in white with key numbers in #3399FF. Financial calculator aesthetic. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, soft gradients, emojis.

### Winner 2: Ad #17b — "Speed Won't Fix Bad Leads"

**Headline:** Speed Won't Fix Bad Leads

**Body:**
> Speed-to-lead won't fix bad MVA leads.

You can call in 30 seconds. You can have the best intake script. You can follow up seven times. None of it matters if the lead wasn't a real injury case to begin with.

Most PI firms try to solve conversion problems at intake. They hire trainers. They buy dialers. They run reports.

But they're optimizing the wrong part of the funnel.

Here's the actual fix: stop receiving leads entirely.

We fund the marketing. We generate the demand. Our PI-trained intake team qualifies prospects and closes retainers on your behalf. You receive signed cases—not contacts to chase.

~$2,000 average cost per signed case. 30-50% conversion from contact to closed.

No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

Stop optimizing intake. Start receiving signed cases.

### Winner 3: Nothing Ad — Website Only

**Headline:** Pre-Qualified MVA Live Transfers

**Body:** *(none — website traffic only)*

**Nano Banana Prompt:** *(not applicable — minimal creative)*

---

### Winner 4: ad15 — "The One-to-One Difference"

**Headline:** The One-to-One Difference

**Body:**
> One campaign. One firm.

That's how we operate.

Not campaigns shared across competitors. Not lead pools split between firms. Not races to the same prospects.

One-to-one means you're the only firm receiving leads from that campaign.

Here's the real solution:

Stop competing for shared leads. Start receiving exclusive leads.

We work with limited firms per market. We fund the marketing. We generate the demand. Our automated systems qualify and deliver exclusive pre-qualified leads directly to your CRM.

Exclusive isn't a marketing term. It's the operating model.

~$2,000 average case cost. 15% conversion rate (you handle intake).

No retainers. No setup fees. We fund the ad spend.

One campaign. One firm. Exclusive leads.

**Nano Banana Prompt:** *(needs creation)*

## ✅ THE FIX — Explicit Qualifiers

Every new ad MUST start with explicit PI attorney targeting:

| Current First Line | Should Be |
|--------------------|-----------|
| "You don't have a lead volume problem..." | "**PI ATTORNEYS:** You don't have a lead volume problem..." |
| "Your lead vendor gets paid..." | "**FOR LAW FIRMS ONLY:** Your lead vendor gets paid..." |
| "The PI firms dominating your market..." | "**If you're not a personal injury lawyer, keep scrolling.** The PI firms dominating..." |
| "One campaign. One firm." | "**FOR PI ATTORNEYS ONLY:** One campaign. One firm." |

No form-fill garbage. No random clickers. No "I don't remember signing up."

Just qualified prospects ready for your intake call.

Exclusive to your firm. We fund the marketing. You handle intake. You close.

No retainers. No setup fees.

Quality leads. Your intake. Your cases.

**Nano Banana Prompt:**
