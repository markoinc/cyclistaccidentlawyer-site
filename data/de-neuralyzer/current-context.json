I want you to have a really good understanding of all my projects and everything ive ever thought of starting with you or made plans to start (not just in supermemory but in files outside of supermemory that are undiscovered). my simple overarching goal is to make 9.6M as quickly as possible also, consider the memory compaction as a neuralyzer like from men in black, how can we make a deneuralyzer agent that undoes compaction (agent k) also, i want the best setup to manage multiple agents, im thinking of switching to discord, will agents be able to collaborate in group channels in discord? i want to make sure I have separate head agents managing projects Sierra Assistant, [2/1/2026 12:31 AM] This is a meaty overnight mission. Let me clarify a few things to nail it: Goals/Context: 1. What time do you usually wake up? (So I know my deadline) 2. For the dashboard - what would \"insanely surprised\" look like? Real-time data? AI recommendations? One-click actions? Voice control? Give me the dream. Multi-Agent Architecture: 3. Yes, Discord agents CAN collaborate in group channels - each agent sees messages and can respond. You could have: \u2022 #mva-leads \u2192 MVA Head Agent \u2022 #concrete-seo \u2192 Concrete Head Agent \u2022 #general \u2192 All agents + you Is this the vibe? Or do you want them ",
