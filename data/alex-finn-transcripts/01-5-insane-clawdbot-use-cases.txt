Claudebot is taking the entire internet by storm right now and for good reason. It is what I believe to be the most powerful amazing AI tool of 2026. The issue is most people are just experiencing 1% of its power. Most people just install it and ask it what the weather is. That's a huge mistake. In this video, I'll go over five Clawbot use cases that you can implement right now that will save you time, make you money, and change your life. Let's get into it.

So, here is the first thing I wake up to every morning that has been incredibly helpful for me that I will show you how to set up. I'm going to give you the prompt for each one of these use cases I'm going through. This is a morning brief that I'm going to show you how to set up that's going to give you some really important information. The most important thing here is probably this mission control. What this mission control does is it takes a look at my to-do list every single day. It tells me what I need to work on today, what my Claudebot Henry is going to work on today, and what my Claudebot Henry actually worked on last night while I was sleeping.

If you haven't yet, you need to connect your Clawbot to one of your to-do list systems. I connected mine to a to-do list called Things 3, which is an amazing Mac to-do list app, but even if you're on PC, you can connect it to many other to-do list. Just talk to your Cloudbot about which to-do list you use. And so this morning brief first lets me know what I need to work on today. Updates me what my CloudBot's going to work on because again, Claudebot is one of the most amazing proactive AI tools out there. And it lets me know what it got done while I was sleeping.

It also looks up trending news. So it looks online based on what it knows about me. I didn't tell it what to look up. It just knows based on our conversations what to look up and finds trending news based on my interests and then gives me things I can execute on today. So, I came up with the idea to react to one of Matthew Berman's Claudebot videos. Shout out Matthew Burman. Amazing AI creator. My Claudebot saw that Matthew Berman made a video that was similar to one of my own videos. So, wants me to put out a response. My Claudebot is petty.

It also came up with an idea. So, it looked at my calendar. It's seeing that I have a Mac studio coming in in two weeks and it's like, okay, maybe you should create content around it. That's actually a really good proactive idea I came up with. And then it saw that we have a newsletter draft in our shared folder and it says, "Okay, we came up with this. I think it's time for you to send it." This is amazing. So, this is all in my morning brief. And this is just incredible proactive information that I wake up to every single morning.

So, how do you set this up? Here is the prompt, and I'll put this down below. So, feel free to pause right here, copy and paste into your Clawbot if you want, or just wait till the end, then come back after the video.

PROMPT 1 - MORNING BRIEF:
"I want you to send me a morning brief every morning at 8 a.m. my time. I want this morning brief to include the local weather for the day. A list of a few trending YouTube videos about my interest. So, it's important your Claudebot knows all about you. Make sure it knows all your interests. If it doesn't, tell it all your interests. A list of tasks I need to get done today based on my to-do list. Connect it to your to-do list. If you don't know how to do that, just go to your CloudBot, say, "Hey, connect to my to-do list. Tasks that you think you can do for me today that will be helpful based on what you know about me." Super critical. Encourages your Claudebot to be more proactive. a list of trending stories based on my interests and recommendations you can make for me that will make today super productive."

For the list of trending stories one, I'd recommend connecting to the Brave search API. That will allow Claude to be a little bit more efficient when it comes to web search. And then the last parts, the recommendations you can make for me today that will make today super productive. Again, a little bit of reverse prompting. Basically, what that means is you're having Claude prompt you, which is tell you what to do that day. Really, really helpful. Take that prompt from down below, put in your Clawbot, you are all set up.

The next use case I'm going to show you is an amazing one. And again, I'll give you the prompt right after so you can copy paste and get this implemented really quick. But this prompt turns your Claudebot into a proactive vibe coding machine without me even asking. My Claudebot Henry built this entire document viewer that automatically takes our conversations and puts them into really nice documents. It built out this entire project management system. So I can see Henry, my Cloudbot, complete tasks as he goes. All without me asking, which is really amazing.

So what this prompt does, and I wish I could include more of this on the screen, but the UI, maybe I'll improve the UI for Clawbot in a little bit. The UI doesn't expand here, but this prompt turns your Clawbot into a proactive coder that builds things without you asking. And this might be my favorite use case of Claudebot overall. What this prompt will do is basically give your Claudebot permission to build things without you having to tell it.

PROMPT 2 - PROACTIVE VIBE CODING:
"I am a one-man business. I work from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. I need an employee taking as much off my plate and being as proactive as possible. Please take everything you know about me and just do work you think would make my life easier or improve my business and make me money. I want to wake up every morning and be like, "Wow, you got a lot done while I was sleeping." Don't be afraid to monitor my business and build things that would help improve our workflow. Just create PRs for me to review. Don't push anything live. I'll test and commit. Every night when I go to bed, build something cool I can test. Schedule time to work every night at 11:00 p.m."

Take this prompt, put it in. What this is going to do is schedule your Clawbot to think every night what it can build for you and vibe code it out. After I gave it this prompt, it started building out so many helpful features to improve our working relationship. It's been unbelievable.

Couple tips I'll give you though. One is I would highly recommend especially if you're using Opus as your main model here to install Codeex CLI if you're on a chat GPT subscription. This will allow it so that Opus is kind of your brain that organizes all of this and Codeex is actually the tool it uses to vibe code. This will save you a lot of tokens on Opus which is a very expensive model. So get codeex CLI installed then go to your Claudebot and say hey make sure to use the codec CLI anytime you vibe code. that will save you a ton of tokens. Prompt for this down below as well.

The next thing you should do with your Clawbot that will make it so much more powerful is have it vibe code you a second brain. So, it actually vibe coded this for me proactively, but it's been so helpful that I recommend everyone explicitly go out of their way and have their Clawbot build it. What this does is amazing. It basically builds an interface where I can go back and I can either view memories it created. So I can like review what we've talked about in prior days or view documents that record important information we discussed.

So this entire interface was built by my claudebot and it shows all these documents it's creating in real time as we chat. And then it gives me this really nice markdown viewer where everything is formatted nicely. It also automatically tags each one of the documents with journal content, newsletters, notes, YouTube scripts so I can very quickly organize them.

But what you can see here is a few things. one, every day it creates a journal entry. And in this journal entry, it shows exactly what we talked about. I love at the end of the week going back and just rereading everything we discussed every day of the week just to remind myself of when I had quick ideas. If any, if you're anything like me, you're constantly using Telegram just to text your Clawbot random ideas that come to your head. This is a great place to go back and review all those random thoughts that came to your head.

It also takes important concepts you discussed and fleshes them out in their own documents. So for instance, in two weeks I have a Mac studio coming in where I'm going to run a whole bunch of local models. So much more content on that coming very soon by the way. But because we were discussing this, I was discussing my Claudebot Henry how to migrate from this Mac Mini I'm on to the Mac Studio. It actually built me out an entire migration dock automatically that I can now go back and review later on when I'm ready to migrate.

So, this second brain, mission control, it calls it, is so so helpful because it allows me to go back and review really important conversations we had and go into the details on a lot of the important aspects of them.

PROMPT 3 - SECOND BRAIN:
"I want you to build a second brain. This should be a next.js app that shows a list of documents you create as you work together in a nice document viewer that feels like a mix of obsidian and linear. For me, those are my two favorite UIs for apps. I want you to create a folder where all the documents in that folder are viewable in the second brain. Update your memory skills so that when we talk every day, you create documents in that second brain that explore some of the more important concepts we discuss. You should also create daily journal entries that record from a high level all our daily discussions."

Copy paste that into your Cloudbot and ensure before you hit enter on that that you've told your Claudebot you want to use Codeex as your coding tool just so you can save tokens on Opus if you're using Opus. I've loved having the second brain. It's made using Claudebot so much more pleasant.

So, our fourth use case ties in very nicely with our second brain here, and that is a daily research report that Claudebot will build for you based on what it knows about you, your interests, and your business. So, I have it scheduled every afternoon, which is basically my afternoon brief instead of a morning brief. I want a research report that I can read every single afternoon that goes into depth on one of my interests or a way to improve my business.

So, I'll get a text every day on my Telegram from my Clawbot out of the blue that says, "Hey, I built this entire research report that will either a teach you something about a concept you're interested in, like machine learning or AI, or B, a concept I think will improve the way you do work, improve your business, or improve the way we work together."

So, here's an example, one I got yesterday, which is just workflow improvement ideas between me, my Claudeb Henry. It just did research based on everything I've told it, based on all my interest, based on what we've done in the past, based on all our past journal entries, what would be some interesting ways it could improve our working relationship. So, just systems we can implement where it watches my GitHub or a self-reflection routine where it comes up with self-improvement for itself or even weekend build projects. This just keeps your Claudebot thinking about how it can improve everything it does and it keeps itself improving. This has been a massive use case you should implement.

PROMPT 4 - DAILY RESEARCH REPORT:
"I want a daily research report sent to me every afternoon. Based on what you know about me, I want you to research and give me a report about a concept that would improve me, processes that would improve our working relationship, or anything else that would be helpful for me. Examples would be deep dives on concepts I'm interested in in like machine learning or new workflow we can implement together that will improve our productivity."

Again, all these prompts are basically around making your cloudbot more proactive for you, more productive, and just improving your working relationship. Copy and paste that prompt in. Your Clawbot's instantly smarter.

The last use case I want to go over with you is a Claudebot skill that has absolutely blown me away. It's from Matt Van Horn. I'll link down to Matt Van Horn's profile down below. Make sure to follow him on X. It is a skill that teaches Claudebot how to research X and Reddit in parallel for big trends that are coming.

So, this has been massive for me. This has helped me come up with so many concepts or videos, content, or just seeing what people on the internet have to say. This teaches Claudebot how to research Reddit and X and find things people are talking about and topics that are trending based on what you want it to research. So, for instance, I wanted it to research Claudebot use cases. It went in and it researched over the last 30 days all the top Claudebot use cases by engagement on Reddit and on X. So, it can show me all the top Reddit threads, all the top exposts about Claudebot use cases, and then it even gave me a bunch of content ideas from the research. This is incredible. Anytime you have to research something, you need to be using this skill because it will get you the latest topics off Reddit and X.

All that's required from this is to install the skill, which I'll show you how to do in a second, as well as an XAI API, so the Grock API as well as an OpenAI API key so they can check out Reddit. So, all you want to do, and I'll link to this down below, is take the link to this skill, give it to Claudebot, and say, "Please install this skill." Once it does that, you're good to go. And you can just say, "Hey, use the last 30 days skill to find me information on whatever topic you want, and you'll get a research report just like I showed you."

It has been incredible for me for finding information and seeing what people are talking about. And you can even implement it in interesting ways. If you want it to be a part of your morning brief to see what other people are saying on Reddit about specific topics or your afternoon research report, whatever you want, get this skill installed. It's my favorite skill by far.

After implementing these five use cases, my workflow has 10xed. All the people saying Claudebot's not capable of anything important, I dare you to show me how your normal LLM can do everything I just showed you. I promise you it can.

If you learned anything at all, make sure to leave a like down below. I do weekly boot camps on Claudebot inside the Vibe Coding Academy. Link for the Vibe Coding Academy down below. You can join the boot camps and ask me questions live. Also, make sure to subscribe and turn on notifications. All I do is make incredible videos about AI. And there's so many more videos about Claudebot coming very soon. And they'll only ratchet up a notch once my Mac Studio comes in and I start running local models on it. Hope this was helpful. See you in the next video.
