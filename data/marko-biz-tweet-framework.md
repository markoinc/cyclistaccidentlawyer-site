## 💡 Key Insights from Your Data

1. **Threads outperform singles** — Your client portfolio thread (188 impressions) and accounting threads (76+ impressions) crush your solo tweets
2. **Vulnerability gets engagement** — Posts about struggles ($15k debt, self-doubt, resistance to closing) get more replies
3. **The "$880 from two phone calls" format works** — Story + specific dollar amount = curiosity
4. **Date stamps are underrated** — Quick, low-effort, creates a visual timeline people can follow
5. **You stopped posting biz updates after July 2025** — Your audience lost the thread during the pivot. Time to restart the narrative.

## 🎯 Immediate Action: The Comeback Post

Since you pivoted from concrete rank & rent ($12k/mo peak) to PI lead gen (rebuilding), your next post should bridge the gap:

```
I was making $12k/mo in passive income.

Then I walked away from it.

Here's why, and what I'm building now: ⬇️

[Thread explaining the pivot, the $9.6M goal, and where you are now]
```

This re-engages your audience and sets the stage for the new chapter of updates.
