## EP 650 - The Complete Reddit Marketing Course ($2000 VALUE)

### WHY REDDIT?
Everyone thinks Reddit is impossible to scale. That's partly true — if you do it the dumb way. But Reddit ranks for a ton of "BEST X" queries (best protein powder, best CRM, best running shoe), and that's where the money and intent live.

**Quick note:** don't be obvious. Don't post spam or look like you're selling. Pretend you're a real fan. Add value first, then add the soft pitch.

### If the target thread is open for comments — what to do

**Goal:** Add value, rank your comment, and nudge clicks without looking like an ad.

**Tactics:**
- Read before you post. Don't reply with a promo. Answer the OP or contribute new insight.
- Lead with value. First sentence = quick hook or useful nugget (stats, 1–2 tips). Second sentence = context + credibility. Last line = soft CTA ("I wrote a short comparison here" / "my experience was X — link in profile").
- Use formatting. Short paragraphs, emojis sparingly, bold or caps for one-liners if the subreddit allows. Make it skimmable.
- Add evidence. Screenshots, short before/after numbers, or an image if the sub allows images. Real proof beats hype.
- Engage replies. Once your comment gets traction, reply to replies to keep it alive and provide more value.
- Rotate CTAs. Some comments link to a blog; others to a landing page; some to a free checklist.
- Track & iterate. Use Signals (or manual monitoring) to see which comments get clicks, replies, and ranking lift.

**Compliant comment template:**
1. Short hook — "I tried this for X months and here's what happened."
2. 2–3 quick data points / what worked / what didn't.
3. "If you want the short checklist I used, here's a link to my free page (no spam)."

### If your thread is LOCKED

**Goal:** Capture the same search intent — but on a fresh, better piece of content.

**Tactics:**
- Create a better thread that targets the exact same keyword/intent
- Optimize the title for the "best X" keyword
- Seed initial organic engagement by asking early fans/followers to comment genuinely
- Run a small paid Reddit ad to the post (if allowed)
- Update the post with new tests, user comments, and data

### ORM: How to handle hate on Reddit (ethical way)

**Tactics:**
- Acknowledge & fix publicly
- Encourage genuine reviews from satisfied customers
- Respond with nuance
- Run an AMA or Q&A
- **"Reddit very easy to change the narrative, downvote bomb them, Reddit users are betas"**
- Upvote users who speak highly of you

## EP 742 - We spammed Reddit with 10k+ comments - The Full SOP

### The 10-Minute Reddit Domination SOP (Trackings.ai)

**Goal:** get your brand into threads that already rank on Google for "best X / recommended X" queries, then push your comment into the top 3 so it becomes evergreen traffic.

### Step 1 — Pick 5 "money keywords"

Pick 5 keywords with obvious buying intent:
- "best [category]"
- "[category] recommendations"
- "[category] vs [category]"
- "is [brand] worth it"
- "best [category] for [use case]"

**Rule:** if you can imagine someone buying within 7 days, it's a money keyword.

### Step 2 — Find threads that already rank

Use Trackings.ai → Discover.

What you're looking for:
- threads ranking on Google already
- 20+ comments (alive enough to blend in)
- recent activity OR evergreen thread

### Step 3 — Decide your placement type

1. **Unlinked mention (safest, highest survival)**
   - "I've been using [Brand] and it's been solid…"
2. **Nofollow link (medium risk)**
   - link to a neutral resource page
3. **Direct link (rarest, highest risk)**
   - only if subreddit allows

**Rule:** start with unlinked, graduate to links only when you've proven survivability.

### Step 4 — Write the comment using the "Human Stack"

**Template:**
- Line 1: empathy — "I had the same problem…"
- Line 2: mini story — "Tried 2–3 options, wasted money/time…"
- Line 3: recommendation (soft) — "[Brand] ended up being the easiest…"
- Line 4: balanced comparison — "If you just need X, tool A works. If you want Y, this is better…"
- Line 5: exit line (anti-shill) — "not sponsored, just what worked for me"

**Style rules that increase survival:**
- lowercase is fine
- one small typo is fine
- don't sound like a landing page
- don't say "game changer", "revolutionary", "introducing"

### Step 5 — Post fast on new threads, surgically on old ones

**A) New thread:** be early — first 5 comments get most visibility
**B) Existing ranking thread:** be useful — answer OP directly

### Step 6 — "Conversation Stack" to lock position

To rank top 3, you need replies + upvotes.

**Do this:**
- main comment
- 1st reply (agree / add detail)
- 2nd reply (tiny tip / personal note)

Make each reply feel like a different person:
- one is short + casual
- one is slightly more detailed
- one is just "+1, same experience"

### Step 7 — Boost like a human

**Safe boost pattern:**
- Zero votes in 2 weeks
- Drip over 2 days
- stop once you hit top 3

**Rule:** once you're top 3, you're "visibility locked." Don't keep blasting.

### Step 8 — Track survivability + refresh winners

- if comment gets removed → rewrite and re-place in different thread
- if comment slips from top 3 → small drip boost
- every 30–60 days → add a fresh reply to keep it alive

**KPI:** top 3 comments in threads that rank on Google = compounding traffic.

## EP 653 - 7-Day Sequence That Prints Appointments

**Software used:** Mailchimp, Pabbly, Meta, SMS provider

### What we're building

**Goal:** turn Meta Instant Form leads into booked appointments using a 7-day email + SMS + phone follow-up.

**Stack:** Meta Ads (Instant Forms) → Mailchimp list + automation → SMS (Twilio/TextMagic/ClickSend) → Caller/Setter.

**Offer:** "Free initial assessment" + "We'll check your benefits—could be $0 out-of-pocket."

### Speed-to-Lead SLA (why this works)

- Call in <5 minutes whenever possible
- If no pickup → immediate SMS → Email 1 fires instantly
- Daily call window: 9am–7pm
- Make 3 call attempts/day for 2 days, then 1/day to day 5
- Assign one owner (setter) and track in a simple sheet

### Automation logic (Mailchimp overview)

**Entry:** tag = source:meta adds them to Journey: "New Lead – Assessment"

**Branches:**
- If Booked tag applied → exit journey
- If No Answer after Day 3 → shift tone to education + trust
- Suppression: exclude if they click "Already booked" link
