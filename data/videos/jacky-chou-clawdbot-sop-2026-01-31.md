## His Response to "I Can Do That With Any LLM"

> "It's like someone going into an art gallery of a super famous artist like Picasso and saying 'I could paint that.' The main point is **you didn't** and you've probably never shipped anything meaningful either."

> "Broke people think harder is smarter. How I see Clawbot is like how people saw the computer or the calculator."

> "At 10K per day revenue, every hour saved is $400+. You're optimizing for near zero dollars per hour."

## How Jacky Uses Clawdbot

### 1. Morning Digest
- List of emails
- Briefing of what happened yesterday
- Marketing letter
- Daily posts on Telegram channel

### 2. Reddit Warm-up System
- **50 accounts** currently being warmed up
- Running daily
- **0% ban rate** (zero bans)
- Claims other platforms are easier than Reddit
- Makes money from Reddit, so he's vocal about it

### 3. SEO Audits on Demand
- Trained on:
  - All his tweets
  - All previous audits
  - 85-page local SEO guide
- Claims output is "very intense" compared to basic LLM audits

### 4. Design Work
- Uses browser agents
- Says Clawdbot is "just better" for this

### 5. Overnight Research Sub-Agents (Key Use Case!)
**Example workflow:**
1. "Cloudbot, find all my competitors for Local Rank"
2. "Search their Facebook Ad Library"
3. "Scrape all their videos"
4. "Download them"
5. "Categorize them"
6. "Rewrite them"
7. "Present me 30 scripts I can just read"

**Then:**
- He reads the scripts
- Adds to HeyGen (AI avatar generator)
- Passes to editor
- **Result: 30 new ads for Local Rank**

### 6. WordPress Plugin Generation
- 16 new free tools/plugins created overnight
- These become free tools on Local Rank site

### 7. AI Influencer (Telegram mention)
- Auto-replies using **$0 local LLM**
- Impressions doubled every day since inception
- 744K views total in 28 days
- 39K views in last 28 days

## Key Mindset Points

1. **"Sum maxing"** - Brute force, don't overthink, just ship
2. **Execute > Perfect** - Dumb idiots who ship make more money
3. **Time value** - At $10K/day, every hour = $400+ saved
4. **Skeptics will be obsolete** - "People not coming around to agents will be obsolete in 2 months"

## Revenue Context (Jan 2026)
- Total: $254K/month (down 10% from Dec due to post-holiday slowdown)
- Amazon: Part of revenue
- Mediavine: Part of revenue
- Anti Resource: Part of revenue
- Daily revenue: ~$685 (day of recording)

## Key Takeaway
> "To the haters: check out my revenue update. It gives me peace to know that people who are not coming around to agents will eventually be made obsolete in the next two months."

## Actionable Ideas for Marko

1. **Competitor Ad Scraping Pipeline**
   - Find competitors → Scrape FB Ad Library → Download videos → Categorize → Rewrite → Generate scripts
   - Could apply this to MVA lead gen competitors

2. **Reddit Warm-up System**
   - 50 accounts, 0% ban rate
   - Could use for building authority in PI/MVA subreddits

3. **AI Avatar Ads**
   - HeyGen for video generation
   - 30 ads from one research session

4. **Free Tool Generation**
   - WordPress plugins as lead magnets
   - Could create MVA-related calculators/tools
