Campaign ID: cam_KA5TnGSZ89gao52tz
Sender: carlos@kuriosbrand.com (email) + Carlos LinkedIn

### STEP 1 — LinkedIn Profile Visit (Day 0)
No message — just visit their profile so they see your name.

### STEP 2 — Email 1 (Day 1)
**Subject:** MVA cases for {{companyName}}

{{firstName}},

Quick question — is {{companyName}} currently taking on motor vehicle accident cases?

We're a lead gen firm that delivers exclusive, pre-qualified MVA cases to PI attorneys across the US. Live transfers and signed retainers — not recycled leads.

We guarantee a minimum of 15 cases for new partners.

Worth a quick 15-min call this week?

### STEP 3 — LinkedIn Invite (Day 3)
{{firstName}} — we help PI firms like {{companyName}} fill their pipeline with exclusive MVA cases. Would love to connect.

### STEP 4 — Email 2 (Day 5)
**Subject:** not recycled leads

{{firstName}},

Following up — I know your inbox gets hammered.

Here's why firms switch to us:

→ Every lead is exclusive to one firm (never shared)
→ Live transfers directly to your intake team
→ TCPA-compliant, one-to-one consent with your firm's name
→ 15-case minimum guarantee

We've delivered 500+ cases for a Texas PI firm over 4 years, 40+ monthly cases in California, and we're active in all 50 states.

15 min and I'll prove it.

Carlos

### STEP 5 — LinkedIn DM (Day 7, if invite accepted)
Hey {{firstName}} — thanks for connecting! Quick question: is {{companyName}} actively buying MVA cases right now? We've got capacity for a new partner and results have been strong. Happy to share specifics on a call.

### STEP 6 — Email 3 (Day 9)
**Subject:** the offer

{{firstName}},

Cutting to it:

• 15+ guaranteed MVA cases/month
• Exclusive to {{companyName}} — we don't share leads
• Live transfers to your intake
• Pay only for qualified cases that meet your criteria

Not a lead mill. We run the ads, qualify the leads, and hand you signed cases.

15 min this week?

### STEP 7 — Email 4 (Day 12)
**Subject:** closing your file

{{firstName}},

Reached out a few times — taking the hint.

If MVA cases aren't a priority for {{companyName}} right now, no worries at all.

If timing was just off, reply "later" and I'll circle back in a couple months.

## Campaign 2: LinkedIn Accepted Connections
Sender: carlos@kuriosbrand.com (email) + Carlos LinkedIn

### STEP 1 — LinkedIn DM (Day 0, immediately after acceptance)

Hey {{firstName}}, appreciate you connecting!

Quick question — does {{companyName}} use any external vendors for lead generation, or is it all handled in-house?

### STEP 2 — Email 1 (Day 2)
**Subject:** nice to connect, {{firstName}}

{{firstName}},

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn — wanted to follow up here.

I work with PI firms that are looking to grow their MVA caseload without adding overhead. We deliver exclusive, pre-qualified motor vehicle accident leads — live transfers and signed retainers.

If {{companyName}} is currently using external vendors for leads (or thinking about it), I'd love to do a quick 15-min call to see if we're a fit.

### STEP 3 — LinkedIn DM 2 (Day 5, if no reply to first DM)

{{firstName}} — didn't mean to leave you hanging. Just curious if lead gen is something {{companyName}} is exploring right now?

We guarantee 15+ exclusive MVA cases/month for new partners. Happy to share how it works on a quick call.

### STEP 4 — Email 2 (Day 7)
**Subject:** what makes us different

{{firstName}},

Most lead gen companies sell the same leads to multiple firms. We don't.

Here's how we work:

→ Exclusive leads — one firm per lead, period
→ Live transfers to your intake team
→ TCPA-compliant, one-to-one consent with your firm's name
→ 15-case minimum guarantee for new partners
→ Active in all 50 states

We've delivered 500+ cases for a single Texas firm, and 40+ cases/month in California alone.

If {{companyName}} is buying leads from anyone else, I'm confident we can beat both their quality and price.

15 min?

Carlos

### STEP 5 — Email 3 (Day 10)
**Subject:** quick example

{{firstName}},

One quick example: a mid-size PI firm came to us after getting burned by shared lead vendors. Within 60 days they were getting 100+ exclusive MVA cases per month at a lower cost per case than what they were paying before.

The difference? One-to-one leads, live transfers, and a guarantee.

If that sounds worth exploring for {{companyName}}, let's talk.

### STEP 6 — Email 4 (Day 14)
**Subject:** should I close your file?

{{firstName}},

Haven't heard back, so I don't want to keep filling up your inbox.

If MVA cases aren't a priority right now — totally understand. I'll close out your file.

If timing was just off, reply "later" and I'll reconnect in a few months.

Either way, no hard feelings.

Carlos
