Hey Marc,

Perfect — $15k to start works great. Here's what to expect:

**Campaign Overview**
- **Budget:** $15,000
- **Estimated leads:** 40-60 (we'll optimize for lowest cost per lead)
- **State:** Ohio
- **Delivery:** 2-4 weeks from launch
- **First leads:** 5-7 business days after payment

**On API delivery** — absolutely, we can push leads directly into your system. I'm CC'ing Carlos and Sierra on our team to coordinate the API setup with your IT person. We'll just need your endpoint URL, any auth requirements, and the field mapping you want.

**Next steps:**
1. Review & sign the agreement: **[AGREEMENT LINK]**
2. Pay the invoice: **[INVOICE LINK]**
3. Your IT sends us the API details → we configure lead delivery
4. Campaign launches within 5-7 business days

Looking forward to getting this rolling.
