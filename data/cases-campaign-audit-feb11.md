## 🚨 ISSUES FOUND

### Minor Issues (Optional Fixes)

1. **LP doesn't mention "one-to-one campaigns" explicitly** — only says "exclusive"
   - **Fix:** Add "one-to-one campaigns" to Why It Works section
   - **Priority:** Low

2. **Quiz doesn't ask about current cost per case** — helpful for sales call
   - **Fix:** Add optional question
   - **Priority:** Low

3. **No video creative** — competitors dominate with video
   - **Note:** Marko specified static only for now
   - **Priority:** Future consideration
