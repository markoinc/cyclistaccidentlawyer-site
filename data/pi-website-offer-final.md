## 1. THE OFFER

### Name
**The PI CaseFlow System**

### Tagline
*"Stop renting your web presence. Own it. We rebuild your site, migrate your content, and fire your vendor — in 30 days."*

### Positioning Statement
> The only web design and migration service built exclusively for personal injury law firms. We rebuild your website on a platform you actually own, migrate everything from your current vendor — content, SEO equity, redirects — and handle the cancellation so you never pay rent on your own website again. Proprietary technology. Premium custom design. Conversion-optimized. SEO-ready from day one. Geographic exclusivity — we work with ONE PI firm per market. Your competitors literally cannot hire us.

### Why This Name Works (M.A.G.I.C. Formula)
- **M**agnet — "CaseFlow" = the thing every PI lawyer wants (more cases, flowing in)
- **A**vatar — "PI" = announces exactly who it's for
- **G**oal — Cases. Not traffic, not rankings. Cases.
- **I**nterval — 30-day launch process (we deliver faster internally, but frame as professional timeline)
- **C**ontainer — "System" = not just a website, it's a machine

### Internal Note: Delivery Speed
**We can deliver in 7-10 days internally.** But we frame externally as a "30-day launch process" because:
- Websites delivered in 7 days trigger price skepticism ("how good can it be in a week?")
- 30 days signals thoroughness and premium quality
- Gives buffer for client review cycles and migration complexity
- Still dramatically faster than industry standard (6-16 weeks)
- Under-promise, over-deliver — when it's ready in 2 weeks they're thrilled

**NEVER say "AI-built" in external messaging.** Use:
- "Proprietary technology"
- "Streamlined systems"
- "Our proven build process"
- "Our proprietary content and design systems"

---

### 30-Day Launch Process

**This is a competitive weapon. Frame the speed as quality — we're efficient, not rushed.**

| Week | Phase | What Happens | Client's Role |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Week 1** | **Discovery & Migration Audit** | 30-minute strategy call. We audit their current site — pull all content, page inventory, backlink profile, keyword rankings, redirect map. We identify everything worth preserving from their existing web presence. Our proprietary systems generate initial copy, page structures, and SEO blueprint. | Show up for 1 call. Provide current vendor login info. |
| **Week 2** | **Content & Design** | All page content produced: homepage, practice area pages, about, attorney bios, FAQ, case results, testimonials framework. Content migrated and improved from existing site. Custom design applied — homepage, inner pages, mobile-responsive layout. Brand colors, attorney photos, practice area imagery. WordPress build begins. | Review and approve content direction (email, not another call). |
| **Week 3** | **Build, SEO & Technical** | Full WordPress build. Schema markup (LocalBusiness, Attorney, FAQ, Review). On-page SEO: title tags, meta descriptions, H1s, internal linking, alt tags. 301 redirect map from old site built and tested. Core Web Vitals optimization (<2s load time target). Mobile performance tuning. SSL, security headers, image compression. Analytics, Search Console, call tracking setup. Google Business Profile optimization. | Nothing. We're building. |
| **Week 4** | **Review, Migrate & Launch** | Full site presented for review. Client gets revision window. Revisions applied. Final QA. DNS pointed — old site replaced. 301 redirects activated (preserves all SEO equity). Site goes LIVE. Client gets full WordPress admin access, all login credentials, and ownership documentation. GBP linked and verified. **We handle cancellation of old vendor.** | Review the site. Approve final version. Sign the vendor cancellation letter we draft for you. |

**Key talking point:** *"You'll spend 30 minutes on a call and maybe 20 minutes reviewing the draft. Under 1 hour of YOUR time total. We handle everything else — including firing your old vendor."*

---

## 2. PRICING TIERS

### Architecture: Page-Count Based Pricing

Pricing is based on the number of pages on their **existing site** that need to be rebuilt and migrated. This is simple, transparent, and directly tied to the work involved. No confusing feature bundles — every client gets the full stack.

**On the call:** *"How many pages does your current site have? ... Okay, that puts you in our [tier] range."*

**$12,500 is the floor.** No project goes below this.

### Annual Framing (Use This on Calls)
> *"A website rebuild at $12,500 plus our SEO retainer at $7,500/month is $102,500 for the year. That puts you in mid-tier agency territory — the same level as firms spending six figures with Rankings.io or Scorpion — but you OWN the website, you get geographic exclusivity, and you can cancel the retainer any month. Try canceling Scorpion."*

---

### TIER 1: STANDARD — $12,500 (Under 20 Pages)

**Who it's for:** Solo practitioners and small firms with a basic existing site (homepage, about, a few practice area pages, contact). Most solo PI lawyer sites fall here.

**Profit math:** COGS ~$1,500-$2,500 → Gross margin: **80-88%**

---

### TIER 2: PROFESSIONAL — $18,500 (20-39 Pages)

**Who it's for:** Small to mid-size firms (2-5 attorneys) with more developed sites — multiple practice area pages, attorney bios, blog posts, case results pages, location pages.

**Typical client:** Has 20-35 pages across practice areas, maybe some blog content, multiple attorney profiles. More content to migrate, more redirects, more SEO equity to preserve.

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|

| **Migration** | Full content migration + comprehensive 301 redirect map + SEO equity preservation + blog post migration |

| **Hosting** | Cloudflare Pages/Vercel — same blazing infrastructure |

**Why the jump from $12,500 → $18,500 is justified:**
- 2x the pages to rebuild = 2x the content migration, redirect mapping, and SEO optimization
- Blog post migration adds complexity (preserving post dates, categories, internal links)
- 3 published blog articles included (not just topics)
- Expanded competitor analysis and keyword research
- More support time (90 days vs 60)

**Positioning on calls:** *"Your site has [X] pages — that's a lot of content and SEO equity we need to carefully migrate. The good news: every one of those pages becomes an asset you own, optimized to actually generate cases. The extra investment covers the migration complexity and the expanded SEO work to make sure nothing gets lost in the transition."*

**Profit math:** COGS ~$2,500-$4,000 → Gross margin: **78-86%**

---

### TIER 3: ENTERPRISE — $27,500 (40+ Pages)

**Who it's for:** Established firms (3-10+ attorneys) with large, content-rich sites — dozens of practice area pages, location pages, extensive blog archives, multiple attorney profiles, resource libraries.

**Typical client:** Has 40-100+ pages. Often on Scorpion or a legacy custom CMS. Complex migration with years of accumulated content, backlinks, and SEO authority.

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Pages Rebuilt** | 40+ pages — full site rebuild with content audit (migrate the best, consolidate the weak, kill the dead weight) |
| **Migration** | Enterprise-level: full content, backlink preservation, comprehensive redirect map, historical blog archive migration, legacy URL structure handling |
| **Vendor Cancellation** | White-glove vendor transition — overlapping service periods, DNS management, zero-downtime cutover |
| **Hosting** | Cloudflare Pages/Vercel — scales to any size |
| **Design** | Premium custom design with advanced conversion: sticky CTAs, exit-intent popups, social proof tickers, case result showcase with filtering, multi-attorney directory |

| **AI Visibility** | Advanced AEO + entity-building strategy document |
| **Competitor Report** | Top 5 competitors: backlink gap, content gap, ranked opportunity list |
| **Case Value Calculator** | Interactive lead capture widget |
| **Live Chat** | Chat integration with advanced intake flow |
| **Content Calendar** | 6-month content calendar: 24 blog post topics |
| **Blog Articles** | 5 long-form SEO articles published + all existing blog posts migrated |

| **Ownership** | 100% everything. Yours forever. |

**Why $27,500 for 40+ pages:**
- Massive migration complexity (40-100+ pages, years of blog archives, complex URL structures)
- Content audit required — not just migrating, but deciding what to keep, consolidate, or cut
- Legacy CMS extraction can be painful (especially Scorpion's proprietary platform)
- More redirect mapping, more backlink preservation, more SEO equity at stake
- 5 published articles + video scripts + strategy calls included
- Still **dramatically cheaper** than what they're currently paying ($50-200K/year at comparable agencies)

**Positioning on calls:** *"A site with [X] pages represents years of accumulated content and SEO authority. This isn't a simple rebuild — it's a strategic migration. We audit every page, keep what's working, improve what's weak, and rebuild the whole thing on infrastructure that's 10x faster. At $27,500 it's a fraction of what you'd pay Rankings.io for a single year."*

**Profit math:** COGS ~$4,000-$6,000 → Gross margin: **78-85%**

## 3. MIGRATION & LIBERATION

### The Core Positioning Shift

**Old frame:** "We build you a new website."  
**New frame:** "We rebuild your website, migrate you off your current platform, and fire your current vendor."

This is not a new expense. This is a liberation. Every PI lawyer currently paying $1,500-$5,000/month for a website they don't own is hemorrhaging money. We're the escape hatch.

### The Savings Math (Use on EVERY Call)

> *"Let me ask you something. How much are you paying your current vendor per month? $2,000? $3,000?*
>
> *Okay, so at $3,000 a month, you're spending $36,000 a year for a website you don't own. If you leave, they keep the site. They keep the content. They keep the domain in some cases. You start from scratch.*
>
> *Give us $12,500 to start. We rebuild everything — actually better, because we're not using a proprietary CMS that holds you hostage. WordPress. You own it. Forever. No more monthly rent.*
>
> *That investment pays for itself in 5 months of what you're already spending. After that, it's pure savings — $36,000 a year, every year, that stays in your pocket instead of going to Scorpion.*
>
> *This isn't a new investment. It's redirected spend. You're already writing this check. You're just writing it to the wrong people."*

### What We Migrate

| Migration Element | What We Do |
|---|---|
| **Content** | Every page of content transferred, improved, and SEO-optimized on the new site |
| **Images & Media** | All photos, videos, and assets migrated and properly optimized |
| **SEO Equity** | Comprehensive 301 redirect map — every old URL points to the new one. No lost rankings. |
| **Google Business Profile** | Re-linked to new site, updated, optimized |
| **Google Search Console** | Transferred to new property, sitemap resubmitted |
| **Google Analytics** | New GA4 property with clean setup (old data preserved if accessible) |
| **Reviews & Testimonials** | All review content migrated and displayed with proper schema |
| **Blog Posts** | Historical blog content migrated, reformatted, and internally linked |
| **Contact/Lead Data** | Any accessible lead or form data exported before cancellation |

### The "Vendor Firing" Service

**This is a huge differentiator. Lawyers hate confrontation with their vendors (ironic, but true).**

What we handle:
1. **Cancellation letter** — We draft it, they sign it, we send it
2. **Contract review** — We identify any early termination fees or gotchas
3. **Transition timeline** — We manage the overlap period so there's zero downtime
4. **DNS management** — We handle the technical transfer of their domain
5. **Data extraction** — We pull everything we can before the old vendor shuts off access
6. **Post-cancellation verification** — We confirm old vendor has actually stopped billing

**How to position it:**
> *"I know firing your current agency is a headache you don't want to deal with. So we do it for you. We draft the cancellation letter, manage the transition timeline, and make sure there's zero downtime. You sign one letter and never think about [Scorpion/FindLaw/whoever] again."*

### Vendor-Specific Liberation Playbooks

#### Scorpion Clients
- **Their pain:** $3,000-$10,000/mo, proprietary CMS, multi-year contracts, serve their competitors
- **Our pitch:** "You're paying $36K-$120K/year for a website you'll never own. Give us $15K once. Done."
- **Migration note:** Scorpion sites use proprietary CMS — content must be scraped/rebuilt, not transferred. We handle this.
- **Watch for:** Early termination fees in their contract. Factor into ROI math.

#### FindLaw Clients
- **Their pain:** Template sites, 2-year contracts, don't own content, outdated SEO
- **Our pitch:** "FindLaw charges you monthly rent for a template. We build you a custom site you own forever for less than one year of FindLaw."
- **Migration note:** FindLaw content is often templated — we rewrite rather than migrate. SEO value is usually minimal.
- **Watch for:** Content ownership clauses — FindLaw sometimes claims ownership of content they wrote.

#### Generic Agency Clients
- **Their pain:** Slow delivery, vanity metrics, no PI expertise, overcharging
- **Our pitch:** "Your agency doesn't understand PI law. We do. Your agency serves 50 industries. We serve one. Your agency took 4 months. We take 30 days."
- **Migration note:** WordPress-to-WordPress migrations are straightforward. Other CMS platforms vary.

### The Budget Redirect Framework

**Key principle: Frame every dollar as redirected spend, not new spend.**

| Their Current Spend | Our One-Time Investment | Break-Even | Annual Savings After Year 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| $1,500/mo ($18K/yr) | $12,500 (Standard) | 8.3 months | $18,000/year |
| $2,000/mo ($24K/yr) | $12,500 (Standard) | 6.3 months | $24,000/year |
| $3,000/mo ($36K/yr) | $18,500 (Professional) | 6.2 months | $36,000/year |
| $5,000/mo ($60K/yr) | $27,500 (Enterprise) | 5.5 months | $60,000/year |

> *"You're not adding an expense. You're eliminating one. The one-time fee you spend with us replaces the $2,000-$5,000 you're spending every month with [vendor]. After [X] months, you're in the black — and you own the asset forever."*

---

## 3B. NEW FIRM TRACK — "BUILD IT RIGHT FROM DAY ONE"

### For Prospects With No Existing Website

Not every prospect is escaping a bad vendor. Some are brand new — just passed the bar, just opened their shingle, just left a big firm to go solo. They don't have a website yet, and they need one yesterday.

**This is a parallel track to the liberation narrative.** Same pricing, same deliverables, same guarantees — just different positioning.

### The Narrative

**Liberation track (existing site):** *"Stop renting. Own it. Fire your vendor."*
**New firm track (no existing site):** *"Build your digital foundation from day one — so you never have to switch."*

> *"Most of our clients come to us because they're trapped with a bad vendor — paying monthly rent for a website they don't own. We help them escape. But for new firms, we have an even better opportunity: we build it right from the start. No migration needed. No bad habits to undo. No SEO equity to salvage from a broken site. Just a clean, professional, conversion-optimized web presence built on infrastructure you own — from day one."*

### What Changes (and What Doesn't)

| Element | Liberation Track (Existing Site) | New Firm Track (No Existing Site) |
|---------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Pricing** | Same ($12,500 / $18,500 / $27,500) | Same ($12,500 / $18,500 / $27,500) |
| **Page count basis** | Based on existing pages to rebuild | Based on pages needed (Standard = up to 20 built from scratch) |
| **Migration** | Full content migration + 301 redirects | ❌ Not needed |
| **Vendor cancellation** | We handle firing old vendor | ❌ Not needed |
| **Content creation** | Migrate + improve existing content | Write ALL content from scratch (more work, but cleaner) |
| **SEO foundation** | Preserve existing equity + improve | Build from zero — clean domain authority strategy |
| **GBP** | Re-link and optimize existing profile | Set up from scratch + optimize |
| **Guarantees** | All 4 guarantees apply | All 4 guarantees apply |
| **Exclusivity** | 12 months included | 12 months included |
| **Delivery** | 30-day launch process | 30-day launch process (often faster — no migration complexity) |

### Positioning on Calls

**For new firms, the savings math doesn't apply (they have no current vendor to compare against).** Instead, use the **cost-of-delay** and **do-it-right-the-first-time** frameworks:

> *"Here's what I see happen all the time: a new firm opens, they throw up a Wix site or hire their nephew to build something on Squarespace, and six months later they're frustrated because it doesn't rank, doesn't convert, and looks generic. Then they come to us and we have to undo all of that — rebuild the site, fix the SEO mess, redirect the broken URLs. It costs more and takes longer.*
>
> *You have an advantage right now: a blank slate. We can build your web presence correctly from day one — proper infrastructure, proper SEO, proper conversion optimization — so you never have to go through that painful rebuild process. Most of our clients wish they'd found us before they signed with Scorpion or FindLaw. You get to skip that entire chapter."*

**ROI framing for new firms:**
> *"One personal injury case brings in an average of $16,500 in fees. Your website investment starts at $12,500. One signed case and you've made your money back — and the website keeps working for you month after month, year after year. There is no better investment for a new PI firm than a web presence that generates its own cases."*

### Sales Script Branch Point

**Ask this early in every call (Phase 2 — Diagnose):**

> *"Do you currently have a website for your firm?"*

**If YES →** Liberation track: *"Great — who built it? How much are you paying? Do you own it?"* (Continue with standard vendor pain diagnosis)

**If NO →** New firm track: *"Perfect — that actually puts you in a great position. Most of our clients come to us after years of paying rent on a website they don't own. You get to skip all of that and build it right from the start. Let me walk you through what that looks like..."*

**If SORT OF (DIY/nephew/placeholder) →** Hybrid: *"Okay — so you have something up, but it's not really working for you. That's actually the most common situation for newer firms. We'll treat this as a fresh build — keep anything worth keeping, but start with a clean foundation."*

---

## 4. GUARANTEES

### The Guarantee Stack

Stack multiple guarantees to eliminate every possible objection. This is the single biggest differentiator vs. every competitor — **no agency in this space offers guarantees like these.**

---

#### GUARANTEE #1: "On-Time or It's Free"
**Type:** Delivery guarantee (unconditional)

**The promise:** "Your website will be live and fully functional within 30 days of our kickoff call. If we miss that deadline, the entire project is free."

**Why it works:**
- No competitor offers a delivery guarantee — most take 6-16 weeks
- Eliminates the #2 lawyer complaint: "It took 4 months to get my website live"
- Forces urgency and signals operational confidence
- Risk is VERY LOW — with our proprietary build process, we typically deliver in 2-3 weeks

**Fine print (protect yourself):**
- Clock starts after kickoff call AND receipt of first payment
- Client must provide photos, logo, and bio info within 48 hours of kickoff
- Client must provide current vendor login credentials within 48 hours
- Review feedback must be returned within 48 hours
- "Business days" = Monday-Friday, excludes federal holidays
- Force majeure clause for things genuinely outside your control
- Delays caused by old vendor non-cooperation extend the timeline

**How to say it on a call:** *"We guarantee your website is live within 30 days of kickoff or the entire project is free. Most of our clients are live in 2-3 weeks. We've never missed a deadline."*

#### GUARANTEE #2: 30-Day Unconditional Satisfaction Guarantee
**Type:** Unconditional money-back

**The promise:** "If at any point in the first 30 days after launch you're not thrilled with your website — for any reason — we'll refund your full investment. No questions asked. No hoops. No awkward conversations."

**Why it works:**
- Eliminates the "what if I don't like it?" fear completely
- Signals extreme confidence in the product
- Addresses the #1 PI lawyer fear: "I've been burned before and lost money"
- Unconditional guarantees increase conversion by 20-30% in professional services (Hormozi data)

**Risk mitigation:**
- At 80%+ gross margin, even a 10% refund rate keeps you profitable
- In practice, refund rates on done-for-you websites are <5% when quality is high
- The guarantee itself filters out bad-fit clients — tire-kickers rarely commit even with a guarantee

**How to say it on a call:** *"And look — if you don't love it, you get your money back. Full refund in the first 30 days, no questions asked. I can offer that because I've never had a client ask for one."*

---

#### GUARANTEE #3: 90-Day Performance Guarantee (Conditional)
**Type:** Conditional performance guarantee

**The promise:** "If your new website doesn't generate at least 10 qualified leads in the first 90 days, we'll continue working on your site — adding content, optimizing SEO, improving conversion — at no additional cost for up to 90 additional days until you hit that number."

**Why it works:**
- Ties the guarantee to business outcomes, not vanity metrics
- "Qualified leads" = contact form submissions, phone calls from potential clients (not spam, not existing clients, not solicitors)
- Addresses the "how do I know it'll actually work?" objection
- Competitors offer ZERO performance guarantees

**Definition of "qualified lead":**
- A contact form submission or phone call from a potential client seeking PI legal services
- Lead must originate from one of these qualifying sources: **organic search (Google, Bing), Google Business Profile, legal directories (Avvo, Justia, FindLaw directory, etc.), or AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews)**
- Tracked via Google Analytics, call tracking, and contact form data
- NOT: spam, robocalls, existing clients, solicitors, wrong numbers, paid ad leads, referral leads
- Client must have Google Analytics and call tracking active (we set this up at launch)

**Client cooperation requirements (ALL must be met for guarantee to apply):**
- Client must keep the website live and unmodified — no removing CTAs, no changing copy, no installing unapproved plugins or themes without our written approval
- Client must maintain an **active, verified Google Business Profile** throughout the 90-day period
- Client must **respond to all leads within 24 hours** — we can't guarantee lead generation if prospects are being ghosted (tracked via form notifications and call logs)
- Client must not redirect, block, or alter the site's analytics or call tracking setup
- Applies to all tiers (every client gets the full stack)

**Cap on free work (protects our exposure):**
- If 10 qualified leads are not reached within 90 days of launch, we continue optimization work for up to **90 additional days** (total maximum exposure: **180 days from launch**)
- If 10 leads are still not reached after the additional 90 days AND all client cooperation requirements have been met, we will conduct a final performance audit and deliver a written action plan — but our obligation under this guarantee ends at day 180
- In practice, this cap will almost never be hit — 10 leads in 180 days is an extremely low bar for a properly optimized PI site in any metro area

**How to say it on a call:** *"Here's where we really put our money where our mouth is. If your site doesn't generate at least 10 qualified leads — real potential clients finding you through Google, your Google Business Profile, legal directories, or AI search — in the first 90 days, we keep working for free for up to another 90 days until you hit that number. All we ask is that you keep your Google Business Profile active, respond to leads within 24 hours, and don't modify the site without checking with us first. That's it. We track everything: calls, forms, chats. You'll see exactly where your leads are coming from."*

---

#### GUARANTEE #4: Full Asset Ownership
**Type:** Implied/structural guarantee

**The promise:** "You own everything. Your website, your domain, your content, your code, your analytics accounts, your ad accounts. Everything is built on Cloudflare, hosted on your hosting account, and registered under your name. If you ever want to leave, you take everything with you. No exit fees. No hostage situations. No proprietary CMS lock-in."

**Why it works:**
- Directly addresses the #1 thing that pisses off PI lawyers about marketing agencies (Scorpion, FindLaw hostage horror stories)
- 100% of competitor teardown research shows this is a massive pain point
- Every lawyer who's been with Scorpion or FindLaw will immediately feel the relief

**How to say it on a call:** *"Unlike Scorpion or FindLaw, you own everything from day one. Your website, your domain, your analytics — it's all yours. If you ever want to take it to another agency or manage it yourself, you walk away with everything. We don't hold websites hostage. In fact, that's why most of our clients come to us — to escape vendors who do."*

## 5. GEOGRAPHIC EXCLUSIVITY

### The #1 Differentiator — Lead With This

**The Rule:** We only work with ONE personal injury law firm per practice area per metropolitan area. Once your market is taken, your competitors cannot hire us. Period.

**This is the primary reason to buy. Lead with it on every call. Before price, before features, before anything.**

### Why This Works (Backed by Research)

1. **Lawyers understand conflicts of interest.** They deal with conflicts daily in their own practice. Geographic exclusivity is immediately credible and valued.

2. **It creates genuine, ethical scarcity.** You legitimately cannot rank two competing PI firms in the same market. This is real, not manufactured urgency.

3. **It transforms the sales dynamic.** Instead of "convince me to buy," it becomes **"am I too late?"** The prospect is now competing for YOUR service, not the other way around.

4. **It justifies premium pricing.** Research shows lawyers accept a 20-30% price premium for market exclusivity without pushback — because the alternative (their competitor getting the advantage) feels worse.

5. **Rankings.io built a $10M+ agency on this exact model.** It works at premium prices.

### How to Position It

**OPEN every call with this:**
> *"Before we go into anything else, I need to check something — we only work with one PI firm per metro area. If someone in your market has already signed with us, I can't take this call any further. Let me check... [pause] ...good news, [City] is still open. But I should tell you, we're in conversations with [X number] other firms in your area. That's actually why I wanted to connect with you sooner rather than later."*

**Key language:**
- "Once your market is taken, we can't work with your competitors"
- "Your competitor literally cannot hire us to do what we'd do for you"
- "We treat your market like you treat your client conflicts — exclusive"
- "This isn't a fake countdown timer. This is a real constraint."
- "Scorpion works with your competitors at the same time. We literally can't."
- "Your first 12 months of exclusivity are included with the website. After that, staying on our SEO retainer keeps the lock on your market — and keeps your competitors out."

**In proposals:**
Include a section titled **"Market Exclusivity Agreement"** that states:
- Kurios Brand will not provide website design or SEO services to any other personal injury law firm in [defined metro area]
- The exclusivity applies to the practice area of personal injury law specifically
- **12 months of geographic exclusivity are INCLUDED with the website purchase** — starts from launch date
- After 12 months, exclusivity is maintained as long as the client has an **active SEO retainer** with Kurios Brand
- If the client cancels their SEO retainer after month 12, exclusivity continues for a **90-day grace period** from the cancellation date, then expires
- If a client never signs an SEO retainer, exclusivity expires 12 months after website launch
- Define geographic boundaries clearly (metro area, not just city limits)

### Exclusivity + Retainer Retention Model

**How it works:**

| Timeline | Exclusivity Status | What's Required |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Months 1-12** (from launch) | ✅ Active — included with website purchase | Nothing extra. Included. |
| **Month 13+** (with active retainer) | ✅ Active — maintained by retainer | Active SEO retainer ($5,000-$7,500/mo) |
| **After retainer cancellation** | ⏳ 90-day grace period | Nothing — but clock is ticking |
| **90 days post-cancellation** | ❌ Expired | Market opens to competitors |

**Why this structure works:**
- **Not coercive** — they get a full 12 months of exclusivity just for buying the website. No one can say they were pressured.
- **Natural retention incentive** — after year 1, continuing the retainer keeps their market locked. Losing exclusivity means their competitor could hire us. That's a real consequence, not a manufactured one.
- **90-day grace period is generous** — if they need to pause for cash flow reasons, they have 3 months to re-activate without losing their market.
- **Creates urgency to start the retainer** — when you pitch the retainer at month 2-3, you can frame it as "this also locks in your exclusivity beyond the first year."

**How to position on calls (after closing the website):**
> *"One more thing — your geographic exclusivity is included for the first 12 months. After that, maintaining it is simple: stay on our SEO retainer, and your market stays locked. If you ever cancel the retainer, you get a 90-day grace period before the exclusivity expires. We're not trying to trap you — we're giving you the tools to keep your competitors out. The retainer makes your site better AND keeps your market exclusive. It's the smart play."*

**How to position during retainer upsell (month 2-3):**
> *"Remember the market exclusivity you got with the website? That's included for your first 12 months. After that, the exclusivity is tied to your retainer. So by signing up for the SEO retainer now, you're not just investing in rankings — you're locking your competitors out of working with us for as long as you're a client. It's a two-for-one."*

### Pricing the Exclusivity

**Primary model (Recommended):** 12 months included with website purchase, ongoing exclusivity tied to active SEO retainer. This is the default — don't charge separately. The exclusivity is part of what makes the $12,500+ valuable AND creates the natural bridge to recurring revenue.

**For high-value markets (Optional add-on):** Add a 20-30% exclusivity premium for top-50 metro areas where PI competition is fiercest. $12,500 → $15,600-$16,250 (Standard), $18,500 → $23,100-$24,000 (Professional) for markets like Houston, Miami, Phoenix, Atlanta, Dallas.

### Markets to Prioritize (High PI Concentration)

Focus on metros with high car accident rates AND high PI firm density:
- Texas: Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin
- Florida: Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville
- California: Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento
- Georgia: Atlanta
- Arizona: Phoenix
- Illinois: Chicago
- Nevada: Las Vegas
- North Carolina: Charlotte, Raleigh

### Creating the "Am I Too Late?" Dynamic

**Marketing tactics:**
- Post on LinkedIn: "Just locked out the Dallas PI market. 3 remaining spots in Texas."
- Email nurture sequence: "Your market is still available, but we're in conversations with [X] firms in [City]."
- On your website: Show a map or list of "markets currently served" (even early on, this signals scarcity)
- On sales calls: Always check availability as if it might already be taken

## 6. PAYMENT STRUCTURE

### Default: 50/50 Split

| Payment | Amount (Standard) | When |
|---------|-------------------|------|
| **Payment 1** | $6,250 | Due at contract signing (before kickoff call) |
| **Payment 2** | $6,250 | Due on launch day |

**Why 50/50 works:**
- $6,250 is psychologically easier than $12,500 — cuts the initial commitment in half
- First payment covers your production costs with margin to spare
- Second payment provides incentive for YOU to deliver on time
- Lawyers are familiar with retainer + completion billing from their own practices

**How to present it:**
> *"Most of our clients do the 50/50 split — $7,500 to get started, $7,500 when we launch. That way, you're not paying the full amount until you've seen the final product. And remember — this replaces what you're paying monthly right now. Think of it as 2-3 months of your current vendor bill, except you own it forever."*

### Alternative: 3-Payment Plan

| Payment | Amount | When |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Payment 1** | $5,400 | At contract signing |
| **Payment 2** | $5,400 | At website review |
| **Payment 3** | $5,400 | 30 days after launch |
| **Total** | **$16,200** | 8% financing premium |

**Why charge an 8% premium:**
- Compensates for delayed cash flow
- Standard practice in professional services
- 3 × $4,500 = $13,500 vs. $12,500 flat — framed as a convenience fee, not interest
- Lawyers understand time-value of money

**How to present it:**
> *"We also have a three-payment option if that's easier for your cash flow. It's $5,400 at signing, $5,400 at review, and $5,400 thirty days after launch. There's a small convenience fee built in, but some of our clients prefer spreading it out."*

**Then immediately redirect:** *"But honestly, the 50/50 is the best value — and most clients go that route."*

### Payment Methods
- ACH/wire transfer (preferred — no processing fees)
- Credit card (accepted — factor in ~3% processing fee)
- Check (accepted but slow — only for clients who insist)

### All Tiers — Payment Summary

| Tier | Full Price | 50/50 Split | 3-Payment Plan |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Standard | $12,500 | $6,250 + $6,250 | $4,500 × 3 = $13,500 |
| Professional | $18,500 | $9,250 + $9,250 | $6,660 × 3 = $19,980 |
| Enterprise | $27,500 | $13,750 + $13,750 | $9,900 × 3 = $29,700 |

---

### Monthly SEO Retainer

**This is where the real recurring revenue lives.** The website is the door-opener. The retainer is the business.

#### SEO Retainer Tiers

| Retainer | Monthly Price | What's Included |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Growth** | $5,000/mo | 4 blog posts/month (1,500+ words, keyword-targeted), monthly GBP posts, citation monitoring, active link building, monthly analytics report, monthly strategy call |
| **Accelerator** | $6,250/mo | Everything in Growth PLUS 6 blog posts/month, advanced link building campaign, competitor monitoring, bi-weekly reporting, bi-monthly strategy calls, review generation system |
| **Domination** | $7,500/mo | Everything in Accelerator PLUS local landing pages, advanced review generation, premium link building, AI visibility monitoring & optimization, weekly reporting, weekly strategy calls, priority support |

**Annual framing (use this):**
> *"A Standard website plus our Growth SEO retainer is $72,500 for the first year. That's mid-tier agency territory — except you own the website, you get exclusivity, and you can cancel any month. The Domination retainer puts you at $105,000/year — that's Rankings.io territory at a fraction of their price, with more flexibility."*

| Package | Year 1 Total | Monthly Equivalent | Comparable Agency Cost |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Standard + Growth | $12,500 + $60,000 = **$72,500** | ~$6,040/mo | Scorpion: $36K-$120K/yr |
| Professional + Accelerator | $18,500 + $75,000 = **$93,500** | ~$7,790/mo | PaperStreet: $50K-$100K/yr |
| Professional + Domination | $18,500 + $90,000 = **$108,500** | ~$9,040/mo | Rankings.io: $50K-$200K/yr |
| Enterprise + Domination | $27,500 + $90,000 = **$117,500** | ~$9,790/mo | Premium agency territory |

**When to introduce the retainer:**
- NOT on the first sales call — close the website first
- Mention it casually during kickoff: "Once the site is live, we'll talk about keeping the SEO momentum going."
- Formally pitch at the site review or within 30 days of launch
- The 90-day content calendar included in Standard/Professional naturally leads into "who's going to execute this?" → you

**Terms:**
- Month-to-month. No long-term contracts. (This is a massive competitive advantage — say it loud.)
- 30-day notice to cancel
- "If we're not delivering, fire us. We'll make it easy. Unlike your last vendor."

## 7. SALES FRAMEWORK

### The Call Structure

**Total time: 30-45 minutes.** PI lawyers are busy. Don't waste their time.

**Core principle: Lead with "you're already spending this money."** This is not a new investment conversation. This is a "redirect your existing spend" conversation.

#### Phase 1: Exclusivity Check + Build Rapport (5-7 min)

**OPEN WITH EXCLUSIVITY — before anything else:**
> *"Before we dive in, I need to check something. We only work with one PI firm per metro area — it's how we avoid conflicts of interest. Let me make sure [City] is still available... [pause] ...okay, you're good. [City] is still open. But I should mention, we've been talking to another firm there, so I wanted to connect with you while it's still available."*

**Then rapport:**
> *"Tell me about your firm — how long have you been practicing PI? What does your caseload look like right now?"*

#### Phase 2: Diagnose the Situation (8-10 min)

**This is the key phase. Lead with their CURRENT situation, not your offer.**

**START with the branch question:**
> *"Do you currently have a website for your firm?"*

**If YES → Liberation track (vendor pain diagnosis):**
> *"Who built your current website? Do you have an agency or vendor managing it?"*
> *"How much are you paying them per month?"*
> *"Do you know if you own your website? Like, if you stopped paying them tomorrow, would you keep the site?"*
> *"Have you tried to leave before? What happened?"*
> *"How are you currently getting cases? Referrals? Google? Ads?"*

**If NO → New firm track:**
> *"Perfect — that actually puts you in a great position. Most of our clients come to us after years of paying rent on a website they don't own. You get to skip all of that and build it right from the start. Tell me about your firm — how long have you been practicing? What's your caseload look like right now? What's your main source of cases today — referrals?"*

**If SORT OF (DIY/basic site):**
> *"Okay — so you have something up, but is it really working for you? Getting you cases? ...Right. We'll treat this as a fresh build — keep anything worth keeping, but start with a proper foundation."*

**Listen for these triggers:**
1. **Paying $1,500-$5,000+/mo for a site they don't own** → The DREAM prospect. This is your money-in-the-bank lead. (Liberation track)
2. **Locked in a contract** → Identify termination date, help them plan the switch (Liberation track)
3. **Just fired an agency** → Ready NOW, but skeptical. Lead with guarantees. (Liberation track)
4. **Frustrated with results** → "Paying for rankings that never come" (Liberation track)
5. **Competitor is winning** → FOMO-driven urgency (Either track)
6. **Starting a new firm / no website** → Need presence IMMEDIATELY (New firm track)

**When they mention a bad vendor experience (and they will):**
> *"I hear that from almost every PI lawyer I talk to. The legal marketing industry has a real trust problem — between Scorpion holding websites hostage and FindLaw charging monthly rent for templates you don't own, most lawyers I talk to feel like they've been taken for a ride. That's literally why we exist."*

#### Phase 3: The Savings Math (5-7 min)

**This replaces the old "present the opportunity" phase. Don't pitch a new investment — show them the money they're already wasting.**

> *"So you're paying [vendor] $[X] per month. That's $[X×12] per year. How long have you been with them? [Y years]? So you've spent roughly $[X×12×Y] with them total.*
>
> *Now here's the question that should make you angry: if you stopped paying them tomorrow, what do you keep?*
>
> *[They'll say "nothing" or "I don't know"]*
>
> *Right. So you've spent $[total] renting a website. You don't own the design. You probably don't own the content. Some of these vendors don't even let you keep your domain.*
>
> *Here's what we do differently. $12,500 starting. We rebuild your website — actually better than what you have now, because we're building it on infrastructure you own. We migrate all your content, preserve your SEO rankings with proper redirects, and we even handle the cancellation with your current vendor.*
>
> *That investment pays for itself in [X÷monthly] months of what you're already spending. After that? Every dollar you used to send to [vendor] stays in your pocket. Or you reinvest it in SEO that actually works — with us, month-to-month, cancel anytime."*

#### Phase 4: Present the Offer — Anchor High (8-10 min)

**START WITH ENTERPRISE ($27,500):**

> *"Let me walk you through what we'd build for you. Our most comprehensive package is the Enterprise at $27,500. This includes..."*

[Walk through the full Enterprise feature list. Let it breathe. Let them feel the scope.]

> *"That said, most of our clients — about 70% — go with the Professional at $18,500. It has everything you need to start generating cases: the custom design, the practice area pages, the local SEO, the competitor analysis, the case value calculator, full migration from your current site, and we handle the vendor cancellation. The main difference is the blog articles and video scripts in Enterprise — which are valuable, but you can always add those later."*

> *"And if you need a clean, professional presence fast, the Standard at $12,500 gets you a 5-page site with full migration."*

**Pause. Let them self-select.** Most solo/small firms land at Standard ($12,500).

#### Phase 5: Stack the Guarantees (3-5 min)

> *"Now here's what really sets us apart — because I know you've been burned before.*
>
> *First: your website goes live within 30 days or it's free. We've never missed a deadline. Most clients are live in 2-3 weeks.*
>
> *Second: 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you don't love it — for any reason — full refund. No hoops.*
>
> *Third: 90-day performance guarantee. If your site doesn't generate at least 10 qualified leads — from Google, your Business Profile, directories, AI search — in the first 90 days, we keep working on it at no additional cost for up to another 90 days until it does. All we ask is you keep your GBP active and respond to leads promptly.*
>
> *And fourth: you own everything. Your website, your domain, your content, your data. No proprietary CMS. No hostage situations. That alone is worth the switch from wherever you are now."*

**Let it land.** This is your closing sequence. These guarantees address every major objection PI lawyers have.

#### Phase 6: Close (3-5 min)

**The soft close:**
> *"So based on everything we talked about — especially the savings from getting off [current vendor] — which tier feels like the right fit for your firm?"*

**If they hesitate:**
> *"Remember — we only work with one PI firm per metro area. [City] is still available right now, but that other firm I mentioned is making their decision this week. I don't say that to pressure you — it's just the reality of how we operate."*

**If they want to "think about it":**
> *"Totally understand. What specifically do you want to think through? Is it the investment, the timing, or something else? Because remember — every month you stay with [vendor] is another $[X] for a site you'll never own."*

**When they say yes:**
> *"Great. Here's how it works: I'll send over a simple agreement and invoice for the first payment. Once that's done, we'll get your kickoff call scheduled — usually within 48 hours. We'll need your current vendor login info so we can start the migration audit. And within 30 days, you're live on a site you own — and we've handled firing [vendor] for you."*

### Objection Handlers — Top 6

#### OBJECTION 1: "I already have a website/vendor" ← THIS IS NOW A STRENGTH

**This is your #1 opportunity. Every lawyer with a current vendor is a migration prospect.**

> *"Perfect — that's actually exactly who we built this for. Can I ask you a few questions about your current setup?*
>
> *How much are you paying per month? [Usually $1,500-$5,000]*
> *Do you own the website? Like, if you stopped paying tomorrow, do you keep it? [Usually no]*
> *Are they working with other PI firms in your market? [Usually yes, or they don't know]*
> *How long did it take them to build your current site? [Usually months]*
>
> *Here's what I'm hearing: you're paying $[X] per month — that's $[X×12] per year — for a website you don't own, built by a company that probably works with your competitors.*
>
> *What we do is migrate you off that platform entirely. We rebuild your site on WordPress — which you own forever — migrate all your content and SEO equity with proper redirects so you don't lose any rankings, and we even handle the cancellation with your current vendor. We draft the letter, manage the transition, handle the DNS.*
>
> *The one-time investment pays for itself in [X÷monthly] months of what you're already spending. After that, you never pay rent on your website again.*
>
> *This isn't a question of whether you can afford it. It's a question of how much longer you want to keep paying for something you'll never own."*

#### OBJECTION 2: "I've been burned by agencies before"

**This is THE most common objection. 74% of law firms believe they've wasted money on marketing.**

> *"I hear that from almost every PI lawyer I talk to. You're not alone — the legal marketing industry has a serious trust problem. Scorpion locks you into contracts and holds your website hostage. FindLaw charges you monthly for a template you don't own. Generic agencies promise rankings they can't deliver.*
>
> *That's exactly why we structured this the way we did. You own everything — your site, your domain, all your content. Full satisfaction guarantee — if you don't love it, full refund. Geographic exclusivity — we literally can't work with your competitors. And the monthly SEO retainer is month-to-month — no long-term contracts. If we're not delivering, fire us. We make it easy. Unlike your last vendor.*
>
> *The question isn't whether you need marketing — you know you do. The question is whether you've found someone who'll actually deliver and not hold you hostage. I'm happy to send you references from PI firms we've worked with so you can hear it from them directly."*

#### OBJECTION 3: "It's too expensive"

> *"I totally get that. Let me reframe it though.*
>
> *How much are you paying your current vendor per month? [$X/mo]*
>
> *So that's $[X×12] per year for a site you don't own. If you've been with them [Y] years, you've spent $[total] renting a website.*
>
> *Our Standard package starts at $12,500 one time. You own it forever. That replaces your $[X] monthly payment — you break even in [months] months. After that, it's pure savings.*
>
> *And think about it this way: one PI case brings in $16,500 in fees on average. The website starts at $12,500. One additional signed case and you've made your money back. But it won't bring you one case — a properly optimized PI website generates leads month after month, for years.*
>
> *Compare that to the alternatives: Scorpion charges $3,000-$10,000 per month and you don't own anything. Google Ads costs $100-$250 per click. A traditional agency charges $15,000-$30,000 and takes 3-4 months.*
>
> *We're delivering premium quality in 30 days starting at $12,500, you own the asset forever, and we handle firing your current vendor. It's not an expense — it's a savings.*
>
> *And we offer a 50/50 split — $7,500 now, $7,500 on delivery — if that makes the cash flow easier."*

#### OBJECTION 4: "I need to think about it"

> *"Absolutely — I don't want you to rush into anything. Can I ask what specifically you want to think through? Is it the investment, the timing, or is there something about the offer itself you're not sure about?"*

**Then address the specific concern.** "Thinking about it" is never the real objection — it's a proxy for something else. Common real objections:
- **Money:** → Offer the 50/50 split, reiterate the savings math (this replaces current spend)
- **Spouse/partner buy-in:** → Offer to do a brief call with both
- **Timing:** → "Every month you stay with [vendor] is another $[X] for a site you'll never own. That's $[X] walking out the door while you think about it."
- **Don't trust you yet:** → Offer references, send portfolio, offer the free audit first

**The scarcity nudge (use carefully, only when true):**
> *"Totally fair. I should mention that [City] is still open right now, but I am in conversations with another firm in your market. I don't want you to feel pressured — but I also don't want you to miss the window. And every month you wait is another $[X] to [vendor] for a site you don't own."*

#### OBJECTION 5: "How is this different from every other agency?"

> *"Great question. Here's the short version:*
>
> *Exclusivity: We only work with one PI firm per market. Your competitors literally cannot hire us. That's in the contract. No other agency offers that — Scorpion works with dozens of PI firms in the same city.*
>
> *Ownership: You own everything. No proprietary CMS, no lock-in. your site, your domain, your content. If you ever leave, it all goes with you.*
>
> *Migration: We don't just build you a new site — we migrate everything from your current one. Content, SEO equity, redirects. And we fire your current vendor for you.*
>
> *Speed: 30-day launch process. Most of our clients are live in 2-3 weeks. Industry standard is 6-16 weeks.*
>
> *Guarantees: 30-day satisfaction guarantee, 90-day performance guarantee, on-time delivery guarantee. No other agency in this space stacks guarantees like that because most of them can't.*
>
> *Month-to-month: Our SEO retainer has no long-term contract. If we're not delivering, fire us. Unlike [their vendor].*
>
> *And here's the big one: we report on cases and cost per case. Not traffic, not impressions, not keyword rankings. Signed cases. That's the only number that matters."*

#### OBJECTION 6: "My current vendor offered to match/beat your price to keep me"

**Frequency:** Expect this on 20-30% of calls. The moment a lawyer tells their current vendor they're leaving, the vendor will panic and counter-offer — discounts, free months, new features, matching your price. This is predictable and you should preempt it.

**Core principle: Don't compete on price. Compete on ownership and freedom.** A discount on a cage is still a cage.

> *"I hear this a lot — and honestly, I'd be surprised if they DIDN'T offer you a deal to stay. Think about it: you're a recurring revenue client paying them $[X] per month. Of course they're going to fight to keep you.*
>
> *But here's the thing — before you take that deal, ask them three questions:*
>
> *One: Will they give you the WordPress files and full source code so you own the website outright? Not 'access' — actual ownership, exportable files, on your hosting.*
>
> *Two: Will they let you own your domain 100% — registered under your name, at your registrar, with your login? Not managed by them. Owned by you.*
>
> *Three: Will they stop working with your competitors in your market? Not a soft promise — a contractual guarantee that no other PI firm in [City] gets their services.*
>
> *If the answer to any of those is no — and it will be — then what they're really offering you is a discount to stay locked in. A cheaper cage is still a cage.*
>
> *Our deal doesn't change based on what they offer. Our deal is: you own everything, we work exclusively with you in your market, and if you ever want to leave us, you walk away with your entire website. We don't need to counter-offer because we don't hold anything hostage in the first place."*

**Pre-empt it on the call (recommended):**
> *"One thing I should mention — when you tell your current vendor you're leaving, they're going to offer you a discount. Maybe a free month, maybe a price match. It happens every time. When it does, just ask yourself: is the discount solving the actual problem? Do you now own the site? Do they now have exclusivity? Or are they just charging you less for the same situation you wanted to leave?"*

**If they push back ("but the discount is really good"):**
> *"I get it — saving money feels good. But let me ask you this: if the service was worth what they were charging, why are they suddenly able to do it for less? Either they were overcharging you before, or they're going to cut corners now. Neither is a great sign.*
>
> *And here's the real question: in 12 months, when that discount expires — and it will — are you going to be in the same position? Still paying monthly rent, still not owning your site, still watching them work with your competitors? Because we solve that permanently. One time. And you own everything."*

---

#### OBJECTION 7: "I'm locked in a contract with my current vendor"

> *"That actually comes up a lot. Here's what we typically do:*
>
> *First, when does your contract expire? [Get the date]*
>
> *Okay, so here's the play: we start building your new site now, on our timeline. When your contract is up, we flip the switch — your new site goes live, old site goes dark, and you're free. Zero gap, zero downtime.*
>
> *In the meantime, the savings math still works. If your contract ends in [X] months and you're paying $[Y]/mo, that's $[total] more to [vendor]. After that, you're paying us $15,000 once and owning it forever vs. continuing to pay $[Y]/mo indefinitely for something you'll never own.*
>
> *Some of our clients even find that paying the early termination fee is worth it when you do the math. If the ETF is $3,000 but you're saving $[Y]/mo going forward, it pays for itself in [months]. We'll review your contract and help you figure out the smartest move."*

---

### Additional Sales Talking Points

**When they ask "Why 30 days?":**
> *"We've invested heavily in proprietary systems that let us move faster than traditional agencies. Content generation, design systems, SEO frameworks — we've streamlined every step. A traditional agency takes 6-16 weeks because they're billing by the hour and juggling multiple projects. We have a dedicated launch process that gets you live in 30 days. Honestly, most of our clients are done in 2-3 weeks — but we build in buffer for the migration and review process."*

**When they ask "Is it really custom?":**
> *"100%. We don't use templates. We design around your firm's branding, your practice areas, your local market. No two sites look the same. I can show you our portfolio if you'd like to see the range."*

**When they ask "What about ongoing SEO?":**
> *"The website we build has a strong SEO foundation — schema markup, keyword-targeted content, speed optimization. But SEO is a long game. The site will start attracting organic traffic, but to really dominate your market, you'll want ongoing content and link building. We offer month-to-month SEO retainers starting at $5,000/month — no contracts, cancel anytime. But let's get your site live first and then we can talk about the best strategy for your market."*

**When they ask about the technology:**
> *"We use proprietary systems that let us deliver premium quality faster than anyone else. It's the same quality you'd get from a $50K agency build — we just have better tools and more efficient processes. Every piece of content is reviewed and refined by humans who understand PI law and SEO strategy. You get premium agency quality at a fraction of the timeline."*

## 8. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### The One-Liner

> **"Own your website. Own your market. Fire your vendor. We handle everything."**

### How We Differ From EVERY Competitor

| Competitor Type | Their Problem | Our Advantage |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Scorpion** | $3K-$10K/mo, proprietary CMS, holds website hostage, multi-year contracts, works with your competitors | You own everything. Month-to-month. Market exclusivity. One-time fee. We migrate you off Scorpion. |
| **FindLaw** | Template sites, 2-year contracts, you don't own content, outdated SEO, $6K-$60K total cost | Custom design. 30-day delivery. You own everything. Better SEO. We handle the cancellation. |
| **Rankings.io** | $50K-$200K/year, 8-16 week builds, only serves mid-to-large firms | Same PI expertise. Fraction of the cost. Faster delivery. Accessible to solos and small firms. |
| **PaperStreet** | $9,500-$40K+, 6-12 week delivery, no performance guarantee | Comparable quality. 30 days vs 12 weeks. Triple guarantee stack. Full migration included. |
| **DIY builders** (Wix, Squarespace) | Generic templates, zero SEO strategy, no legal expertise, time-consuming | Done-for-you. PI-specific. SEO-optimized. Under 1 hour of your time. |
| **Cheap freelancers** ($1K-$3K) | No strategy, no SEO, template modifications, no support, no migration | Strategy-driven. Full SEO. Custom design. Full migration. 60-90 day support. Guarantees. |
| **Generic agencies** | Don't understand PI law, no exclusivity, vanity metrics, slow delivery | PI-focused. Market exclusive. Case-based reporting. 30-day delivery. Vendor migration. |

### The "Liberation" Positioning

**This is your core narrative. Own it.**

Most PI lawyers are trapped. They're paying monthly rent for websites they don't own, locked into contracts with vendors who serve their competitors, and getting generic work from agencies that don't understand PI law.

**Your positioning statement:**
> *"We exist because the legal marketing industry holds lawyers hostage. We saw firms paying $3,000-$10,000 per month for websites they'll never own, locked into contracts with vendors who work with their competitors, getting template work passed off as custom.*
>
> *So we built the escape hatch: a custom website you own forever, delivered in 30 days, with full migration from your current vendor. We handle the cancellation. We preserve your SEO. We build on WordPress you control. No contracts. No proprietary CMS. No conflicts of interest. If we don't deliver, you don't pay.*
>
> *This isn't a new expense. It's the end of an old one."*

**The "anti-agency agency" framework:**
| What agencies do wrong | What we do instead |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Monthly rent for websites you don't own | One-time fee. You own it forever. |
| Proprietary CMS lock-in | WordPress — you own everything |
| Work with your competitors | 1 firm per market — contractual exclusivity |
| Report vanity metrics | Report on leads and cases |
| Take 3-6 months to deliver | 30-day launch process (usually faster) |
| No guarantees | Triple guarantee stack |
| Hide pricing | Transparent tiers |
| Generic content | PI-specific, market-specific content |
| Make it hard to leave | We make it easy. And we help you leave your current vendor. |

### Why Proprietary Technology + Human Expertise > Everything Else

**Position against pure agency:**
> *"Traditional agencies take 6-16 weeks because they're limited by human bandwidth. A designer works on your project between 4 other clients. A copywriter spends 3 days on your homepage. It's slow, it's expensive, and you're paying for their overhead — the fancy office, the account managers, the project coordinators.*
>
> *We use proprietary technology to eliminate the bottlenecks. Content production that would take a writer 40 hours takes us a fraction of that. Design systems that compress weeks into days. We're not cutting corners — we're using better tools. And everything is reviewed by humans who understand PI law, SEO, and conversion optimization."*

**Position against pure DIY:**
> *"Yes, you can use Wix or Squarespace and have a website in an hour. But it won't rank. It won't convert. It won't have schema markup or local SEO or conversion-optimized practice area pages. It'll look like every other template site — and potential clients will notice.*
>
> *Our proprietary tools are incredible for speed. But they need human strategy. Which keywords should you target? How should your practice area pages be structured for conversion? What schema markup will get you featured in local results? That's where expertise matters. We combine cutting-edge technology with human strategy to give you the best of both worlds."*

## 9. UPSELL PATH

### The Revenue Ladder

```
ENTRY: PI CaseFlow Website ($12,500 - $27,500 one-time)
                    ↓
RETAIN: Monthly SEO Retainer ($5,000 - $7,500/month)
                    ↓
EXPAND: Full Digital Marketing ($8,000 - $12,000/month)
                    ↓
ULTIMATE: MVA Lead Generation (Marko's core business — per-lead pricing)
```

### Stage 1: Website → SEO Retainer (Month 1-2)

**Conversion target:** 40-50% of website clients sign up for a monthly retainer

**When to pitch:** During the site review or within 30 days of launch. The 90-day content calendar included in Standard/Professional naturally creates the opening:

> *"So the content calendar we built has 12 blog topics mapped out for the next 90 days. These are specifically targeted at the keywords that'll drive the most case-relevant traffic in your market. Now, someone needs to actually write and publish these. You've got three options:*
>
> *One, you or someone on your team writes them — we gave you the topics, titles, and outlines.*
>
> *Two, you hire a freelance writer — make sure they understand PI law and SEO.*
>
> *Three, we handle it as part of our monthly SEO retainer. We write the content, build links, monitor your rankings, generate reviews, and send you monthly reports. Starts at $5,000/month, month-to-month, cancel anytime. Remember — you were paying $[X] per month to [old vendor] for a fraction of this. This is real SEO work that actually moves the needle."*

### Stage 2: SEO Retainer → Full Digital Marketing (Month 6-12)

Once they see SEO results (rankings improving, leads coming in), expand into:
- Google Ads management ($1,500-$3,000/mo management + ad spend)
- Social media marketing ($1,000-$2,000/mo)
- Review generation and reputation management ($500-$1,000/mo)
- Full-service retainer: $8,000-$12,000/month

### Stage 3: Full Marketing → MVA Lead Generation (Month 12+)

**This is the endgame — Marko's core business.**

Once you've built trust through the website and SEO, you have a warm relationship to introduce MVA lead gen:
> *"We've been driving organic leads to your site for [X] months now. There's another channel we specialize in that can dramatically scale your case volume: motor vehicle accident lead generation. We generate exclusive, pre-qualified MVA leads and send them directly to firms like yours. Want to hear about how that works?"*

### Year 1 LTV Math

**Conservative scenario (Standard + Growth retainer):**

| Revenue Source | Amount | When |
|---------------|--------|------|
| Website (one-time) | $12,500 | Month 1 |
| SEO Retainer ($5,000/mo × 10 months) | $50,000 | Months 3-12 |
| **Year 1 Total** | **$62,500** | |

**Moderate scenario (Professional + Accelerator retainer):**

| Revenue Source | Amount | When |
|---------------|--------|------|
| Website (one-time) | $18,500 | Month 1 |
| SEO Retainer ($6,250/mo × 10 months) | $62,500 | Months 3-12 |
| **Year 1 Total** | **$81,000** | |

**Optimistic scenario (Enterprise + Domination retainer + upsell):**

| Revenue Source | Amount | When |
|---------------|--------|------|
| Website (one-time) | $27,500 | Month 1 |
| SEO Retainer ($7,500/mo × 9 months) | $67,500 | Months 4-12 |
| Google Ads management ($2,000/mo × 6 months) | $12,000 | Months 7-12 |
| **Year 1 Total** | **$102,000** | |

**Year 2+ LTV (recurring only):**
- Growth: $60,000/year ($5,000 × 12)
- Accelerator: $75,000/year ($6,250 × 12)
- Domination: $90,000/year ($7,500 × 12)
- Full service: $96,000-$144,000/year ($8,000-$12,000 × 12)

### Revenue Projections (Portfolio)

| Clients/Month | Avg Website | Retainer Conversion (40%) | Monthly Retainer Avg | Year 1 Revenue |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 2 clients/mo | ~$16,500 avg | ~10 retainer clients/yr | $6,250/mo | $396K website + $375K retainer = **$771K** |
| 4 clients/mo | ~$16,500 avg | ~19 retainer clients/yr | $6,250/mo | $792K website + $715K retainer = **$1.51M** |
| 6 clients/mo | ~$16,500 avg | ~29 retainer clients/yr | $6,250/mo | $1.19M website + $1.09M retainer = **$2.28M** |
| 8 clients/mo | ~$16,500 avg | ~38 retainer clients/yr | $6,250/mo | $1.58M website + $1.43M retainer = **$3.01M** |

*Retainer revenue compounds — each new retainer client adds recurring monthly revenue to the existing base. At $5,000-$7,500/mo per client, even 10 retainer clients represents $50K-$75K/month in recurring revenue.*
