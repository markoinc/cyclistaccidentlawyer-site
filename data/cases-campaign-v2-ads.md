## AD 2: PRICE BREAKDOWN 💰
**Opener:** Different — educational/comparison

Here's the real math on MVA case acquisition:

**Option A: You buy leads**
100 leads × $200 = $20,000
Your team calls, qualifies, closes
~15 signed cases
Cost per case: $1,333
+ Your intake team's salary
+ Your time managing it
**Real cost: ~$2,000+ per case**

**Option B: We deliver signed cases**
You pay ~$3,000 per signed case
We fund the ads
We qualify the leads
We sign the retainer
**You just litigate**

For $1,000 more per case, you never touch intake again.

87% of partners stay past 90 days. There's a reason.

No retainers. No setup fees.

📌 **PROMPT:** Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "THE REAL MATH" in white header. CENTER: Two-column comparison. LEFT COLUMN "DIY LEADS": Calculator showing $20k spend, 15 cases, "$1,333" crossed out, "+intake salary +your time" added, final "REAL COST: $2,000+" in amber. RIGHT COLUMN "WE DELIVER": Clean "$3,000/case" in #3399FF with glow, checkmarks for "We fund ads" "We qualify" "We sign". BOTTOM: "For $1k more, never touch intake again." Sharp corners. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, soft gradients, emojis.

## AD 3: EXPOSÉ STYLE 🔥
**Opener:** Aggressive attention-grabber with emoji

🚨 PI ATTORNEYS — your lead vendor is playing you.

They buy leads from aggregators for $50.
They sell them to you for $300.
They sell the SAME lead to 3 other firms.

You're racing your competitors to the phone. Fastest dialer wins. And the vendor collects 4x.

You're not the customer. You're the product.

We don't sell leads. We deliver signed cases.

You pay for signed retainers. We handle everything else.

~$3,000 average cost per signed case
87% partner retention

No retainers. No setup fees.

Stop being the product.

📌 **PROMPT:** Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "🚨 YOUR VENDOR IS PLAYING YOU" in aggressive white font with red alert icon. CENTER: Flow diagram showing: "Aggregator $50" → "Vendor $300" → splits to "YOU + 3 OTHER FIRMS". Red "4X MARKUP" stamp. CONTRAST: Blue box below "OUR MODEL: One campaign = One firm = Your cases". BOTTOM: "Stop being the product." in white. Sharp corners. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, soft gradients.

---

## AD 4: MODEL PROBLEM
**Opener:** Different — reframes the issue

You don't have a lead problem. You have a model problem.

Buying leads and hoping your intake converts them is the same playbook firms ran in 2015.

The firms winning now aren't buying leads. They're buying outcomes.

Signed cases. Delivered. Ready to litigate.

We fund the marketing. Our MVA-trained team handles intake and signs retainers. You receive cases — not contacts to chase.

~$3,000 per signed case
7 cases in 30 days — or we work free until delivered
87% of partners renew

For attorneys signing 10+ MVA cases/month.

No retainers. No setup fees.

Upgrade your model.

📌 **PROMPT:** Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "IT'S NOT A LEAD PROBLEM. IT'S A MODEL PROBLEM." in bold white. CENTER: Two models compared. LEFT (faded/gray): "2015 MODEL" — "Buy leads → Hope → Chase → Maybe sign". RIGHT (highlighted #3399FF): "2026 MODEL" — "Buy outcomes → Receive signed cases → Litigate". Arrow pointing to 2026 model. BOTTOM: "Upgrade your model." in white. Sharp corners. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, soft gradients, emojis.

## AD 5: GUARANTEE HOOK #2 ⭐
**Opener:** Question format

What would 7 signed MVA cases do for your firm this month?

We'll deliver them in 30 days. Or we work free until we do.

No leads to chase. No intake to manage. No hoping your team converts.

Just signed retainers, delivered to your desk.

Our MVA-trained intake team handles everything — from first contact to signed agreement. You focus on what you do best: winning cases.

~$3,000 average per signed case
8 figures generated for client firms
87% partner retention after 90 days

For PI attorneys signing 10+ cases/month.

📌 **PROMPT:** Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "WHAT WOULD 7 SIGNED CASES DO FOR YOU?" in white with question mark icon. CENTER: Stack of 7 case file icons with checkmarks, arranged in grid. Label: "DELIVERED IN 30 DAYS". Blue glow effect. Below: "Or we work free." BOTTOM: Stats row "8 FIGURES GENERATED | 87% RETENTION | $3K AVG/CASE" in #3399FF. Sharp corners. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, soft gradients, emojis.

---

## AD 6: TIME ANGLE
**Opener:** Pain point — time

Every hour your intake team spends chasing bad leads is an hour you're paying for nothing.

Every consultation with someone who "already has a lawyer" is time you'll never get back.

Every follow-up sequence on a dead lead is opportunity cost bleeding out.

What if you got that time back?

We handle the entire front end:
→ We fund the marketing
→ We generate demand
→ We qualify
→ We sign the retainer

You receive signed cases. Period.

~$3,000 per signed case
87% partner retention

For firms signing 10+ cases/month.

📌 **PROMPT:** Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "YOUR TIME ISN'T FREE" with clock icon draining. CENTER: Two paths. LEFT (red tint): Tasks stacking — "Chase leads" "Bad consultations" "Dead follow-ups" — clock running out. RIGHT (blue): Clean path — "Signed cases delivered" — clock full. BOTTOM: "Get your time back." with "$3K/case" in #3399FF. Sharp corners. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, soft gradients, emojis.

## AD 7: EMOJI ATTENTION GRABBER 🔥
**Opener:** Heavy emoji + urgency

⚖️ PI ATTORNEYS ⚖️

Here's what that looks like:

📌 **PROMPT:** Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "⚖️ STILL BUYING LEADS IN 2026? ⚖️" in bold white. CENTER: Two columns with emoji-style icons. LEFT (red Xs): List of failures — "100 leads" "85 don't qualify" etc. RIGHT (blue checkmarks): List of wins — "We fund" "We qualify" "We sign". Large contrast. BOTTOM: "87% renew 📈" with "$3K/case" in #3399FF. Sharp corners. This one can have emoji icons in the image. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, soft gradients.

## AD 8: INTAKE DEFENSE
**Opener:** Defends the intake team

Your intake team isn't the problem.

When 85% of "leads" are garbage from the start — wrong injury, no treatment, already represented — no training fixes that.

They're not dropping balls. They were handed garbage.

Here's the fix: Stop handing them garbage.

We pre-qualify every prospect before you see them:
✓ Verified MVA injury
✓ Treatment confirmed
✓ Not currently represented
✓ Clear liability indicators

Your team stops sorting trash and starts working real cases.

~$3,000 per signed case
87% partner retention

📌 **PROMPT:** Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "YOUR INTAKE TEAM ISN'T THE PROBLEM" in bold white. CENTER: Intake worker buried under papers labeled "JUNK LEADS" — then arrow to same worker with clean desk and single "SIGNED CASE" document. Before/after style. BOTTOM: "Stop handing them garbage." Blue checkmarks for qualification criteria. Sharp corners. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos of real people, soft gradients, emojis.
