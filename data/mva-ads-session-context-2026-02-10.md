*For pickup on Feb 11*

---

## 📊 SESSION SUMMARY

**Duration:** ~3 hours (19:30-22:30 UTC)
**Focus:** MVA lead gen Meta ad campaign overhaul

---

## 🎯 WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED

### 1. Ad Copy Written (15 total)

**Full-Copy Ads (12):**
| # | Name | Angle |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | Quality Volume | Lead quality vs volume problem |
| 2 | Intake Defense | Your team isn't failing - garbage leads |
| 3 | Speed Myth | Speed-to-lead won't fix bad leads |
| 4 | Vendor Secret | "Exclusive" leads aren't exclusive |
| 5 | ROI Simple | $2,000 per signed case, simple math |
| 6 | Top Firms Quiet | Best firms don't share sources |
| 7 | Rage Bait | Vendor math exposé - "You're the product" |
| 8 | FOMO | Competitors already know about this |
| 9 | Time Angle | Your time is worth more than sorting leads |
| 10 | Comparison | TV ads $50K, Billboards $30K, Us $2K |
| 11 | Burnout | Your team is exhausted. Here's why. |

**Nothing-Style Ads (3):**
- Headline + URL only (no body copy)
- Tested well in current campaign ($78 CPA)

### 2. Image Creatives Generated

**Located in:** `/home/ec2-user/clawd/ads/mva-feb-2026/`

| Version | Status | Issue |
|---------|--------|-------|
| V1 (5 images) | ❌ Bad | Generic logos, cut off text |
| V2 (5 images) | ⚠️ Better | Still not matching reference style |
| V3 (5 images) | ✅ Good | Matches Ad #17b style with infographics |

**Reference creatives saved:**
- `reference-ad17b.png` — Winning ad style (industrial tech, funnel diagrams)
- `reference-nothing-ad.png` — Nothing ad style (LP screenshot)

### 3. Funnel Diagnosis Completed

**Score: 5/10**

**Critical Issues Found:**
- "One Firm Per Market" missing from LP (but Marko said don't change LP)
- Zero social proof on LP
- "Apply" CTA implies rejection
- Voice mismatch: Ads emotional → LP cold/technical

**Resolution:**
- Keep LP unchanged
- Ads should match LP messaging ("exclusive leads, never shared")
- NOT "one firm per market" (not actually how it works)

### 4. Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Context |
|----------|---------|
| **Signed cases ONLY** | No warm transfer offer in ads |
| **Pricing: ~$2K average** | Only pricing reference in ads |
| **Exclusivity = per-lead** | Each lead 100% exclusive (not per-market) |
| **Remove conversion rates** | Not relevant when delivering signed cases |
| **Add PI qualifier to all ads** | "PI ATTORNEYS:" at start to filter non-lawyers |

---

## 📁 FILES CREATED

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/home/ec2-user/clawd/ads/mva-feb-2026/*.png` | 19 ad creatives (V1-V3 + references) |
| `/home/ec2-user/clawd/data/mva-campaign-plan-feb-2026.md` | Campaign plan doc |
| Notion: MVA Campaign Ads Feb 2026 | Ad copy + prompts (but prompts missing initially) |

**Status:**
- All 15 ad concepts written ✅

## 🔧 TOOLS USED

| Tool | How |
|------|-----|

| **Meta Ads API** | Pulled current campaign creatives for reference |
| **Notion** | Saved ad copy (but forgot prompts initially - fixed in V2/V3) |

---

## 🏔️ SELF-EVALUATION

### What I Did Well ✅
1. **Recovered quickly** when prompts weren't matching reference style — pulled actual winning ad images and adapted
2. **Ran comprehensive funnel diagnosis** — caught LP/ad mismatch issues
3. **Listened to corrections** — removed conversion rates, fixed exclusivity messaging
4. **Generated multiple image versions** until quality matched expectations
5. **Organized work systematically** — ads folder, numbered versions, reference images saved

### What I Did Poorly ❌
1. **Forgot I had LP source** — Marko had to remind me I built the landing page (embarrassing 🫣)
2. **Initially made shit ad images** — First prompts were too simple, didn't match reference style
3. **Didn't save prompts with ads initially** — Had to regenerate because I didn't document properly
4. **Got confused on ad counts** — Kept miscounting (said 8 new angles when I only mentioned 3)
5. **Too many tool calls narrated** — Could have been more concise in execution

### Grade: 7/10
Solid session but with unnecessary friction. The output is good, but I made Marko correct me multiple times on things I should have remembered or done right the first time.

## 📋 NEXT SESSION CHECKLIST

1. **Review the 15 ads** in Notion for final approval
2. **Generate remaining creatives** for Time/Comparison/Burnout angles
3. **Discuss deployment strategy** — which ads to launch first
4. **Meta campaign setup** — upload to Ads Manager
5. **Consider LP improvements** (if Marko changes mind):
   - Add social proof
   - "We fund the marketing" callout
   - "What happens next" section

---

## 🔑 KEY CONTEXT TO REMEMBER

- **LP lives at:** kuriosbrand.com (Cloudflare Pages)
- **LP source at:** `/home/ec2-user/clawd/projects/kuriosbrand/`
- **Winning current ads:** #17b (industrial tech style), Nothing ad (LP screenshot)
- **Pricing:** ~$2,000 average cost per signed case
- **Model:** We fund ads → PI-trained intake qualifies → We close retainer → Client receives signed case
- **No monthly retainer, no setup fees, we fund ad spend**
- **Exclusivity = per lead (never shared), NOT per market**
