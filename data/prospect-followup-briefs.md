## 1. Rich Hyde (TX) - trialtribe.com

### Contact Info
- **Name:** Rich Hyde
- **Email:** rich@trialtribe.com
- **Phone:** +1 (817) 301-5572
- **Website:** trialtribe.com
- **State:** Texas
- **Contact ID:** juzgRShK6CE84VH8jJMj

### Call Summary (Jan 13, 2026)
Rich is a **trial lawyer** in Texas with significant experience. He's been burned by multiple lead vendors (Walker, Quintessa, etc.) and is extremely cautious about new partnerships. Key concerns:
- **Currently pays ~$2,500/signed MVA case** from other vendors
- **Hates the "media buy" model** - prefers pay-per-qualified-lead with contractual guarantees
- **Strict qualification criteria:** Treatment within 30 days, no gaps >30 days, clear liability, verified insurance
- Wants **replacement credits** if leads don't meet criteria
- Mentioned **Angel Reyes** as a comparison (don't mention his name - they have history)
- Interested in **MVA and trucking cases only**
- Wants things **in writing** with guarantees

Rich pushed back hard on the standard media buy model but was open to:
- Fixed maximum case costs
- Guaranteed minimum cases
- Contractual terms for credits on unqualified leads

### Email Thread Summary
- **Jan 15:** Mark sent intro email to connect Rich with Patrick for call
- **Jan 16 (1:15 AM):** Rich responded late saying he just saw the email
- **Jan 16 (2:19 AM):** Mark confirmed Patrick availability for morning call
- **Last Contact:** January 16, 2026

### Current Status
**Needs to talk to Patrick** - First call was positive, Patrick intro email sent

### Recommended Next Action
Follow up to schedule Patrick call. Rich is a **sophisticated buyer** who wants contractual protections. Frame the pitch around:
1. Guaranteed case cost caps (e.g., "max $3,000/case or we credit you")
2. Written criteria agreement upfront
3. Patrick's ability to vet to HIS standards (not generic criteria)
4. Emphasize the 30-day treatment window we already enforce

**Priority: HIGH** - Large potential buyer if we can meet his terms
