## KEY PATTERNS ACROSS ALL ADS

### What's Working:
1. **Video ads dominate** — Almost all top performers use video
2. **Lead magnets** — Free guides convert browsers to leads
3. **Scarcity/Territory exclusivity** — "Your area might still be open"
4. **Anti-agency messaging** — "Most agencies are all talk"
5. **Risk reversal** — Performance-based pricing, guarantees
6. **Trust stacks** — Checkmarks, reviews, years in business
7. **Identity framing** — "You're a lawyer, not a marketer"
8. **Specific results** — "$2M revenue", "500K subscribers"

### What's NOT common:
- Website-only offers (all bundle services)
- Pricing on ads (everyone hides pricing)
- AI/GEO optimization (nobody talking about it yet)

### Angles NOT being used (opportunities):
- "Burned by agencies" direct callout
- Ownership guarantee (anti-Scorpion positioning)
- AI-ready websites
- Speed guarantee (14-day delivery)
- One-time pricing transparency
