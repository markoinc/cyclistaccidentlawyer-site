- ❌ Your competitors rank above you for searches YOUR customers are making
- ❌ You're stuck paying monthly "SEO fees" with nothing to show for it

## FAQ

**Q: How is this so cheap? Other agencies quoted me $15,000+**
A: We use AI to handle the heavy lifting — research, initial copywriting, code generation. This lets us deliver agency-quality work at a fraction of the cost. You're not paying for a fancy office in Manhattan.

**Q: Do I need to pay monthly after?**
A: Nope. $5,000 is the full price. You'll need your own hosting ($10-30/month) and domain ($15/year), but that's it. No mandatory "maintenance fees."

**Q: What if I already have a website?**
A: We can rebuild it with proper SEO architecture, or migrate your content to a new optimized site. Same price.

**Q: What about ongoing SEO?**
A: This package gives you a strong SEO foundation. If you want ongoing content, link building, and monthly optimization, we offer that separately. But many businesses see solid results just from the foundation.

**Q: What industries do you work with?**
A: Anyone who needs local or service-based search visibility — contractors, lawyers, dentists, agencies, coaches, consultants. If people Google for what you do, we can help.

**Q: Can I see examples?**
A: [Link to portfolio / case studies]
