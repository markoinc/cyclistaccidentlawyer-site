Question | Answer
---------|--------
What do you offer? | Two options: exclusive MVA leads delivered to your team, or live transfers where we qualify and warm transfer claimants directly to your intake. Depends on what fits your setup.
What's the difference between leads and transfers? | Leads = we deliver the contact, you call them. Live transfers = we do all follow-up and warm transfer qualified claimants to you while on the line. Higher touch, higher sign rate.
What's the catch? | No catch — we make money when you sign cases. Our incentives are aligned. We do pilot batches so you can see results before committing.
How much does it cost? | Depends on whether you want leads or live transfers, and your state/volume. The team can walk you through exact numbers on a quick call — want me to find a time?
Are the leads exclusive? | 100% exclusive. Every lead we generate only goes to one firm. Never shared.
What's the minimum? | We have a minimum to make sure we can deliver meaningful results. The team can explain the options on a call.
How do I know the leads are real? | Every lead is OTP-verified (they confirm via text code) and goes through TrustedForm/Jornaya compliance. Real people, real contact info.
What states do you work in? | We're in 30+ states including Texas, California, Florida, Arizona, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and more. What state are you in?
I've been burned by lead vendors before | Totally understand — that's why we do pilot batches. Prove ROI first, then scale. No long contracts, cancel anytime.
What's the conversion rate? | For live transfers: 40-60% sign rates because they're pre-qualified and warm transferred. For leads: depends on your intake team, but our leads are high quality.
How fast do you contact leads? | For live transfers: within 5 minutes, then 18 touches over 9 days. For leads: delivered in real-time, your team follows up.
Do you sign the cases? | We can do either — warm transfer to your intake, or full case signing through our partner team. Whatever works for your setup.
What CRMs do you integrate with? | Lead Docket, Filevine, Litify, Salesforce, Clio — or we can work with your existing system.
Which should I choose - leads or transfers? | If you have a strong intake team and want control, leads might be better. If you want done-for-you and higher sign rates, transfers. The team can help you figure it out on a call.
How does it work? | We offer two options: exclusive leads delivered to your team, or live transfers where we do all follow-up and warm transfer qualified claimants to your intake. What sounds more interesting?
