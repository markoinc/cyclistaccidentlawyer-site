Question | Answer
---------|--------
What do you offer? | We deliver fully signed MVA cases to your firm. We fund the marketing, run the campaigns, and our PI-trained intake team closes retainers on your behalf. You don't touch a lead until it's already a signed case.
What's the difference between you and other lead vendors? | Lead vendors give you contacts to chase. We give you signed cases. We handle the entire pipeline — marketing, qualification, follow-up, and retainer signing. You receive cases ready to work.
What's the catch? | No catch — we only make money when you sign cases. Our incentives are 100% aligned with yours. We do pilot batches so you see results before committing to volume.
How much does it cost? | Around $3,000 average per signed case — varies by state, volume, and how long we've been working together. The team can walk you through exact numbers for your market on a quick call.
Are the cases exclusive? | 100% exclusive. Every case we sign only goes to one firm. Never shared, never resold. One campaign, one firm per market.
What's the minimum? | We have minimums to ensure we can deliver meaningful results. Typically firms start with a pilot batch of cases to prove ROI before scaling. The team can explain options on a call.
How do I know the cases are real? | Every case goes through our PI-trained intake team. We verify the accident, confirm injury, establish intent, and close the retainer before you ever see it. You're not paying for leads — you're paying for signed clients.
What states do you work in? | We're actively generating cases in 30+ states including Texas, California, Florida, Arizona, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and more. What state are you in?
I've been burned by lead vendors before | Totally understand — that's exactly why we don't sell leads. We sell signed cases. You don't pay until there's a retainer signed. We do pilot batches to prove ROI first, then scale. No long contracts, cancel anytime.
What's the conversion rate? | From our warm transfers to signed cases: 40-60%. But you don't have to worry about that — we handle the conversion. You just receive signed cases.
How does the intake process work? | Our MVA-trained intake team contacts prospects within 5 minutes, follows up 18+ times over 9 days, qualifies them thoroughly, and closes retainers on your behalf. You only see the case after it's signed.
Do you sign the cases? | Yes — that's our core offer. Our intake team closes retainers on your behalf. You receive fully signed MVA cases ready to work.
What CRMs do you integrate with? | Lead Docket, Filevine, Litify, Salesforce, Clio — or we can work with your existing system. Signed cases drop right into your workflow.
How long does it take to get started? | Most firms see their first signed cases within 2-3 weeks of kickoff. We need a few days to set up your campaign and start generating demand, then our intake team works the pipeline.
Why should I trust you with my market? | We only work with ONE firm per market — ever. Your competitors literally cannot hire us. Our reputation depends on your results, so we're incentivized to deliver.
What if the cases don't convert for my firm? | If a case we signed doesn't meet our quality standards (verified MVA, confirmed injury, intent to pursue), we replace it. We stand behind our work.
What makes you different from other PI marketing companies? | Three things: (1) We sell signed cases, not leads — you pay for results, not activity. (2) We only work with one firm per market — true exclusivity. (3) No retainers, no setup fees, no ad spend required from you — we fund everything.
