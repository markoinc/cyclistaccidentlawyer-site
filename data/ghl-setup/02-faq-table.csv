Question,Answer
"What do you offer?","Two options: exclusive MVA leads delivered to your team, or live transfers where we qualify and warm transfer claimants directly to your intake. Depends on what fits your setup."
"What's the difference between leads and transfers?","Leads = we deliver the contact, you call them. Live transfers = we do all follow-up and warm transfer qualified claimants to you while on the line. Higher touch, higher sign rate."
"How much does it cost?","Depends on whether you want leads or transfers, and your state/volume. The team can walk you through exact numbers on a call — want me to find a time?"
"What's the pricing?","Pricing varies by state and volume. Team can break down the exact math for your market on a quick call."
"Are the leads exclusive?","100% exclusive. Every lead only goes to one firm. Never shared. That's a big reason our partners see strong sign rates."
"Do you sell leads to multiple firms?","Never. 100% exclusive — each lead goes to one firm only."
"What states do you work in?","We're in 30+ states including Texas, California, Florida, Arizona, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, New York, and more."
"Do you cover my state?","We're in 30+ states. What state are you in? I can check if we have capacity."
"What's the minimum?","We have a minimum to make sure we can deliver meaningful results. Team can explain the options on a call."
"Is there a minimum commitment?","We have minimums to ensure meaningful results, but no long-term contracts. The team can walk you through options."
"How do I know the leads are real?","Every lead is OTP-verified (they confirm via text code) and goes through TrustedForm/Jornaya compliance. Real people, real contact info."
"Are the leads verified?","Yes — OTP-verified contact info plus TrustedForm and Jornaya compliance on every lead."
"What's the conversion rate?","For live transfers: 40-60% sign rates because they're pre-qualified and warm transferred. For leads: depends on your intake, but quality is high."
"What's the sign rate?","Our live transfers see 40-60% sign rates. They're pre-qualified and warm transferred while still on the line."
"How fast do you contact leads?","For live transfers: within 5 minutes, then 18 touches over 9 days. For leads: delivered in real-time, your team follows up."
"What's the follow-up process?","For transfers: 5 minute speed-to-lead, 18 touches over 9 days, calls and texts. We handle all of it. You just answer warm transfers."
"Do you sign the cases?","We can, yeah — if your team is stretched thin or you just want signed retainers delivered, we have that option. But most firms prefer transfers or leads. Team can discuss what fits on a call."
"Can you handle the intake?","We can if needed — some firms prefer us to handle everything and just deliver signed cases. But most do their own intake with our leads or transfers. Depends on your setup."
"What CRMs do you integrate with?","Lead Docket, Filevine, Litify, Salesforce, Clio — or we can work with your existing system."
"Do you work with my CRM?","We integrate with most major legal CRMs — Lead Docket, Filevine, Litify, Salesforce, Clio. Or we can adapt to your system."
"Which should I choose - leads or transfers?","If you have a strong intake team and want control, leads might be better. If you want done-for-you and higher sign rates, transfers. Team can help you figure it out on a call."
"I'm not sure which option is right for me","No problem — that's what the call is for. Team can learn about your setup and recommend the right fit."
"I've been burned by lead vendors before","Totally understand — that's why we do pilot batches. Prove ROI first, then scale. No long contracts, cancel anytime."
"Every vendor says the same thing","I get it — you've heard it all before. That's why we start with pilots. Small test, prove the numbers, then decide. No big commitment upfront."
"The only people making money are the marketers","Heard that before. Our model is different — we only win when you sign cases. That's why we do pilots first. Prove ROI, then scale."
"I've spent six figures and got nothing","That's brutal, and unfortunately common in this space. Our pilot approach exists specifically for attorneys like you — test small, see real numbers, then decide."
"I could care less about leads, I want cases","Exactly the right mindset. That's why we focus on sign rate, not lead volume. Our transfers convert at 40-60% because they're pre-qualified."
"How do I know you're different?","Fair question. Two things: 1) We start with pilots so you see real results before committing. 2) Our established partners have been with us 4+ years. Happy to connect you with references."
"What's the catch?","No catch — we make money when you sign cases. Our incentives are aligned. We do pilots so you can see results before committing."
"I have all the risk here","We designed the pilot model specifically to share the risk. You test small, see real numbers, then decide. No long contracts, cancel anytime."
"What makes you different from other vendors?","Three things: 100% exclusive leads (never shared), pilot-based approach (prove ROI first), and our follow-up system (18 touches, 5 min speed-to-lead). Many clients 4+ years."
"Why should I trust you?","Don't trust us — test us. That's why we do pilots. Small commitment, prove the numbers work for your market, then scale if it makes sense."
"I'm skeptical","Good — you should be. That's exactly why we do pilots. See real results with real numbers before making any bigger commitment."
"Show me proof","Happy to share case studies and connect you with references. But ultimately, the pilot is your proof — real results in your market."
"Do you have case studies?","Yes — happy to share some examples. But the real proof is the pilot. You'll see actual numbers for your state and practice."
"Can I talk to current clients?","Absolutely. We can connect you with references who've been with us long-term. Just ask the team on the call."
"How does live transfer work?","We run ads, call within 5 minutes, do 18 follow-up touches over 9 days. When they're qualified (clear liability, treatment within 21 days, no rep), we warm transfer them live to your intake."
"What's the qualification criteria?","For transfers: clear liability, receiving treatment within 21 days, no existing representation. Plus OTP-verified contact info."
"How are leads qualified?","Clear liability, treatment within 21 days, no existing attorney. Contact info is OTP-verified (they confirm via text code)."
"What if quality drops after the first month?","Same filters, always. We don't bait and switch. Our established partners have been with us 4+ years for a reason."
"Do you bait and switch?","Never. Same qualification criteria, always. That's why we have partners who've been with us over 4 years."
"Can I start with a small test?","That's exactly how we prefer to start. Prove the numbers work, then scale. The team can set up a pilot on the call."
"What's the pilot look like?","Usually 30 transfers in 30 days, or a set number of leads depending on your preference. Enough volume to see real results. Team can customize on the call."
"How long is the contract?","No long-term contracts. Pilot first, then month-to-month. Cancel anytime."
"Is there a contract?","No long-term commitment. We do pilots first, then month-to-month. You can cancel anytime."
"Can I cancel anytime?","Yes — no long-term contracts. We keep clients by delivering results, not locking them in."
"What if it doesn't work?","That's what the pilot is for. You'll know pretty quickly if the numbers work for your market. If not, no hard feelings — no long contract."
"What's the cost per case?","Most states run $2,000–$2,500 per signed case. California's higher — around $3,000–$3,500. Established partners with volume see even better numbers over time. Team can run the exact math for your state."
"What's my ROI going to be?","Most states see $2,000–$2,500 per signed case. California runs $3–3.5K. Established partners do even better. Team can run your specific numbers on a call."
"I do my own intake","Perfect — leads might be the better fit. You control the follow-up and work them your way. Or transfers if you want done-for-you."
"My intake team is small","Live transfers might be ideal then — we do all the heavy lifting. Your team just answers warm, qualified calls."
"I don't have an intake team","No problem. We can handle full intake through our partner, or warm transfer directly to you or your staff."
"How many leads/transfers can you do?","Depends on your state and capacity. We scale with demand. Team can discuss volume on the call."
"Can you scale up?","Absolutely. Most clients start with a pilot, prove ROI, then scale. We can grow with you."
"What's your capacity in my state?","Depends on the state — some markets are more competitive. Tell me your state and I'll check what's available."
"How does billing work?","Varies by product and arrangement. Team can walk you through the specifics on a call."

"Do you do other case types?","We specialize in MVA cases. That's where we've built our expertise and volume."
"How do the ads work?","We run Meta, Google, and YouTube ads targeting people who've been in accidents. Our team handles all the creative and targeting."
"Where do leads come from?","Meta ads, Google ads, YouTube — we target people who've been in car accidents and are looking for legal help."
"What information do I get with each lead?","Full contact info (OTP-verified), accident details, injury info, liability situation, treatment status. Everything your intake needs."
"What happens if a lead is bad?","If it doesn't meet qualification criteria, we work with you to address it. Quality is tracked — we don't want bad leads any more than you do."
"Do you replace bad leads?","We track quality closely and work with partners on any issues. The team can explain our quality guarantee on the call."
"How do I track results?","We provide reporting and can integrate with your CRM. Full transparency on what you're getting."
"Is there a dashboard?","Yes — you'll have visibility into your leads/transfers and results. Team can show you on the call."
"How do I get started?","Book a quick call with the team. They'll learn about your market, answer your questions, and set up a pilot if it's a fit."
"What's the next step?","Quick 15-minute call with the team. They'll break down the numbers for your state and answer any questions. Want me to find a time?"
"I want to think about it","Totally get it. Want me to have the team send over some info you can review? Or I can find a time for a quick call when you're ready."
"Send me more information","Happy to. What's the best email? I'll have the team send over an overview with numbers for your state."
"I'm not ready to commit","No commitment needed — that's what the pilot is for. Just a quick call to see if the numbers make sense for your market."
"Call me later","Sure — when's a good time? I can have the team reach out."
"I'm busy right now","No problem. When's better to chat? Or I can have the team send info to review on your own time."
"Who are you exactly?","Kurios — we help PI firms grow with exclusive MVA leads and live transfers. Been doing this for years with long-term partners across 30+ states."
"How long have you been doing this?","Several years — many of our partners have been with us 4+ years. We've built this specifically for PI firms."
"Are you a law firm?","No — we're a lead generation company that works exclusively with PI firms. We handle the marketing, you handle the cases."
"Do you work with other practice areas?","We specialize in MVA/PI cases. That's where we've built our volume and expertise."
"What's the cost per case in California?","California's a competitive market — expect around $3,000–$3,500 per signed case. Still solid ROI on PI cases, but higher than most states."
"Is California more expensive?","Yeah, California's one of the pricier markets — around $3–3.5K per signed case vs $2–2.5K in most other states. Still works with PI case values."

"Does cost go down over time?","Yes — established and multistate clients see lower cost per case as we optimize and scale. New partners start in the $2–2.5K range for most states."

"What's the price per lead?","We don't really think in terms of price per lead — we focus on cost per signed case since that's the real ROI metric. Most states are $2–2.5K per case."
"How much do you charge per transfer?","We focus on the end result — cost per signed case. That's typically $2,000–$2,500 in most states, higher in California. Team can run your specific numbers."
