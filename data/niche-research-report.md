## 🏆 THE RECOMMENDATION

### Go Med Spas. Here's why it's perfect for YOU specifically:

1. **Your AI automation angle is KILLER here** — Med spa owners are terrified of AI disrupting their client pipeline. "Optimized for ChatGPT" is a PANIC BUTTON for them.

2. **$500/mo is a no-brainer** — They already pay $2K-$5K/mo for basic marketing. You're the cheap option.

3. **$5K-$10K build is reasonable** — Many agencies charge $10K-$25K for med spa sites. You're competitive.

4. **90% template-able** — Same structure for every med spa. Swap name, photos, services. Done in hours with your AI tools.

5. **GBP API = secret weapon** — You can automate their Google Business Profile optimization, which is critical for "med spa near me" searches.

6. **Growing market** — 10K+ and growing 15-20% annually. New med spas opening every day.

7. **Owners are reachable** — Active on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn. Perfect for Meta ads targeting.

8. **Cross-sell potential** — After the website, upsell GBP management, review automation, social content, booking optimization.

### Meta Ad Angle:
**"Is Your Med Spa Invisible to ChatGPT? 73% of patients now start their search with AI. We build websites that AI recommends."**

### Offer Stack:
- **$7,500 Website Build** (AI-optimized, SEO-optimized, mobile-first)
- **$500/mo Management** (SEO maintenance, GBP optimization, AI citation building, monthly reports)
- **Upsell:** $1,500/mo for full GEO + reputation management package

## 🔄 RUNNER-UP PLAY: HVAC as Volume Play

If med spas feel too niche, HVAC gives you:
- 10x the addressable market (100K+ companies)
- Even simpler websites
- But more agency competition and less AI pitch appeal

You could run BOTH niches in parallel — med spas as premium ($10K builds) and HVAC as volume ($5K builds).
