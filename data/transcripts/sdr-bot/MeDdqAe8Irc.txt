# Category: n8n-automation

What is up guys? Welcome back to another
video. In this video, I'm going to show
you how to create a lead scoring AI
agent by creating a simple workflow in
any 10. Let's get started.
In any 10, I've created a workflow that
I've renamed to AI lead scoring agent.
And here we're going to add a trigger.
So here, our trigger is going to be an
onform submission trigger. Over here,
the title of our form could be on the
lines of business growth assessment
form. The description could be on the
lines of fill out this quick form to
help us understand your business
challenges and goals. So here I've
outlined different form elements. We're
going to ask our prospects in order to
qualify them and score them whether they
are a hot lead, warm lead or a cold
lead. Over here the first form element
that are valid over here we are
collecting their name. So here the field
name is on the lines of what's your full
name and type is text. We're going to
fill out their full name. Now for the
the other field then we asking for the
email address where it's in the lines of
what's your work email address. The
element type will be email and you can
add the placeholder over here. So both
of these field will be required fields
here. Field name is on the lines of
what's your company name. Here we're
collecting the company name. Element
type will be text. Can also have this
field also to be required. The other
field name is on the lines of what
industry do your company operate in.
Element type will be text. Can also make
this field as required. The other field
name is on the line of approximately how
many employees does your company have.
The element type here will be number
since we're collecting a numerical
value. And then here this field will
also be required. The other field name
we're collecting their challenges or
goals that motivated them to fill out
this form. Element type we're choosing
text. This field name will also be
required. The other field name is on the
line server. Which area are you most
interested in improving? Yeah, the
element type choosing a drop-own list
and adding these options over here. So
we're adding the sales process,
marketing, automation, lead generation
and other as the options of this field.
The other field name with the lines of
do you have a budget set aside for this
project? Yeah, we're choosing the
element type is a drop-own list and the
option is yes or no over here. The other
field name is on the lines of how soon
are you looking to take action on this
and then the element type we're choosing
a drop-own list and then the different
options over here. So the first option
is immediately the other option is 1 to
3 months. The other option is 3 to 6
months or and the last one is just
exploring here.
field name is on the lines of how did
you hear about us here we're adding
various options like referral search
could be a Google search
LinkedIn event or and the last option is
the other over here so here I'll execute
step to fill out our form so we can
collect a prospect's data so we can now
proceed to qualify them and give them a
score to do that I'll click on execute
step right here now here's our form can
see the title and the description of our
form Here we're going to add our full
name and our work email address right
here. So
we're also going to add our company
name.
The industry that we're in. How many
employees? We can say 12. What
challenges? You can say lead generation.
What areas are you mostly interested in
improving? Can say lead generation over
here. Do you already have a budget? Can
say yes. How soon are you looking to
start? Can say immediately. How did you
hear about us? You can see Google search
and here click on submit. You can see
that our form was submitted
successfully. We can see that we
captured our data that we filled in our
form over here. So we captured the full
name, working email address, company
name, the industry that we're in, number
of employees, challenges that we're
facing, areas we're interested in
improving, if you have a budget, how
soon we're looking to start, how we
heard about the company or the agency
and the date and time submitted the
form. So here I'll click on back to
canvas and then we can pin this data and
use this data that we just submitted
right here to set up our workflow. So
the next thing that we're going to do
here is we can wait a few seconds. For
example, we can wait let's say 3 seconds
right here. Come back to canvas and can
rename this not to wait 3 seconds.
Then click on rename right here.
And now we can proceed to add our laser
data that we collected via our formula
here to a database. The database we can
use any CRM tool or a database tool. So
we can use either Monday, ClickUp, Air
Table or Google Sheets. Choose to use
Google Sheets as our primary database.
In Google Sheets, I've created a
spreadsheet that I've released data
spreadsheet. This is a spreadsheet that
we're going to add our prospects
information after they've submitted the
information via our form. So here in
this spreadsheet, I've created three
sheets. One for the leads, the other one
for the hot leads, warm leads, and the
cold leads. Right here, we add in the
prospect that we collect that fill out
our form. And then after we've qualified
them and given the MS score, we're going
to add them to these three sheets over
here. According to where they rank this
sheet, we're going to add their full
name, email, company name, industry,
number of employees, challenges they're
facing, if they have a budget, when they
would like to start, and how they us
over here. So to add these prospects
information to this spreadsheet in our
workflow, I'm going to search for Google
Sheets. Then here I'm going to click on
Google Sheets. Then I'll click on append
drawing sheet. Yeah, we'll first of all
need to execute this node over here. So
we can have access to the information
that is submitted right here. And then
I'll open this node right here. And now
you can see now we have the data over
here. So now we can proceed to add the
data spreadsheet. But first here you
need to create a credential by clicking
on create a new credential right here.
Then here sign in with your Google
account. The new window that pops up
choose the account that you like to
connect to anytime. And then your
connection will be created. Since I had
already done that, I'm going to close
this right here. And then here I'm going
to find our document. Our document is
this document right here called le data
spreadsheet. And then here we're going
to find our sheet which is this list
sheet right here. And then we're going
to map columns in our spreadsheet with
the data that the prospect fill in our
form. So for the full name, we're going
to map it right here.
Going to map the email address column.
industry number of employees
challenges they facing if they have a
budget when they would like to sort
and how they heard about us over here.
Now to add these prospects information
to our spreadsheet I'll click on execute
set right here can see our node has been
executed and it was executed
successfully. Now when I open our
spreadsheet you can see we added our
prospects information right here. We
added their full name, email, company
name, industry, number of employees,
challenges, if they have a budget, when
they like to start, and how they heard
about us. Right here in our spreadsheet,
we're going to rename this now to list
data
here. And then I'll click on account
rename. The next thing we're going to do
here is after we've captured their data
and added them to our database, we're
going to now qualify them and give these
leads a score. To do that, we're going
to use an AI agent. So in AI, I'm going
to click on AI agent right here. Yeah,
I'm going to choose to define below and
add a prompt over here for the agent.
The prompt could be in the lines of
you're an expert B2B lead scoring
analyst. Your job is to analyze a lead
record and output only a valid JSON with
the score and recommendations. Be strict
and concise. Never return text outside
of the JSON. I'll click on add option to
add a system message here. And then I'll
click on expression and expand here to
add a system message. Here the system
message could be on the lines of you'll
receive a lead record below. So here we
are outlining their name, email, company
name, industry, number of employees,
challenges they're facing, if they have
a budget, when they would like to start
and how they heard about about us. Yep.
Your task using the think tool is to
classify the lead into four categories
based on fit, intent, engagement and
overall potential. Instead of whole
categories, we have only three
categories. And then here we categories.
The first category is a hot lead which
is a perfect fit, high intent and strong
engagement should be contacted
immediately by sales. The other category
is warm lead which is a good fit with
some intent of engagement worth pursuing
but not urgent. The last category is a
cold lead where it's not a good fit, no
budget, wrong role or industry or
otherwise unsuitable. Only output a
single JSON object. Use the lead details
provided below to make the
classification. Then here I'll click on
back to canvas. Here we're going to add
a chat model. For the chat model we're
going to use open AI chat model right
here. Here like we did with the Google
sheet. You also need to create a
credential to connect your OpenAI 2010
by clicking on create a new credential
and then here adding your API key right
here from your OpenAI API and then click
on save to create your credential. Since
I had already done that, I'm going to
close this right here and here come and
choose our model. You can choose any of
these models right here including GPD5
which is the latest model that we're
using currently. I'm going to choose GP
4.1 mini quite fast. And then here on
back to canvas can drag this to the top
right here. Then the other thing that
we're going to add is a memory. I'm
going to choose a simple memory right
here. Choose to define it below. Then an
expression I'm going to add
here. I'll add the submitted data here.
Click on back to canvas. Now
the next thing that we're going to add
here is the think tool since we like to
use the thing tool to classify our lids.
Then here I'm going to click on back to
canvas right here.
Last
thing that we're going to add here is a
JSON output example
and I open this node right here. Yeah, I
require a specific output format. Then
I'll click on output puzzle. And here
I'm going to click on structured output
puzzle. We're going to add a JSON
example right here. And then here I'll
paste our JSON. So here we like to
output the lead ID classification if
it's either a hot lead, a warm lead or a
cold lead. And the reason why we are
classifying them as such here. So here I
click on back to converse. We can also
add our structured output node at the
top right here. Now I'll click on save.
I'll open our AI agent. Then I'll
execute step right here to classify our
lead and give it a score using our AI
agent. Can see one of it was executed
successfully. We classify them as a hot
lead right here. So yeah for the reason
why we classify them as a as a hot lead
is a perfect fit from from automation
service industry with 12 employees has
high intent to start immediately has a
budget and showed strong engagement by
finding us through Google search. The
reason why we classify them as a hot
lead this is awesome. So our agent works
perfectly. Yeah I'll rename the agent to
leading agent
here. And the next thing now we can do
here is we can wait a few seconds. For
example, we can wait let's say it say 4
seconds here
can rename this node to wait 4 seconds
here and then click on rename can
execute the node here
and now here since we're categorizing
our lead into three categories we're
going to use a switch node direct the
leads appropriately So if it's a I'll
search for the switch node here. Click
on it
here. If the classification value is a
hot leader
like for them to go through the hot lead
path or roots and then here I'll add
another root and then the classification
value is the warm leader.
We like for them to go through the warm
lead route.
And then lastly, if the classification
of the lead is equal to
cold leader,
the output we like for the leads to go
through the cold lead path. So here when
I execute this step, you can see we're
classifying our lead as hot lead. Now we
can go ahead and set up our hot leader
rout. So if the lead is a hot lead, the
first thing that we're going to do here
is we can wait a few seconds. For
example, we can wait let's say 2 seconds
to add this little spreadsheet.
So here I rename this to wait to
seconds.
And since these are hot leads, we can
proceed to add them to our hot lead
sheet in our spreadsheet. So in Google
sheet, I'll click on I'll search for
Google Sheets and click on append sheet
here. We can uh run this node so we can
capture the data and come over here to
add the data to our spreadsheet. So now
here I'm going to choose our document.
It's going to be the latest spreadsheet.
And then now here we're going to choose
the hot lead
shape
and here we're going to map values to
columns in our spreadsheet with the data
with our hot list data here. So to get
the data we're going to grab the data
from our form over here. So for the full
name we're going to map it over here.
Email address,
company name,
industry,
number of employees, challenges,
budgets,
when they would like to start and how
they have about us here. So to add the
data to fresh, I'll I'll click on
execute step here
and see our mode was executed
successfully. I open our hot leads
sheet. You can see we added our hot lead
over here to our spreadsheet to to our
sheet using this node over here. So here
I'll rename this node to hot lead data
and then here I'll go rename. Now the
next thing that we can do here since
this is a hot lead we like to notify our
team that we have a hot lead and this
should reach out to them soon. So here
you can you can contact your team
depending on the platform that you're
using as a communication platform with
your team. So you can use Slug, email,
Telegram, WhatsApp or any other tool I
use to communicate with your team. Yeah,
I'm going to choose Gmail as our tool.
So I'll click on I'll search for Gmail
and click on Gmail and then here I'll
click on send a message node right here.
I'll rename this node to team
notification and then I'll open this
node right here.
You also need you'll need to create a
credential like we did with other nodes
over here by clicking on create a new
credential. Then over here click on sign
in with your Google account. Then on the
new window that pops up choose the
account that you like to connect to any.
Then after creating your connection
click on close over here. And then here
you'll add the email address of your
team members over here. And then the
subject line of this email could be the
lines of new hot lead a lot. Immediate
action required. Email type. I'm going
to choose text and then the message
could be the lines of hi team. We've
identified a new hot lead that fits a
wide client profile and is ready to to
move forward quickly. Here's their name
and their company name here. So we add
in the name of the prospect and their
company name. These one should be
contacted within the next 24 hours.
Please prioritize outreach, tailor the
conversation to their stated needs and
guide them towards booking a call or a
demo right away. Let's move forward and
close this opportunity quick automation
team. And here I click on back to
canvas. And then the last thing that
we're going to do here is I'll add an
option and then I'll turn this abandon
notification to off. And then here I'll
click on back to canvas here. Then here
I'll execute this note to notify our
team of this hot lead. You can see our
node was executed successfully. And now
the last thing that we can do here is we
can contact this specific lead by
sending them a very personalized email
telling them that they are qualified to
work with us. This subitted the email
address. So here we're going to message
them via email. So here I'll search for
Gmail again. Then in Gmail I'm going to
click on send a message node over here.
Now in this node I'm going to rename it
to reach out email here. Then I'll open
this note right here.
Here we're going to add the email
address that they submitted in a form
right here. Subject line of the email
could be the lines of let's explore how
we can help you. Email type I'm going to
choose sex. And then the message could
be in the lines of hi name. After
reviewing your information, I can
confidently say that you are the exact
type of partner we work with. We work
best with the challenges and goals.
You've outlined a strong feed for the
solution we provide. And I believe we
can create a real impact together. I'd
love to walk you through how we can
support your growth and answer any
questions you may have. You can pick a
time that works best for you. Right
here, we're going to add our link for
them to schedule for a call. Looking
forward to our conversation. Best
regards, live automation right here.
Like we did with the previous node here,
we also need to turn this
uh any time notification to off. And
here I'll click on back to Converse and
execute this node right here to send the
email to our prospect who filled out our
form telling them that they are a
perfect fit for us.
So the hot lead route is pretty much set
up. Let us try to set up the warm lead
route. To do that, we'll need to fill
out our form as a prospect and using our
AI lead scoring agent right here.
Classify the prospect as the warm lead
over here. So we can set up the rule the
warmly the warm leads root. So to do
that here I'll unan pin this data here
and then I click on execute workflow to
fill out our form again. Here we're
going to fill out our form again with a
with a full name, email address, company
name,
automation, industry, you can say
automation industry,
automation service industry.
How many employees can say one
challenges
can say legion
like interested in improving can say
other you have a budget no soon can say
3 to 6 months as you hear about us can
say an event then here I'll click on
submit our form was submitted
here you can see that our workflow was
executed successfully here
now on our on form submission node right
here we capt have to prospect
information that they filled out in our
form here. Capture the full name, work,
email, company name, industry,
employees, challenges they're facing,
areas they would like to improve, if
they have the budget, when they would
like to start and how they heard about
us over here. And then we waited a few
seconds. Then we added the information
from spreadsheet over here. Then using
our AI agent over here, we classify them
as a warm lead because they're a good
fit in the automation industry. They
have a moderate intent with with 3 to 6
months timeline. However, no current
budget and small company size limit
immediate opportunity was pursuing but
not agent. So here after classifying
them as a warm lead, we waited for a few
seconds then using this node right here.
We added them in the warm leads root
here
in our node right here. So here I'll pin
this data so we can set up our warm
leads root. The first thing that we're
going to do here is we're going to wait
a few seconds. For example, you can wait
let's say 5 seconds. And here I rename
this to wait 5 seconds.
Then here I'll click on rename here. Now
the next thing that we're going to do
here is going to first execute this
node. So we can grab the data here.
Now with the data we can add the lead to
our spreadsheet. So I'll search for
Google sheets and click on append sheet.
Now here we're going to choose our
spreadsheet. Choose this sheet. Choose
this spreadsheet. And our sheet this
time around will be the warm lead sheet.
And now we're going to map values to our
columns in our spreadsheet prospect data
that they filled in our form. So I'll
open our form right here. So we can map
the data here. Full name, the address,
company name, industry,
industry,
number of employees,
challenges they're facing,
budget,
when they would like to start, and
lastly, how they heard about us right
here. And then here, click on execute
step to add this data to our
spreadsheet.
You can see our noodle was executed
successfully. I open our warm leads
sheet. You can see we added our
prospects data here. So we added their
full name, email address, company name,
industry, number of employees,
challenges they're facing, if they if
they have a budget, when they would like
to start and how they heard about us
here in our sheet using the simple
workflow that we created here in any so
here I'll rename this to warmly data
rename like we did with the hotly root.
We can also notify our team and send a
an email to the prospect. So here to do
that I'll search for Gmail.
So here I rename this node to warm leads
team notification. Then click on rename
right here. Then I'll open this node
over here. Here we're going to add the
email address of all team and send them
this email with the subject client which
is in the lines of new warm to email
type. I'm going to choose sex and the
message of the email command the lines
of hi team. We've just identified a
bunch of home leads that show genuine
interest but aren't ready to book a call
yet. These leads see value in what we do
and with the right approach they could
move into the hot territory soon. Here's
a plan game. We'll n them with case
studies, workflows, and success stories.
The goal is to build trust and
engagement, not push immediately for a
call. If they respond positively, we'll
shift them into the hot lead flow and
schedule a meeting. I'll be sharing the
resources and touch point we'll use so
everyone is aligned. Let's focus on
adding value and positioning ourselves
as a trusted partner they can count on.
Thanks for saying sharp on this touch
here can turn into a strong win for us.
Best Brandon and here I'll come back to
Convos and here I'll add an option
notification and turn this to off. And
then I'll click on execute step to send
our team this email here notification of
the warm leads. Now we can also send the
lead an email also. So here I'll search
for Gmail. Click on Gmail. Then here
I'll click on send a message note. And
here I'll rename our node to lightage
email. So here I'll open this node.
We're going to add the email address
that is submitted in our form right here
and then send this email with the
subject line. Let's let's explore how we
can help you. Email type I'm going to
choose text. Then here is the body of
our email. So here we're going to say hi
name.
Thanks again for connecting. I really
like the direction you're taking in the
automation and operations space. Based
on what you shared, I thought you find
this helpful. And here we're going to
add a case study, for example, on how we
helped a real estate agency streamline
their client on boarding and follow up,
cutting manual work by 70% and creating
more predictable results. I've also
pulled together a few workflows examples
that might give you ideas on what's
possible in your role as a team leader.
These are simple, practical setups that
other teams have used to get quick wins.
No pressure at all, but if you'd like, I
can also send over a short demo of one
of the workflows so you can see how it
plays out step by step. Would that be
helpful? best brand. So this could be a
subtle light touch email that we sending
the prospect here who's a warm lead hot
lead. So here like we nodes here I'm
going to turn this to off and then I'll
click on execute step to send this lead
this email. You can see our node was
executed successfully here. So our hot
lead and warm lead roots are pretty much
set up. Let us try to set up the cold
lead route like we did previously here.
We'll also need we're going to unpin
this data and fill out our form again.
with the prospect's data so we can
classify them as a cold lead. I'll click
on execute several here and then here
I'll fill out our form with our full
name work email company name can say
just give it a random input service you
can say I don't know just want to
disqualify this lead employees zero
challenges you can say I don't know
interested in improving can say other
not have a budget just exploring can say
other and here click on submit and see
our form submitted Here
you can see we captured our form
submission. Here is our node. We're
waiting few seconds to add the list of
spreadsheets. Give them a score here and
classify them.
So here you can see that our workflow is
executed successfully. Here we capture
our form submission. Here we capture the
name of the prospect, their email,
company name, industry, employees,
challenges they're facing, areas they
would like to improve, they have a
budget, when they would like to start
and how they heard about us. From here
then we waited a few seconds and added
them to a spreadsheet. And then using
our AI lead score agent, we classify
them as a call lead because the lead has
no budget and an unknown industry, zero
employees and low intent indicating poor
fit and low engagement. So here come
back to comos and then here we waited a
few seconds and you can see over here in
our node we classify them in the call
root. So now let us set up our root
here. The first thing that we're going
to do here is we're going to wait a few
seconds. For example, we can wait let's
say 6 seconds right here or let's say 6
seconds right here and rename this to
wait 6 seconds.
Then here I'll click on rename. Now the
next thing that we're going to do is
we're going to add them to Google Sheets
to Google Sheets. So I'll click on
Google Sheets. Then here I'll click on
append sheet. But first we need to
execute this node right here to get the
data. So we're going to map it to a
spreadsheet.
Then here I'll open this node. And then
here we're going to choose our
spreadsheet. Choose this spreadsheet
right here. And then for the sheet I'm
going to choose the call laser sheet.
Then we're going to map it to the values
of our prospect. So for the full name
we're going to map it right here.
Email address, company name,
industry,
number of employees,
challenges that they're facing,
if they have a budget,
when we would like to start
and how they heard about us here. So
here I click on execute step to add the
list of spreadsheet.
Can see my not executed successfully.
Now when I open or refresh it and click
on the colleagues you can see we added
our lead over here we added their full
name email address company name industry
number of employees challenges they're
facing if they have a budget when they
like to start and how they heard about
us right here using this workflow over
here yeah can rename this node to call
laser data
and then here click on rename like other
roles we also notify our team and notify
the prospects via email let us start by
notifying our team so Here we're going
to notify them via Gmail. So in Gmail,
I'm going to click on send a message
node. Yeah, I rename this node to call
this team notification over here. Then
I'll open this node over here.
Here we're going to add
the team's email address over here and
send them this email with this line
update lead move to email type will be
text and then the message that we're
sending to our team command line. So
here the lead name. So we going to add
the lead name here.
So we're saying team this lead has been
classified as call. This means they are
currently not a feed due to timing,
interest or engagement level. Next step
will move them into our long-term ner
flow so they can continue receiving
occasional value based content. No
direct outreach is needed right now just
like the natural sequence of his job. If
they re-engage down the road, we will
revisit and requify them. This keeps
them warm in the background while we
focus attention on hot and warm leads.
Thanks Brandon. Yeah, I could do the
other the nose here. So we're going to
turn this to off. Then execute save to
send the email to our team right here.
And now we can also notify the leader
email also. So here I'll search for
Gmail. Then I'll click on Gmail. Then
I'll click on send a message not right
here. Now here we're going to add our
lead email address. They submit here in
a form and send them this email with the
subject line the lines of just sharing
something useful with you. Email type is
going to be text and here the message of
the email and the lines of hi name. So
the first name we're going to just add
the name over here. I know timing might
not be right for us to work together
right now and that's totally fine. I
wanted to stay in touch by sharing a
quick resource that other industry
leaders have found valuable. And you can
add a link to a blog post work for
example case study or an industry
insight. No action needed other it might
give you some ideas or inspiration
whenever you're thinking about
streamlining processes. We'll stay
connected and when the timing makes
sense I'll be happy to explore how we
could help. Until then, I'll make sure
to send over the occasional resource
that could be useful to you. Wishing you
a continuous success and then here I can
come back to converse and execute step
before we execute step here. We can turn
this to off here like we did the nodes
and execute steps to send our prospect
email right here. Our node was executed
successfully over here.
So the email that we are sending to the
prospect, I've renamed it to call leads
email in the cold leads root. Now for
the warm leads root, the email that
we're sending to the prospect, I've
renamed it to warm leads email. And for
the the email that we're sending to the
hot lead, I've renamed it to hot leads
right here. Now our workflow is pretty
much set up. Let us test the workflow so
you can see how it works. So here I've
pinned this data over
called lead prospect. So here's the data
that we capture them pre that we
captured previously on the form. Here's
the company name. They don't have they
don't know the industry. They have no
employees. They don't know their
challenges. They don't have a budget.
And they don't even know they would like
to sort. So here we can execute this
workflow to test it.
So here you can see that our workflow
has executed successfully. Here we
capture this lead data over here. Then
we added the lead to wait a few seconds
and add the lead to a spreadsheet over
here. So now when I open the leads sheet
can see we added the leads data over
here. We add the full name, email,
company name, industry, number of
employees challenges they're facing.
They don't know if they have a budget
when they like to start and how they
heard about us over here with this agent
right here. We classify the lead as call
lead right here and the because the
leader has no budget in an unknown
industry
with zero employees and low intent
indicating profit and low engagement and
then here we're waiting a few seconds
and then classifying the leaders call
lead right here and then classifying the
lead in the call lead route here where
we're waiting a few seconds then adding
the lead in a call leads database over
here. So I want to open our call
database right here. You can see we
added the list data right here. We add
the full name, email, company name,
industry, number of employees,
challenges are facing, if they have a
budget, when they like to start and how
they
sending a team notification of this,
notifying the team of this lead.
And we're also sending the lead a call
leader email sharing some valuable
resource that this lead
may benefit from. Here
you can see the email that we are
sending over our team. Over here telling
the team this lead has been classified
as a call lead. That means they're
currently not a fit due to timing,
interest or engagement level. Then we
learning the next step over here. Here
you can see the email that we are
sending to the lead over here. We're
telling them I know the timing may not
be right for us to work together right
now. So fine. I wanted to share with you
a quick resources that you may find
valable. Then you'll be adding a link to
a blog post workflow example case study
or some or an industry insight. So this
email that we're sending to the lead
over here.
So that is uh the call lead route. Let
us try testing the warm lead route. Test
the warm lead route here. We need to
fill out our form again. So I'll print
this. And then here I'll execute our
workflow again. And then here we're
going to fill out our form with with our
with the prospects data. So we're going
to add our full name work email company
name locks
per company name
going to add the industry employee can
say one
challenge that we're facing can say
generation
areas you're most interested can say
lead generation we don't have a budget
how soon are we looking to take action
on this can say 36 months in here can
say length and here submit form. You can
see our form was submitted here.
here. You can see that our workloads
executed successfully. Again, there's no
order. We capture the lead information
that they fill out in our form. So here
we capture their full name, work email
address, company name, industry they are
in, the number of employees they have in
their agency, challenges they're facing,
what they interested in improving, if
they have a budget, when they would like
to start and how they heard about us
right here. Then we're waiting a few
seconds and adding the lead to
spreadsheet over here. So now I click on
lead. You can see we added a new record
right here with the prospects full name,
email address, company names, industry,
number of employees, challenges they're
facing, if they have a budget, when they
would like to start and how they heard
about us. And then after adding them to
our database, we are classifying them
and giving them a score
using this note right here. We are
classifying them as a warm lead because
the industry is good but company size is
very small. There's some intent due to
lead generation challenge but no budget
currently engagement from LinkedIn
presence is moderate with a start
timeline of 3 to 6 months. Overall a
good fit with some intent and engagement
but not judgment of high potential here.
So here we're classifying them as a warm
lead. Now waiting a few seconds and here
we are rooting the lead to the warm
laser root over root over here. We're
waiting a few seconds and adding the
lead to the warm laser database. So now
when I click on the warm lead right here
you can see we added a new record here
with their full name, email address,
company name, industry, number of
employees, challenges they're facing, if
they have a budget, when they like to
start and how they and how they heard
about us.
Then we are proceeding to send our team
a notification and sending the prospect
a warm lead email. You can see the team
notification emails that we're sending
over a team here. We're telling them,
hey team, we just identified a bunch of
new warm leads. They show genuine
interest but are not ready to book a
call yet here. And then here we landing
some next steps. Then here we're telling
the team, I'll be sharing resources and
touch point we'll use. So everyone is
aligned. Let's focus on adding value and
positioning ourselves as a true trusted
partner they can count on.
Okay. So this is the email that we're
sending to our team. And this is the
email that we're sending to the prospect
right here. So with this subject line
and this email body right here where
we're telling we're sending them hi name
thanks again for connecting I really
like the direction you're taking in the
automation and operation space based on
what you shared I thought you'll find
this helpful and then we're sharing a
quick case study over here and you can
also share some examples over here with
a lead the point of these emails is not
to push for a call but just to provide
more value down the road if they're
interested
in converting they can be upgraded into
the hot leads category. over here. So
this is the email notification that we
sending to the prospect over here. Let
us test the hot leads
route here and see how it works. So to
do that here I'll execute the workflow
again.
And here we're going to fill out our
form with our full name email address.
We're also going to add our company name
and the industry that we're in.
Yeah. Approximately we have less than 15
workers, 15 employees. Challenge
challenge that we're facing is uh lead
generation. We're interested in
improving lead generation. Yes, we do
have a budget. We're looking to start
immediately and we heard about you guys.
We're performing a Google search. So

executed successfully and our on form
submission. We capture the lead data
that we that they submitted via our
form. So yeah, capture their full name,
work email, company name, industry,
number of their employees, challenges
they are facing, what they interested in
improving, if they have a budget, how
soon they're looking to start, and how
they heard about our
agency and then we're waiting a few
seconds to add the lead data to our
database.
So now when I open our lead sheet, you
can see we added a prospect right here.
We their full name, email address,
company name, industry, number of
employees, challenges they're facing, if
they have a budget, when they like to
start and how they heard about us. And
then using this AI lead scoring AI
agent, we are classifying the lead as a
hot lead because they're a perfect fit
in the automation service industry.
They're a small size company that aligns
with a typical target and has a budget,
immediate start timeline, and engage via
Google search indicating high intent and
