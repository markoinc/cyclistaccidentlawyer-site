hi everyone in this step-by-step
tutorial video I show you how I connect
chat GPT to Instagram Facebook and
WhatsApp I'll be using a tool called man
chat and you can follow along step by
step and build this together with me so
let's Jump Right In all right here we
are on manychat.com and we are going to
make a new account for this demo I'm
going to assume that you already have a
Facebook and an Instagram account if not
you can easily create them for free on
facebook.com and on the Instagram
smartphone app and for WhatsApp you
don't even need an account because we
will generate a new number inside the
app so what we'll be starting with is
just creating a man chat account to do
that we can just go here and click on
get started and now because we will
generate a certain type of messenger
first like let's say an Instagram chat
gbt integration it makes sense for us to
also log in with that particular account
so it's already the right one and we can
just click here on Instagram and connect
it automatically and in my case it now
forwarded me directly through the login
to my account page because I did that
before you might need to do a few
authentication steps but the process
will guide you through step by step and
in the end you'll also come to this site
all right once we are here we'll need to
connect to our chosen social media
channel and we're just going to start
with Instagram and do Facebook and
WhatsApp afterwards to do that we need
to go here on the left side in the
settings and here we can choose
Instagram and potentially if you chose
Instagram as your login option is
already connected but if not you can
select connect here and
connect
and as you see as easily as that it was
connected and now if I go to the
settings and select Instagram again
you'll see my account is connected and
available to be used here the next thing
that we do is we go here to the
automations Tab and we'll start by
creating a new
automation you see we have quite a lot
of templates here but what we are going
to do here is just start with a new
blank page from scratch all right and as
you see here the first thing we should
do is add a new trigger and for
Instagram we have quite a few here for
example user clicks an Instagram ad or
user clicks a referral link but the one
that I choose here is this one user
sends a direct message with a keyword
because this is very easy to control and
to test so let's select this and as as a
keyword we can for example say Instagram
chat GPT and we can of course use more
realistic keywords if we actually deploy
that but for testing purposes this is
good enough and we create the trigger
and here we are and the first thing we
want to do here is to test if that
actually works and to do that we'll here
create a new flow and create an
Instagram message and we can just type
something like Hello World
to test this at
first and so at this point we can set it
live and now let's jump over to
Instagram to see if that actually works
all right so here we are on Instagram
chatting with the account where we just
uploaded this Automation and one thing
you need to make sure is that you are
not chatting with that account from
itself because you can actually do that
on Instagram but you need to log into a
secondary account or use a friend's
account to actually check if that
automation works and so what we can now
do is just type that text that we
specified like Instagram chat GPT and
send it and once we do that we'll
receive the answer that we specified in
the chat bot as easily as that and with
that done let's jump back to man chat
and now add some AI magic to that whole
thing all right here we are back in mini
chat and before we get into build
building the chat gbt integration we
need to do three things the first one is
to activate our free trial because
integrating chat gbt actually requires
the pro version which in theory costs
$15 per month but luckily we can use it
14 days totally for free so just
activate that and try it out and make
sure to cancel the subscription before
the 15 days so you will never get
charged then the second thing thing we
need to do is that we need to generate
some Fields or variables where we can
store the input and output for chat gbt
and for that we go here in the settings
and we scroll down and here under
automation we have
fields and for that we can create new
user field I already have ai input and
AI output here but I'll show you how to
make new ones for example in this case I
could name it GPT input and this we can
all leave empty it's a user field and
click create and that's as fast as it is
and then also we do the same process
once more and this time just use GPT
output and create it and this step is
also done and now the third step that we
also need to do as a preparation is we
need to go down here to extension
and choose
Integrations and here we'll need to
connect to the chat gbt account and to
do that we'll need the open AI API key
and we get that from the website called
platform.
open.com ai- keys and I usually just
find that by Googling openai API key
whenever I need one again and then once
we are in this menu you can just create
a new one and call it man
chat and then the scripting number that
you get after you click here create
secret key is what you can copy and then
over here back in man chat you can just
paste it in and save it and of course
don't share it with anyone all right and
once that is also done we are now all
ready to integrate chat GPT into
Instagram for that let's go back to
automation and create a new automation
again we are starting from scratch and
we'll choose the same trigger as before
so here let's use the keyword magic just
to have something
different all right then the first thing
that we are going to do is we are going
to clear the input and output Fields
because we need these variables and we
don't want some all random values
floating around there and to do that
we'll choose actions here and we'll add
an action and we need this here clear
user field and is here for me because I
just used that but you can also find it
here under contact data and then select
it here clear user field and what we are
actually going to clear is the gbt input
and we're also going to do exactly the
same thing again and do that also for
the gbt output and so now we can start
with a blank slate then the next thing
is we need to actually ask the user to
type a question because remember they
will get in here by typing magic and
expect some kind of response it's not
that they just type magic and the
question together or magic and then a
separate message with a question but
they would want to get a prompt and then
answer to that and so for that purpose
we are now going to add a Instagram
message we are going to use the user
input field here and remove this uh text
field and we are just going to ask them
to prompt a
question and the response that they are
giving us we can save it here in this
field and we'll type GPT input because
that's exactly what this should be and
next we'll use this input and hand it
over to chap gbt to actually give us an
answer and for that we select actions
here and add a new action and we already
have it here make request but if it's
not here for you you can go in the left
menu here and choose chbt and here there
is only one option which is the one that
we choose then I'm going to select 3.5
turbo so we can just get a cheap
response and for better ones you can of
course select four but it's more
expensive
and here in the system prompt we'll go
to these curly brackets on the bottom
right and then we can just use the
custom user field GPT input which is
what the user is just typing in before
and we want to then have it processed
and in the end we store it in the field
GPT
output and we save and that should
already work now we want to make sure we
actually have an answer and if there is
no answer we want to apologize to the
user and make sure there is still a
message getting to him and to make sure
we can differentiate if we have an
answer or not we are going to add a
condition and that condition is the
custom user field GPT output and we are
going to check if it is
unknown and if it is actually unknown
that means we didn't get an answer from
here and in that case we can write a
message and say something like sorry I
can't answer your question and then we
can even repeat the question once more
so the user feels more understood in the
sense that the question is repeated and
then we can still ask would you like to
ask another
question and we can offer the option
yes and we can offer for the
option
no and in the other case if chat gbt
output is not unknown that means we were
successfully getting an answer and so in
that case we'll also show a message but
in this case we want to show the actual
answer which we find here in the
variable GPT output and then we can also
ask if the user would like to ask
another question
and we also offer the options
yes and the option
no and then if the user actually wants
to ask another question we can route
back here to the uh first action where
we clear the input and output so we
start again with a clean slate and we do
the same thing up here where we also ask
that same
question and if the answer is no then we
can just send a goodbye message to the
user and make sure that he is greeted
again in the end so for example thanks
see you next time for
example and we also connect this
here and once we're done we need to
press update here on the top right and
now we are ready to test this whole
thing again but in this case we are not
going to the web app because actually
the Instagram web chat doesn't know how
to deal with these buttons yes or no so
we need to do this in the app so let's
jump over there here is our Instagram
chat so let's type in the word magic
that we specified earlier and start this
automation right now we can ask a
question for example what is the capital
of Swit ser
land and
send and a second later we get the
answer with the option to ask more
questions or not let's try that as well
let's say
yes and let's also ask what is the
coolest city of
Sweetland
and a short moment later we get that
it's often considered to be Zurich and
so on and so forth which I probably
agree with but anyways that's not the
point here you see it works and if we
end the chat by pressing on no then
we'll get the greeting to say goodbye
and that was how we can integrate chat
gbt in Instagram with many chat next
let's see how we can do the same easily
with Facebook and WhatsApp and we don't
even need to stop start from scratch but
we can just copy our work that we
already did here for Instagram and to do
that we first need to connect man chat
with Facebook and also with WhatsApp and
we can do that again here in the
settings and in the settings we go here
to messenger and you just click the
connect button here and you will be
guided through everything if you want to
connect it to WhatsApp as well you go
here and you'll get the option to
connect it with your own number or to
purchase a new number for example I got
a new Us number here which costs 66
cents a month and you'll also be guided
through everything right here on this
page it's really easy and
straightforward so I'm not going to redo
it here but if you get stuck with this
feel free to ask a question in the
comments down below and I'll try my best
to help you great now once we've set up
messenger and WhatsApp in many chat we
can go back to our Instagram automation
that that we just
created which is here under Automation
and here we hover over this automation
so these three dots become visible we
click on them and then we can select
convert
channels and we select our channel here
like for example
Facebook we duplicate and
convert and you see it's slightly messed
up but we can just move this over here
and then it looks fairly okay and then
the only thing that we still need to do
here is to choose a new trigger so for
example the same that we used in
Instagram before is a direct message
with a keyword so we can also choose
that here and again I'm just going to
choose the keyword magic here that we
had before I'm going to create it and
then lastly we also need to set life
here and already now we have the
automation also ready on Facebook let's
go to that Facebook page and try it out
here I am on the page that I just made
and I'm going to click message here and
I'm just going to type magic and as you
see we have exactly the same interaction
that we had on Instagram before so what
is the capital of
Austria and in this case the buttons
actually work in the browser chat so no
need to use the smartphone to test this
and we can also select no and that was
it and lastly let's do the same also for
WhatsApp to do that we once again go
back to man chat we go to the automation
here and we can select either the
Facebook chat we just opened or the
Instagram chat from before we also click
on these three dots here convert
channels and this time we just select
WhatsApp and we duplicate and convert
same as last time we need to to fix the
trigger here so let's click at plus new
trigger and in WhatsApp as well we can
just start the interaction with a
keyword and let's also use magic and
create it and then once more we just
need to set it live such as here and
then go to our WhatsApp and in WhatsApp
I can just type our keyword magic again
and you'll see the exact same
interaction start
what is the capital of
Germany and here we also get the answer
that is Berlin we can ask another
question what is the coolest city of
Germany and here we get a more vake
answer but we get Berlin Hamburg Munich
and cologne which are all the big cities
who are the Diplomat IC answer but
anyways not the topic here so you see it
basically works exactly the same on
Instagram Facebook Messenger WhatsApp
and you can also do it on Telegram and
other services that are supported by
many chat great and now you know how you
can connect chat gbt with Instagram
Facebook messenger and WhatsApp if you
try implementing this and come across
any problems or uncertainties feel free
to leave a comment down below and I'll
try to help you and otherwise let me
know if you have any other topic that
you think I should cover I'd really
appreciate that as well thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye
