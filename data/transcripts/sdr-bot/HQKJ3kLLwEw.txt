What's up, lead gen beast? Matty eyes
here, leads for locals. In this video,
I'm going to walk you through step by
step how to create an AI appointment
booking bot inside of Highle using the
conversation AI feature. It is really,
really powerful. But you do want to make
sure you do it correct, guys. It's all
about the prompt. If you don't get the
prompt right, it's not going to do what
you need it to do. So, in this video,
basically what I want to do is share
with you what is working for me that I
that has literally taken me weeks of
testing to work out all the different
bugs to make sure that the AI agent does
what I want it to do. So, I I'm going to
share with you the exact prompt that is
working for me right now. Uh so, so that
it saves you guys a ton of time and a
ton of headache because it was kind of a
pain. Um so, just take my word for it.
All right. Um, but I'm also going to
show you how to connect it to your other
uh automations and workflows inside of
High Level because as uh as of right
now, at the time of this recording,
these AI agents are inbound only. Okay,
so basically what that means is we need
prospects to respond to one of our
automated text messages in order to
trigger the AI agents. All right, which
not a big deal because you should have
those automatic text messages going out
anyways. All right, but we're going to
restructure those text messages. Uh, and
I'm going to show you some very specific
examples so that it uh when people do
respond, it actually triggers the AI
agent. It takes over, it pre-qualifies,
and it books the appointment. All right,
so make sure you stick to the end, guys.
I'm going to show you step by step how
to put all of this in place. All right,
with that said, before we get started
real quick, if you find the video
helpful, guys, please hit that like
button. It really does help. Consider
subscribing because I come out with
these videos all the time. And if you
want to support the channel, if you
don't have HighLevel already, I will
have a 30-day free trial in the
description. It comes with a free Highle
boot camp as well. I really appreciate
the support, guys. All right, let's get
into it. Okay, so before we we create
the actual AI agents, you guys do want
to make sure that you have your
knowledge base uh created. All right,
and I did a separate video on this. I
will link it down below. Goes into a
little bit more detail. I'll do a quick
recap on it um very briefly uh because
it doesn't it doesn't take a ton of time
uh but basically the knowledge base is
what your AI agent will use to respond
basically to any questions or statements
that uh leads and prospects make. All
right. And it just it basically trains
your AI agent on your product and
service. All right. So, let me show you
an example here. All right. So, I'm
going to go to my annuity one here.
Actually, you know what? Let's do uh
let's do final expense because that's my
most recent one here. Final expense life
insurance. All right. And I have an FAQ
here where I basically copied and pasted
a bunch of question and answers. It's
like the most commonly asked questions
about final expense life insurance. I
had chat GPT put that together for me
and I just copied and pasted it into
high level. So if I scroll up to the
top, I just said, "Hey, provide a list
of the 20 most commonly qu asked
questions about final expense life
insurance." That's it. And then I copy
and pasted this into uh high level. If
you go to uh add source right here, FAQ,
you can copy and paste the question and
then the answer save. All right. So uh
and then from there I had uh chat GPT
put together a final expense guide right
here. Comprehensive guide that educates
people about final expense or bail
insurance, burial insurance, how it
works, etc., etc. And I copy and paste
all of this into a Google doc. Okay. And
then I take that Google doc. I share it.
Copy link. All right. And then we're
going to go to add source again. We're
going to do webcrawler.
And you paste in the URL. Extract data.
Good to go. All right. So that trains
your AI agent. That is very important.
You want to make sure your AI agent is
very familiar with your product and
service. All right. All right. Once you
have your knowledge base done, uh
because we're going to connect that
knowledge base to the AI agent here, uh
we're going to go back to conversation
AI up here at the top right. We're just
going to keep things simple and use
create promptbased bot. Uh I might do a
separate video on guided form setup.
It's a newer newer variation of creating
a conversation AI agent. One's not
necessarily better than another in my
experience. So, we're just going to use
the one that I'm familiar with right
now. We could do appointment booking. I
usually just start from scratch. All
right. Uh again, one's not better than
another. I just prefer to create from
scratch. All right. Bot settings. Uh
first things first, uh let's go ahead
and select autopilot. We want to make
sure that the bot automatically responds
when people uh respond to our text
messages, which I will show you here in
a minute. All right. The bot name is
going to be whatever you want. So, I'm
just going to do test Sarah. Okay. And
then uh right now what I'm doing for the
communication channels is just SMS and
Facebook. Uh SMS is going to be the
primary one. I leave Facebook on because
uh in my business we run a lot of
Facebook ads for clients. Uh especially
in life insurance, annuities, final
expense, etc. And uh we set it up so
that when people submit the form for the
Facebook ad, it also triggers a
conversation in Messenger. So people can
respond in uh Facebook Messenger as
well. So we want to have that option.
All right. And then uh let's scroll
down. All right. Uh business name. Just
go ahead and put your business name. I'm
going to put Millennial Wealth Creator
because that's my other YouTube channel
about building wealth. You guys want to
check it out. I'll link that down below
as well. All right. Autopilot mode. Wait
time before responding. I usually do 10
seconds. We don't want it too soon. We
don't want it too late. I like 10
seconds. You can do whatever you want.
Maximum messages. I would definitely
recommend 25. You're probably the AI
agent's probably never going to send
this many, but you want to have as many
as a high level will let us, which is 25
right now. Sendbot to sleep. Uh, when I
send a message manually or through a
workflow, I would recommend having this
on. We don't need two hours. I would
probably just do 10 minutes.
um just in case. And that's it. All
right, we're going to click save. Next,
we're going to go on to the training,
which is going to be simple because you
already have your knowledge base set up.
And if you don't get that set up really
quick, it doesn't take super long.
Should shouldn't take more than 30
minutes, if that. I'm going to select
the final expense knowledge base that I
have here already. It's going to bring
in the FAQs, the webcwler. Again, the
webcwler is just the the comprehensive
guide that I put together that trains
the AI agents on pretty much everything
like at least the main things that it
needs to know about the product and
service that we are advertising for. All
right. Uh we're going to save that.
Next, bot goals. Okay. This is where it
gets really fun, guys. Uh so, I'm going
to pull up my my uh Word doc here. I'll
probably link this down in the
description below unless you guys just
want to read off the page here really
quick. I'll I'll just I'll link a
document below for you guys to get this.
All right, because here's the thing is
this applies to just about any industry.
Of course, customize it to your own
specific business and whatever industry
that you're in, but the format itself
can work for just about any industry in
my experience so far. I've done it for
annuities, life insurance, final
expense, business loans. It works really
good. Okay, you just you just need to
customize it to whatever business you're
in, but the format works really good.
Okay. All right. The personality field.
Here we go. You are a bot for um I put
this custom value in. Uh high level
should automatically pull your company
name with this. But to be safe, I would
just replace this with your company
name. Okay. So, you're a bot for XYZ
company. You're tasked with gathering
information from prospects to see, in
this case, if an annuity would be a good
fit for their retirement by asking
questions provided in the additional
information section. Again, uh we're
being very specific here. You're going
to see how specific we are with certain
things as we continue throughout this
prompt, guys. It's very important that
you are as specific as possible. Okay.
Your primary goal, build trust. Ask
qualifying questions provided. Make sure
to use the provided knowledge base.
Okay, that is very very important. All
right, so uh I would just copy and paste
this into the bot uh or the personality
part of the bot. Anyways,
okay. Uh from there, uh next is intent.
All right, so we're going to go to
Whoops, there we go. Intent field. Your
goal is and again in this case we are
focused on annuities. I know we were
talking about final expense earlier, so
I'm kind of jumping all over the place,
but that is just to prove the point that
this can work for any industry. Okay.
Goal is to uh pre-qualify prospects who
are interested in getting a free custom
annuity income plan. Just insert
whatever your particular offer is. All
right. Uh by asking the questions in the
additional information section. All
right. So, we are going to copy that.
Oh, whoops. I guess I didn't do that. I
guess I didn't copy it.
Okay, there we go.
All right. And then from there,
additional information is definitely
going to be the more important one. This
is where we're going to ask the
questions and give it very specific
instructions about how to respond to the
initial message that people provide. So,
this man th this is probably what took
me a couple of weeks to get correct,
guys. This this was the real pain in the
rear end because so when you when you
have the AI agents, you're going to have
two different primarily two different
types of people that reach out to your
company. One, it's going to be people
that you're advertising to. Okay? So in
this case, we're running Facebook ads
for annuities. Uh we're offering a free
annuity guide and then we're offering
that free custom annuity income plan. Uh
so people are directly responding to
advertising that we are putting out
there. All right? But not everybody who
reaches out to your company uh or your
business page or whatever is going to
respond to advertising. They're going to
come from different sources. All right?
So as an example, we don't want people
like we don't want our bot to say this.
Okay? So the first message when someone
says why start a quote. Okay, this is me
telling it that this is somebody that's
coming from an advertising campaign.
Okay, and I I'm very clear about that.
They are uh responding to a message from
the company to request this particular
product, this particular offer. Okay?
And then I tell it to start the
conversation with something like this.
Thanks for reaching out and requesting
this custom plan to make sure it's a
good fit for you. I just need to ask a
few basic questions, then ask the first
question. Okay, but not everybody is
going to respond with why start or
quote. Some people will ask a question
right off the bat or make a statement
come from a completely different
marketing channel. Okay, so if somebody
asks, "Hey, do you guys um also help
with life insurance?" Right? We don't
want the bot to say, "Hey, thanks for
reaching out and requesting a free
custom annuity income plan." That
wouldn't make sense, right? That
wouldn't be congruent. That'd be pretty
bad. Okay? Very bad first impression.
So, the next part of the prompt is if
someone starts a conversation in any
other way and then give it an example,
guys, with a question or a full
statement, then answer their question.
Address the statement using the
knowledge base and information about the
business provided. do your best to try
and get them to request whatever it is
your offer is. Then ask the first
question. Okay. When I added this part
of the prompt, that was a game changer
for me. Okay, that made all the
difference in the world. All right. Um,
this stuff right here is uh the template
from high level. I believe that's uh
what's already in here. So, we can just
we can keep that. It's it's pretty good
stuff. We don't need to worry about it
too much. All right. So, that's fine. Uh
but then after that I also have it asked
the uh the following questions. Ask one
question at a time. Wait for a response
before asking the next question. Here
are the questions. Obvious like there's
nothing special about these questions,
guys. It's basically the top three
questions you would normally ask
somebody when you would get somebody on
the phone. Like what what's the the most
important the the top three most
important pre-qualifying questions with
what you do? That's what we're going to
do here. and it's only three um at the
moment. That's just what Highle limits
us to. It's different if you were to do
the other version of creating the bot,
but again, I just I like creating it
from scratch using the original. Um I
think asking three questions is plenty
uh to get started. Anyways, all right.
So, you're going to ask the the top
three primary questions regarding your
product and service. Just the the basic
information that you would need. All
right. This is what the the the bot will
uh finish up with. Okay. After they
answer the final question, thanks for
answering those questions. Your next
step, choose a day and time. Uh can I
send you a few options? They'll say yes.
Uh this is really important, guys,
because this part of the prompt right
here because if you don't add this, then
the bot sends a million freaking
options, okay? It sends the basically
the entire availability of the calendar,
which is not good. that's going to
overwhelm the person. It it's not
professional. So, uh, when I added this
again, it it made a huge difference. So,
I told it when you provide calendar
options, make sure to provide two
different dates with an AM and a PM
option for both. Ask me why I'm so
specific about that because it was the
only way to get it to do what I needed
it to do, guys. All right, so u let's
head back. I want to um I'm actually
gonna uh let's see. No, I'm not going to
cancel it because we do need to do some
other things here. Um, but that um that
right there is the prompt. Okay, I'm I'm
I'm going to test this here in a second
so you can see exactly how it works and
then I'll show you how to connect it to
uh the various different workflows. Oop,
sorry. Hang on one second. Did not mean
to do that. That was a YouTube video.
All right. Now, down here at the bottom,
uh we're going to click on appointment
booking. And we want to obviously select
the calendar. This part's pretty easy.
We're going to do annuity consultation.
You're just going to select the calendar
that you want the AI agent to book the
appointment on. All right. Uh don't send
uh I don't think I check any of these.
Um don't don't book appointment. Only
send a booking link. I'm not a big fan
of that. I'd rather the AI agent
actually book the appointment within the
text message. I don't like sending links
in text messages um if I can avoid it.
All right. Uh allow the bot to cancel.
I'm okay with that. Allow the bot to
reschedule. I'm okay with that as well.
Uh let's see. Transfer employee. We
don't need that. Uh I mean this is going
to be customizable of course uh
according to your business. Um but I
don't typically turn any of these on. Um
I guess you could pause the bot after
booking. I don't think that's a huge
deal though. Okay. Uh but anyways, the
most important thing is I I mean I
usually turn these two on and then just
make sure you select the correct
calendar. All right. So we're going to
save that.
Now, uh, and this is why, uh, I'm I'm a
big fan of the traditional bot setup
because we have a lot of different
options here. Um, you could trigger, uh,
different workflows, uh, which I think
is really, really powerful. Uh, but add
contact info, that's going to be really
important because we are asking custom
questions here, right? So, if we scroll
back up, uh, let's, um, let's make this
a little bit more visible.
Let's see. Let's scroll this down. There
we go. Okay. Now, if we scroll, where's
uh where's our questions? Did I not copy
paste it? I don't think I did. Let's do
that really quick. Let's do additional
info. All right. Because when we are
asking those custom questions
like right here, okay, we want to have
the bot update custom fields with the
prospect's answers to these questions,
right? That's really good information to
have for the appointment. All right. So,
what we need to do is create a custom
field for each one of these questions.
This is why I like to have two tabs of
highle open. It's going to make our jobs
a lot easier when setting this up. So, I
have another tab of highle open here.
We're going to go to custom fields.
All that information was fake, guys. So,
don't even try to send me an email or
contact me. uh at least with that
information. Of course, you can send an
email u with what I provide on the
channel, Facebook group, etc. But
anyways, all right, we're going to go to
custom fields and we need to create a
custom field for each of the uh three
questions. All right, so we're going to
add field. We're going to do single
line. Click next. Okay, and our first
question, all right, was in about how
many years are you looking to retire?
Now, I already have these created, okay?
But you would um usually like the way
I've been doing it anyways is I've been
putting AI
annuity dash
um years until retirement. Whatever is
going to This is really uh whatever's
going to help you guys stay organized.
Okay. And then group is going to be
additional info. This is the section
that you would go to under the contact
profiles. You would click the additional
info tab when you're in the contact
profile to see the answer to this
question. Okay? And then you would save.
And then we're going to uh I'm not going
to save it now because I already have
it, but we're going to add another
field, a single line, and you're going
to repeat the process for each one of
these questions. All right? You're just
going to create a custom field for each
question. Okay?
Now, once you do that, then we're going
to click on add contact info. And this
is where we're going to have the AI bot
update that custom field inside of the
contact profile. So you have that
information when the person um answers
them, answer the questions, and then you
have it for when you uh call for the
appointment. All right. So action name.
Again, we want to stay organized here.
So in this example,
we'll put years until retirement.
And then the field to be updated is
going to be the one that you just
created. I already have them here. All
right. Uh I think I named it uh yeah,
annuity retirement time frame. Okay.
What to update? All right. It's going to
be uh how
we'll just put years until the prospect
wants to retire or is looking to retire,
whatever. Okay. Uh output example. We do
want to provide a couple of examples.
All right. Uh, just to make sure that
the AI agent knows what to put in the
contact field. So, what here's the
thing. Come up with think about three
different ways that somebody might
answer this question. Okay. So, if I
were to ask somebody, how many year uh
what was my question again? It was
uh how many years are you looking to
retire? Okay. So, somebody might say 10
years.
Okay. Okay, let's click add another
uh they might say already retired.
Okay, maybe they're not sure. Maybe
maybe add an extra one. And we put five
to 10 years. Okay, just give it a few
examples. All right, then we're going to
click save. All right, and from there
we're going to add new field. And you're
going to repeat the same exact process
for the other questions. All right, give
it a name. Select the contact field.
What what's like what is the AI agent
going to put in that field and then give
it a couple examples. That's all you're
going to do, guys. Okay.
All right. Once you do that, then your
AI bot is actually ready. So, click
save. And what do you say we test this
thing? All right. Uh let me make sure
everything is in place as as I need it
and then we'll go ahead and test it.
Give me one second.
All right, guys. We're good to go. Okay.
So over here on the right hand side, we
are actually able to test our bot, which
is pretty sweet. So we can get an idea
if this thing is working or not. So
let's do the let's do the perfect case
scenario where somebody replies exactly
how we want them to reply. All right, so
let's click why uh because we're going
to put that in our uh automatic text
messages later on um once we put our
workflows together. All right, so
somebody replies with Y, start, quote,
whatever. All right. Um, and it's going
to it's going to give us the exact
response that we told it to give. So,
when we uh go back to additional info
right here, if someone responds with why
start a quote, what do we what did we
tell it to say? Thank you for reaching
out and then ask the first question.
That's exactly what it did. All right.
So, so far so good. First, in about how
many years are you looking to retire?
Let's do 10 years.
It should go to the next question. Very
good. Great. Thanks for sharing that.
Next, how much guaranteed monthly income
are you looking to create? Let's do
5,000.
Thank you. About how much of your
portfolio would you be able to allocate
to an annuity to create that amount of
income? And again, these are all
questions. These are the exact questions
that I gave it in the additional
information part of the prompt, guys.
Okay. About how much of your portfolio?
Um, let's do let's do a 100,000. Okay.
And let's see what it does next.
Okay. Thanks for answering those
questions. And the next part of the
prompt is uh is basically getting
permission to send a few options to book
the appointment. Okay. For uh to talk to
a state licensed professional, provide
your custom plan once it's complete,
etc. All right. So, we're going to click
yes.
Okay. Ah, this is awesome. It's such a
beautiful thing. Uh, because guys,
before I, like I said, before I put this
part of the prompt in, it would send me
like 20 different options to choose
from. It was ridiculous. All right, so
I'm telling you, when if it if you're
trying to set up an appointment booking
bot, this part of the prompt is really
important. All right, here are a few
options for your appointment. all in
Pacific time zone. Thursday the 3rd at
5:30 or 6:00 p.m. Friday 4th of July 20
8 a.m. or 5:30 p.m. So it's giving an aa
uh an AM option and a PM option. Which
of those works best for you? Okay. And
then I would give it an option. Uh and
then it would it would book the
appointment on the calendar. It is
freaking awesome. This this prompt it
works guys. Okay. Now, the next thing I
want to show you is I mean this this
part is it's not too complicated. Like
you guys should probably you probably
already have this part in place, but how
do we get somebody to actually engage
with the bot? Because again, the these
are inbound AI agents. So, we need
people to respond to this. So, we need
to make sure that we have automatic text
messages going out on a regular basis
prompting people to respond in this way.
All right. All right. So, let me show
you guys how I have that set up. It's
pretty it's pretty basic. I don't think
it's anything special. It's basically
whenever somebody opts in for whatever
my lead magnet is at the time, we're
going to send text messages
um you know, thanking them and say,
"Hey, check your email for XYZ lead
magnets, but you know, reply to this
message with Y to see if you qualify for
an annuity or whatever." All right. So,
let's go to
uh let's see. Annuity guide opt-in.
I'm pretty sure that's the one I have
here
or the one I have it set up then. Uh
let's see. Let's go to the text message.
Yes, there we go. Okay. So, one of the
ad campaigns that I run in my one of my
marketing systems, uh, which if you guys
want a pre-made marketing and lead
generation system for annuities, final
expense, life insurance, whether you're
a licensed agent or you're marketer in
that uh, industry and you want a
pre-made marketing lead generation
system with the pre-made Facebook ad
campaigns, highle system, funnels,
automations, all that, drop a comment
down below and I'll send it to you.
Anyways, when somebody opts in for our
lead magnets, okay, we're going to get
name, email, and phone number. And then
the first text that we're going to send
is basically thanking them for
requesting our free lead magnets. It
should be in your email shortly. Check
your spam folder just in case. Also,
make sure to request your free plan
uh as well to get a personalized road
map for using annuities. You can either
complete the questionnaire in the email
or right here, reply to this message
with the letter Y to use our automated
system. So, we're giving them two
options. Um, a lot of people actually
just uh complete the questionnaire, but
we want to give them an option to uh
interact with our AI agent as well, so
that our AI agent will pre-qualify, ask
questions, book the appointment, good to
go. All right. So, I basically what I
did, guys, was I just I adjusted the
text messages that were that I was
already sending to people and I just
added this last part right here. I just
adjusted this really. Um, all of this
kind of stayed the same. This is what I
changed at the end. You can either
complete the questionnaire, which is
what I was doing anyways, but now that
AI is available, I'm giving them a
second option to reply to this message
and I'm giving very specific
instructions on how to use the automated
system. That's it, guys. And when you
add this when somebody replies with why,
start, quote, whatever it is that you
want to do or use to trigger the AI
agent. That's it. All right. Now, I do
like to cover my bases, though. I'm
going to show you one more workflow that
I put together. Um, you shouldn't need
this, but like I said, I like to have a
fail safe in place just in case things
don't work. You know, it's not perfect.
Um, I think this is it right here. my AI
um qualification trigger uh bot trigger.
Yes, it's um I like to have a workflow
in place that will trigger the bot when
somebody replies to a workflow. Okay, so
let me show you an example. All right,
so I'll create a workflow and the
trigger will be u customer replied. All
right, and I just give it the name and
it's going to be a reply channel of SMS.
The workflow is going to be annuity
guide opt-in because that's where the
leads are coming in from and being sent
to. I should say that when a lead is
generated, they're automatically put
into this workflow. Okay? And then that
workflow, which I was just showing you,
it has the text messages that go out.
Okay?
People will respond to that text with
why, start, quote, whatever you decide
to use. All right? So, these are my
three filters. There's the reply channel
replied workflow and then contains
phrase why right here. All right. And
then my action is update conversation AI
bot and status. And then I choose my
annuity bot and change it to active.
Okay. Like I said, you probably don't
need this. I just like to have it in
place just in case because you never
know. All right. And I want to make sure
that my AI bot works when somebody
actually responds to one of my text
messages. Okay, with that said, guys, I
think I'll go ahead and wrap up there.
That is just about it. Um, let's see.
Let me just double check. Um, let's go
back to the AI bot. I want to make sure
I did not miss anything for you guys.
All right. Um, you can go to the
dashboard to see basically the
engagement it's having with all of your
prospects. U, that's a separate video.
Don't really don't really need to go
through that. Anyways, uh, bot training
is very simple. bot settings. Very
simple. Bot goals. This is where the
magic really happens. You want to make
sure that you get the prompt right. I
will link to this particular prompt uh
in the description or I might just paste
it in the description. Uh that's
probably easier for you guys. You guys
can just copy and paste it from this
video. All right. Uh from there, you
just want to make sure that you're
you're connecting your custom fields for
the questions that you're asking. Make
sure you uh connect your calendar. And
that's it, guys. You are good to go.
That's what uh took me weeks of testing
to figure out. So hopefully that helps
you out a little bit. Uh if you guys
have any questions or get stuck on
anything, have any feedback, uh any
requests for uh specific videos, drop a
comment down below. Would love to engage
with you guys. As always, uh I hope you
guys are crushing it and I will talk to
you in the next one. To your success,
Matty Ice is out.
