Unknown caller.
>> Hi, am I reaching Charlie?
>> Yeah, this is Charlie. Can I book an

>> Sure, Charlie. To get started, can you
please confirm uh your email address?
This will help me check if we have your
contact information on file.
>> Yeah, my email is charlie@systemkit.io.
>> Could you please provide your full name?
>> Yeah, Charlie Barber.
>> Thank you, Charlie. Uh, your contact
information has been created uh
successfully. Could you please let me
know your preferred date and time uh for
the appointment?
>> Yeah. What times do you have available
tomorrow?
>> We have the following time slots
available for tomorrow. October 31st,
9:30 a.m. 10:00 a.m. 10:30 a.m. 11:00
a.m. 11:30 a.m.
>> Okay, let's do 11 a.m., please.
>> Your appointment has been successfully
booked for tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. You
should receive a confirmation email
shortly. Is there anything else I can
help you with today, Charlie? No, that's
it. Thank you very much and have a great
day. Okay, so let's quickly refresh the
page to see if it's managed to send us
an appointment and you're going to see
how easy it is to actually build this
Vappy and GHL um thing. So, you can see
right there, 11:00 a.m. Perfect on the
calendar. So, there's no messing about.
The absolute first thing I'm going to do
is put a timer on the screen and show
you how easy it is to build this in
under 10 minutes. And if I don't manage
to build this in under 10 minutes, I
will stop posting YouTube videos
forever. And that's how confident I am
because if you don't know, Vappy have
added GHL as an integration on their
platform, which means we don't need
nat.io anymore. We don't need make.com.
We can do it all inside Vappy and it
takes a literal few minutes. So once you
have headed onto Vappy.ai, you are going
to create a free account by clicking
sign up. But I've already got an
account. So I'm going to click on open
dashboard. And as soon as you click on
open dashboard, you want to go down to
where it says assistance. So let's give
it a second. You can see we clicked on
assistance at the uh you know left and
we're going to create an assistant. We
are going to call this uh let's do demo
for YouTube. So demo demo for YouTube.
You can call this whatever you want. So,
if you're building like a yoga, you
know, AI voice agent or a med spa,
dentist, chiropractor one, you would
just put the assistant name as that. It
doesn't really matter. Just click on
blank template and click create an
assistant. Once you've done that, we are
going to then head over to tools. Now,
if you aren't aware, we can actually
create tools. And this works for both
Google calendar and the GHL calendar.
So, if you don't have GHL, you can still
use this for Google Calendar. And it's
the exact same kind of principle and
setup. So, you're going to click on
create tool. And you can see that you
get all of these different options. And
you can see that we're going to create
um four tools. So, we want to get a
contact. So, when you know it picks up
the phone, we want to essentially see if
they're in our database. And you don't
really need to um click on anything
besides use customer phone number. Um,
and this will just make sure when it's
calling the actual customer, it can use
their number without um, kind of the AI
voice agent having to ask them for their
number if that makes sense. But you
don't really need to understand this.
You just need to click on create tool
and just put these four tools. The next
one is uh, create a contact and once
again just click on use customer phone
number. It's really this easy. Click on
create tool again and just do that for
check availability. So, we wanted to
check the availability um on our
calendar. And once again, you can use
this for Google calendar or GHL or any
other calendar for that fact. It's the
exact same thing. And all we need to do
is actually add our calendar ID. So, if
you have a GHL sub account, you can find
this calendar ID by going down at the
bottom left in your GHL sub account. Um
and then going down to where it says
calendars here on the left. And
obviously we give out GHL in our
community, but you can just get your own
GHL if you want. And it's really this
simple to the point where you just want
to copy this ID and go back into Vappy
and just paste in the ID right here. And
for the time zone, just put the time
zone you want. We're going to keep it in
America, New York time zone. And once
again, you can leave all of this blank.
Just click save and you're good to go.
And the final one is just a actual uh
event. So it's going to create the
actual booking. And once again, just
copy and paste the calendar um ID. And I
just didn't mention this, but if you
don't have a calendar, you can just
click on new calendar, choose any of
them. It doesn't matter. Let's do
personal booking. Name your calendar,
select a team member, the you know slug
or the custom URL, the meeting duration,
and then you'll get a calendar ID right
here. It is really simple to create a
calendar in JHL. takes like 30 seconds.
Um, so then once you've done that, we
have successfully created the four tools
and we're going to be connecting these
tools to our assistant in a minute. But
the next thing you need to do is head
over down to where it says more and
click on integrations. And we actually
need to connect GHL to Vappy. And we do
that by scrolling all the way down. You
can see how um easy this is. We've
scaled a bit too far down. Um, it should
be here somewhere. So you can see that
there are two options to connect GHL to
Vappy. We have this one and then we also
have this one. I recommend you you only
really need to do this one, but I've
done this one just in case. And you can
find your API key by going into your sub
account and clicking on business
profile. And then you can basically
either generate a um a new API key by
clicking on uh this one or you can just
copy it if you already have one. and you
would just paste it in um right here.
So, it's really that simple. Um and I'm
going to actually disconnect this and do
it as if I were doing it from scratch.
So, this is the most important part. You
need to actually click on connect. And
once you click on connect, it's going to
give you um if you click on next, it's
going to give you the option to actually
um select an account. Now, you do not
select the agency account. You want to
select the sub account you want to use
this AI agent and booking agent for
basically. So in this case you can see
our sub account is called YouTube
demonstration. So what we going to do is
go back here and click on YouTube
demonstration and you'll be able to see
that we can find it right here. And once
we found it right there, it's going to
connect automatically. So we've got GHL
connected to Vappy. Everything's good to
go. All we need to do now is go to the
assistant we created. So if you remember
I created the assistant at the start
called demo for YouTube. Um obviously
you can play around with the voice. You
probably have a lot more time than I do.
Um you also have the first message. So
this could be like hello am I reaching
let's say Charlie. So that is the
dynamic variable if you want to use
that. And then the easiest part for this
is actually just connecting the tools.
And you do that by selecting the ones
we've just created. So boom, we've
selected the yeah four that we just
made. If you even remember, we just did
that. Um, we aren't going to publish it
yet because what we want to do is
actually add a system prompt. And the
beautiful thing about this is Vappy has
made it so like insanely simple to the
point where they have a documentation
for this. So if you go to this URL,
which you can see, so docs.vapy.ai,
we've got a few minutes left tools/glum
or go high level. You can actually
scroll down and you'll be able to find a
system prompt. So, they've got all the
instructions here that I'm just going
through. Like, it's really simple. Um,
but what we can do is just copy this and
then paste this in right here. So, let's
paste this in right here. And you can
see that this is perfect. Um, you can
obviously add a a knowledge base of your
company just by uploading like a file
like a PDF. So, you can create a Google
document, download it with all your
information. You can obviously change
the voice. So, play around with the
voice. You know, obviously I recommend
using 11 Labs. They've got the best AI
voices um in my opinion in the market.
And yeah, now you just click publish. I
recommend testing or sorry, yeah,
testing it by clicking talk to
assistant. And you'd be able to do that.
Um but in this case, what we want to do
is actually run like an outbound
campaign. So, how you would do that in
literally a minute is by clicking on
this more button and then going down to
where it says outbound. And what you can
do is click on create a campaign and you
can literally call this like BTOC.
Let's do like B2C um let's just call it
B2C campaign. So you want to select the
phone number. You obviously do need a
phone number which I didn't mention but
obviously you can get that inside Vappy.
Super simple. It's like a dollar or I
think it's free even if if you're in the
US. If you're outside the US and you
want to get a phone number into Vapy,
use Twilio. It's really simple. Um and I
can even make a video on that in the
future. Just comment if you want that.
Um, so yeah, UK number is the one we're
going to be using. And then all you want
to do is select the assistant. So, uh,
this is the one we've just created. And
we have, um, the CSV. So, for the CSV,
all you want to do, we've got like 2
minutes left. I'm confident we can do
this. Um, go down to where it says
Google Sheets, and you just want to
follow the same kind of template that
they give you. And I, let's click
download. So this template looks like
this. So file, import. Let's just um
Yeah. So we want to make sure that it is
like the same format if that makes
sense. Otherwise, it won't work. But you
can literally just have like hundreds of
numbers and you're just going to uh
launch this campaign in a second and
it's going to be amazing. So yeah,
number. So let's uh yeah, delete this.
Let's replace this one with Charlie. And
I apologize if I'm going fast, but I
want to make this um yeah, easy for you
guys. So, I'm just going to put my one
of my numbers here. Hopefully, this is
right. If it's not right, then I'm
screwed. Uh 97158
55660. Yeah. So, that should be correct.
Download this. So, file, download. Um go
back here. We're just going to import
this. So, I believe it's this one.
Hopefully.
Yeah. So, it should be this one. You can
see that's perfect. Let's just launch
campaign. So, it's on send now and
within a second we are going to get a
phone call. I've got a team member
texting me for some reason. Um, but this
should work. If it doesn't, then I'm
sorry, guys. But there we go. We've got
a number. Let's uh answer this.
>> Hello. Am I reaching Charlie?
>> Yes, this is Charlie. Can I book an
appointment, please? I've got 30
seconds.

time instead?
>> Yeah, let's do 1:30 p.m.
>> Okay, byebye.
>> Okay, so I'm not going to lie, guys. It
was 10 seconds over 10 minutes. However,
I didn't say that we we did I didn't say
we had to test it in that like 10
minutes, if that makes sense, because I
had a fully functioning AI agent that
you can see books an appointment for
9:30. Um, and I did that in under 10
minutes. So, yeah, drop a like guys,
subscribe, and um, whatever else you
want on this channel, just let me know
