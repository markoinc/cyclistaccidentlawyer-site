okay in this video I'm going to share
with you how you can build an AI
appointment booking bot in go high level
so what this means is that you can have
a 24/7 365 days a year let your employee
like it's like having an employee in
your agency or business um that can just
Hammer DMS basically or messages or text
messages and just book meetings or sell
your service or product for you so
appointment seters or virtual assistants
are like out of date like one of the
main problems I had when it came to vas
and hiring virtual assistants to do like
appointment setting for me was they are
inconsistent they're lazy and they're
also expensive um you can get cheaper
ones for like $3 an hour but you get the
point why would you have that when you
can literally have a 24/7 like AI bot on
your inbound social media channels to
just handle all the lead flow for you or
your clients so that is the best part
about this video is that not only can
not only am I going to show you how to
build this for yourself I'm also going
to show you how you can do this for your
clients um because it's the same thing
um I would obviously recommend you learn
how to do this for yourself first and
then your clients um but yeah it's going
to be a very valuable video so I'm going
to show you two variants that you can
build in go high level today after this
video um the first one is for beginners
and it's way more simple to understand
because we're going to be using the chat
gbt inside Goa level so it's just a lot
more simple basically um and the other
one is more like Advanced it's one of
the best ones in the market but it's a
bit confusing to set up you need web
hooks you need to use a third party
software like zapia you need uh chat gbt
um 4 ideally with the open AI key and
then we link that to zapia so the second
one gets a lot more complicated but the
first one um is what I'm going to start
with just so if you're a beginner and
you're new to high level you're new to
automation maybe you run an agency um I
don't know but yeah this is what what
it's going to consist of so yeah this is
using go level chat gbt I'm now going to
show you a live walk through of the
workflow um and automation so if we go
to this workflow now if you have high
level then you would basically go to
your automation part and you would
basically click create
workflow um and then start from scratch
but if you already um have a workflow
you can just basically name it whatever
you want um this is just an example so
first of all you need a trigger now if
you're new to high level right a trigger
is how we start the automation now if
you're looking for like an outbound um
AI booking you know software whatever
then you can't really use this for that
you would need Auto igdm or another one
of these like um outbound softwares but
this is mainly for inbound um if you run
ads or if you are creating content which
every one of you watching this should be
creating content um attention is
literally the most important thing in
2024 but this is what you'd want to set
up onto your Instagram your Facebook
your SMS um all that stuff so what you
want right is you want um the trigger to
be customer replied now you can call
this doesn't really matter um and the
reply Channel you can select literally a
bunch of different things Facebook
Instagram SMS even WhatsApp um so
wherever you're get wherever you're
getting your like inquiries you can just
put that as the trigger contains the
phrase so you could put this as like um
hi can I get more information or can I
learn more about what you're doing or a
certain keyword that you could put in
your Facebook or Instagram bio um it
doesn't really matter you get the point
you can put whatever you want here and
you can even add more so you can add a
exact match phrase if you were to put
like keyword um and yeah that's that
basically and that will allow the
trigger to to or so the automation to
actually start and then carry out with
all this good stuff so yeah you click
save trigger make sure you constantly
save your workflow as well um and then I
like to have a wait of 1 minute now the
reason I have this is to make it look a
bit more natural because if the AI bot
responds like automatically within a
second you can tell or the prospect can
tell it's a bot so I like to wait a
minute or 2 minutes um ideally no longer
than 2 minutes because the whole point
of this is to have a um a dialed in
appointment seter that is 24/7 the speed
to lead is like very quick which means
that um we can keep the actual Prospect
in a conversation instead of them going
elsewhere or going to another you know
social media platform we want to keep
them actually engaged so a minute is The
Sweet Spot of what I found um and then
you basically want to put your Instagram
DM as just whatever you want um in the
actual thing so if it's a free lead
magnet in which you're getting people to
DM you you so that's what i' would
recommend you would create some type of
free resource a free pdf a free training
and then you would put that in your bio
and you would say DM me the word I don't
know grow or scale or meeting and I'll
send you something that your Niche wants
basically um and then you basically give
that to them in this message here um and
then what you would do is you would wait
so you'd wait for contact reply meaning
that we want them to reply to this um DM
and you could also put in this DM like
did you get it or is this what you were
looking for just to provoke a response
because once we get a response we then
put a condition so a condition is
basically an if or else now what this
means is that if the lead responds it's
going to do one thing and if the lead
doesn't respond then it's going to do
another thing so we must have a
condition here because obviously you
want to do certain things but if the
lead responds in a set way so what I
I've done is I've created two branches
which is very simple um the first branch
is lead replied equals true and once
again you can um what's it called yeah
actually implement this into your
workflow as you're like watching this so
I don't know maybe have another tab open
and just like go through this workflow
and build it um it's very simple stuff
the second uh AI bought is going to be
like way more advanced and like way
better um that basically it can just
respond like in a way more like a more
human Mana basically um and by the way
if you want like this just completely
done for you then DM me on Instagram and
I will also give you like the um the
prompts as well to actually what to put
into the um chat gbt which I'll talk
about in a second so yeah anyway let's
get back into this um yeah actually DM
me like I don't know just say you want
the thing I'll probably put a keyword in
the bio um sorry in the description the
first link and yeah yeah if you do that
then I'll just DM you back uh how to get
access to this built out for you
basically for a lot cheaper than
actually paying for high level which is
probably what you want um but anyway so
yeah essentially two branches this one
so You' put contact replied equals true
this one contact replied equals false
You' put the thing as contact replied
and then false pretty easy to understand
then if they don't respond to the
initial message it's going to wait 24
hours and it's going to send an
Instagram DM saying hey and you can even
change this to first name if you put
custom values contact first name now
it's going to say hey James or whatever
their name is did you get a chance to
check out whatever you sell the free
training or the the lead Magna I'm
actually going to save that cuz that's
what I want it to be but yeah and then
once again it's going to wait and then
it's going to do the same thing it's
going to see if the lead responds if
they did respond we've put a go-to
action which um means that it's going to
take them to this part if you know the
lead did respond originally it's going
to do what it would that uh do basically
and if they didn't respond I probably
should put another followup here but
haven't done that but yeah if they um
did respond to the initial free lead
magnet then you basically want to put a
prompt here so you are an appointment
set on Instagram the lead has reached
out um and you've given uh the free lead
magnet your job is to have a friendly
conversation and ask the simple
questions that I'll give you below once
the they respond to the free lead magnet
you would say are you working towards
any goals or whatever and for the
temperature you'd want to put this as
like
0.2 um the reason for that is we want to
make it more um focused and
deterministic instead of more random so
if we were to put like 0.8 basically the
higher you go or the closer you get to
one the more random the uh the actual
chat gbt is going to respond so we want
it to be as focused as possible so it's
I want it to actually say what I've put
here so you can do even No.1 basically
that's what I would recommend or .2 um
and then you would basically go to
Instagram DM so how you would do this is
um I don't know why I don't I don't
really want to delete this but you would
basically yeah click Send Instagram DM
and then you would go to custom values
you would click chat gbt and you would
put the hasht one which links here send
a prompt to uh chat gbt Ai and then it's
basically going to do the response that
you you gave the The Prompt basically
and then it's going to wait 24 hours and
then guess what we've got a condition
just like what we've got here just like
what we've got here um so an if or else
condition this one says um nothing so
far and this one says the lead hasn't
responded so you're going to say hey did
you get a chance to check out the free
Bid or whatever you want there I just
wanted to demonstrate how this works
put the chat GPT fre response so it must
link with the the same hashtag here make
sure it does that and then this one
should say chat gb2 uh chat gbt2
response once again linking with the
hashtag there so that is like the most
simple chat gbt AI booking B that you
can make basically um it's pretty easy
to understand you have a trigger you
have um you put the prompt in here like
it's super easy you can basically click
here go down here to um chat gbt put in
your prompt then you would for this
Instagram DM you would click here you
would click uh send Instagram DM so here
Instagram DM you would go here you would
go here and then click this one super
simple um and for the condition in case
you don't know how to do this you would
type if or else and then you've got your
branch once you've done this so if lead
responds true you would colle uh put
contact replied equals true and then you
would create another Branch um with the
false basically option then contact
replied equals false now let's get into
the actual like a way better version of
this but I wanted to include this in
this video just in case you're
completely new to this basically and you
um haven't what's it called done this
before and also if you get people stuck
in this weight option you can basically
just click here and move all the leads
into the next step so now it's going to
do follow-ups for you basically basally
if they get jammed which sometimes
happen but nonetheless now let's talk
about the second booking B which is
using chat gbt 4 zapia and Goa level so
the reason we use this or the best use
case for this is if we want a way more
indepth and accurate but like a human so
we want it to actually be like a way
more advanced version that can have a
more flow to the conversation um and
it's just a lot more reliable and
doesn't
um yeah break or doesn't know what to
say sometimes this one is like the best
of the best basically but the problem is
that it's quite difficult to set up if
you're a beginner so that's why I'd
recommend starting with this one and
then transitioning into this one um but
how you would do this is You' basically
need to have or you would need to go
into your open AI so you would create an
open AI account you would um go to the
API section um and you kind of want chat
G4 for this and then you would want to
go to assistant um and click create you
would have your name instructions
model um and then this stuff but for the
instructions this is your prompt so
instead of using high levels um chat gbt
like you can see here what we're going
to do is we're going to use a
third-party software in this case it's
going to be zapia to connect open AI so
we're going to have to get the API key
and we're going to have to connect that
to zapia um and then then that will be
the web hook to high level basically um
lead connector so for this instructions
what you would want to do is you would
want to um get the uh I think it's
essentially this one this is what I
probably found to work best so yeah You'
put in your details and You' basically
just need to um fill in what you want
but if you don't have any qualifying
questions in your um appointment setting
standard operating procedure then it's
going to be a lot easier cuz you can
just remove like the disqualifying
criteria you can remove um yeah the like
all this stuff and you can basically
just like have it a lot simpler but you
basically just copy and paste this into
the assistant click save as you can see
I've already done it here so it's pretty
simple um and then You' essentially want
to test it in playground so you could
say like hi who is
this okay okay I think I was meant to
click run not enter but um it should
just respond so hi there my name is
Charlie from agency start are you
interested in Booking an appointment
with us so you can see how that works a
lot more efficiently um and if I were to
click right uh yeah sure I don't know if
it's actually going to send this cuz I
don't think I put in my calendar link
but um I don't know maybe it will say
something um awesome I'll be asking you
some qualifying questions about our
services to determine the best
appointment for you this should take a
few minutes and can be completed uh via
text can we start if I have to put yes I
I haven't actually given the prompt any
um qualifying questions so I don't know
what it's going to say um yeah just like
your name but you can change this you
can just give them a calendary link here
so they can book in and then you can be
selective with once they book you can
then cancel calls that's your choice um
but yeah you essentially want to test
this make sure it's running well then
you would want to go to your API Keys um
and then create a new secret um key and
then you basically want to copy that um
send it over to zapia um I think you
need the starter or the Premium zapia
plan um otherwise I don't think it's
going to work but once you do that um
you would then want to have the um that
link to high level basically um and then
once it links to high level you should
be good to go um but once again you
would test it into zapo and you can
always hardcode prompt it into zapo
yourself um using the same prompt you
use actually for the assistance
basically in in here if that makes sense
so um yeah that's why it is a lot more
advanced um to actually like do that um
but I don't know how on Earth I've got
to this point where it's like
um okay we're back but yeah basically
what I was saying is if in case you just
want this completely done for you you
don't want to um build this yourself and
you just want it in your own highle sub
account um so you also get yeah this one
so the Facebook one the Instagram one
SMS one as well as the um the chat gbt
one just DM me on Instagram um and I'll
basically tell you how you can get
access to it um but yeah besides that um
