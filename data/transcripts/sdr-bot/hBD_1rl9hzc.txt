# Category: n8n-automation

What is up guys? Welcome back to another
video. In this video, I'm going to show
you how to create a sales lead qualifier
agent by creating a simple workflow in
any gen. Let's get started. In any I
have created a workflow that I've
renamed to sales lead qualifier agent
agent. Yeah, we're going to start by
adding a trigger. I'm going to choose an
onform submission trigger over here.
Then I'll proceed to add the title,
description, and elements to form. I've
gone ahead and added the title,
description, and elements to our form.
So the form title is on the lines of
automation strategy intake form. The
description is on the lines of this
short form helps us understand your
business, your goals and what you want
to improve. The form elements first
field name is on the lines of what's
your full name. Element type of choosing
text and this field will be required.
The other field name is on the lines of
what's your email address element type
of choosing email and this field will
also be required. The other field name
is on the lens of what's your company
name element type using text and this
field will be required.
The other film is on the lines of what
best describes your business element
drop down and then we're adding these
options right here. So we adding agency,
commerce, coaching and consulting local
business as the options and this field
will also be required. The other field
name is on the lines of what problem are
you trying to solve right now. Element
type choosing text and this field will
be required. The other field name is on
the lines of what are you looking to
automate or improve? Element type
choosing text and this field will be
required. The other film is on the lines
of how agent is solving this for you.
Element choosing a drop down and adding
these options from here. So the options
are immediately in 30 days, one to 3
months or just exploring this field will
also be required. The other field name
is on the lines of what's your
approximate monthly budget for this
project. Element using a drop down and
adding these options over here. So the
options are under $500, 500 to,500,500
to 5,000 5,000 plus. I'm not sure yet
this field will be required. The other
field name is on the lines of who will
be involved in making the final decision
and I end up choosing a drop down and
adding these options over here. So the
decision maker can be prospect himself,
the team or could be researching. So
here I'll click on execute to fill out
our form.
This is our form. Here's the title of
the form and the description over here
with the elements to form over here. So
So we're going to fill out our form as a
lead. So we're going to start adding our
full name, email address, company name.
Can say we are running a coaching and
consulting business. The problem that
we're trying to solve is our team is
around repetitive task. So we like to
automate and onboarding, internal
reporting and proposal generation. Can
see immediately
here we have the budget
and uh I'll be the final decision maker.
So you click on submit submit our form.
You can see our form was submitted
successfully. We captured the data that
we just submitted via our form. So we
capture the full name, email address,
company name, the kind of business that
we're running, problem that we're trying
to solve, areas that we're looking to
automate, the agency budget, and the
decision maker. So here I'll pin this
data and use this data to set up our
workflow.
The next thing we're going to do here is
we can we can wait a few seconds. So I
search for the waiting order here. Here
we can wait let's say 5 seconds. I
rename this node to wait 5 seconds
and click on rename. Then here I'll
execute this node right here.
Can see that our node was executed
successfully. The next thing that we're
going to do here is we're going to set
the fields for the submission data.
So to do that I'll start with the set
fields not here and click on it.
Here we can set the fields for the data
that we submit perform. Let's start with
the full number here. Next, we can set
the field for the email address. The
next field I'm going to set is a company
name,
business description. This a business
type.
I'll can set the field for the problem.
I don't like to automate.
can rename this to timeline
the month budget and lastly decision
maker here and then I click on execute
set to set the fields over here can see
we successfully did that so I renamed
this note to set form submission fields
then here click on
the next thing that we're going to do
here is we're going to add a condition
to sure that we have the problems that
they're trying to solve and the area
they would like to automate fill in the
other the form. So to do that I'll
search for the if node to set the
conditions
and here can add the first condition
that the problem has to exist
and we can also add another condition
say that the areas they like to automate
have to also exist then I'll click on
execute right here see our output was in
the true branch but if it was in the
first branch and they hadn't filled in
the data
I'm going to do nothing they do nothing
here just to now proceed with our
buffalo. But since they filled in the
information, we're going to proceed with
our buffalo. So here can wait a few
seconds. So I'll search for the W here.
Can wait, let's say 3 seconds.
And then here, rename this to wait 3
seconds.
And then I click on rename here. I'll
execute this node.
Can see our node was executed
successfully. Now the next thing that
we're going to do here is we since we
have their data that they've submitted
via our form we're going to try and
qualify these leads. To do that we're
going to use an AI agent. So in AI I'll
click on AI agent. I'm going to choose
to define below to add our prompt and
our system message over here. The prompt
for our AI agent is on the lines of
you're a lead scoring and qualification
agent message is on the lines of your
job is to analyze an inbound lead based
on the information provided in the form
submission. You must call the lead,
classify it, and return the results
strictly in a valid JSON with no extra
text.
And here we adding couple of
instructions that we like the agent to
follow. So we're telling the agent you
must score the lead from 1 to 100 using
the scoring criteria below. Determine
the lead's fit level either high,
medium, or low. And then apply the lead
qualification logic to categorize the
lead as either qualified, natural or
disqualified. Then provide a short
explanation one to two sentences for the
score and never output anything outside
the JSON
structure for the scoring criteria.
We're telling the agent to score the
lead based on budget, agency and
timeline, clarity of the problem they
want to solve, intent level, authority,
business type, tools, business size, and
maturity. Then for the lead
qualification logic, we're telling the
agent to apply this exact logic. So if
the score is above 70, they are
qualified. If the score is between 40 to
69 they they need nurturing and if the
score is below 40 this lead is
disqualified for the fit level 80 to 100
is high 50 to 79 is medium 149 is low
and here when we like to output our
results in this JSON so we like to out
the score feed status and the reason why
we either qualified or disqualify this
lip and here we are mapping the data
that we set over here. So we add in the
leads name, email address, company name,
business type, problem that they're
looking to solve, areas they like to
automate, timeline, monthly budget, and
the decision maker over here. So here I
request specific output format. Then
I'll click on the output per here. I'll
click on the structured output per to
add our JSON example over here.
So this is the JSON example of our
output. And then here I'll drag this
node at the top over here. The next
thing that we're going to add is the
memory. I'm going to choose a simple
memory over here. I'm going to choose to
define below to add our key for the key
can choose to add any key over here to
add today's date as a key. Then I'll
drag this node at the top row here and
the last we're going to add is a chat
model and choose open chat model. You
don't need to create a new credential to
actually come to any so from your open
API. Add the API key right here and
click on save to create your credential.
Then close the window here and choose a
model and choose any of these models
over here. my mistake with GP GP 4.1
mini and drag this node at the top right
here. Since we filled in our form over
here, we can try and qualify this lead.
So I'll open our agent and then here
I'll click on execute step right here to
qualify our lead. You can see our node
was executed successfully. So here we
got the score feed status and the reason
why we score the lead. So the score was
85 feed high status is this lead was
qualified because the lead has a
substantial monthly budget. agent,
immediate timeline and clear automation
needs across multiple processes and is
the decision maker. The business type
fits well with automation services
making this lead high fit and highly
qualified. Our agent works perfectly. I
rename this agent to sales lead
qualifier agent and click on rename.
The next thing we're going to do here is
we're going to set the fields for the
results. So I search for the area fields
not over here to set the fields for the
score
the fit
status
and the reason over here
then here I click on execute step right
here to set the fields you can see our
node was executed successfully. So here
I rename this note to
set lead score fields and click on
rename right here. Yeah. The next thing
we're going to do here is we're going to
switch between the leads classification
using a switch node. So I'll search for
switch right here and click on it. Here
you can see if the status is qualified.
We're going to proceed with the
qualified route. can also add another
route over here and say that if the
status
is natural.
I want to proceed with the natural root.
Lastly, if the status is unqualified,
would like to proceed in the unqualified
route. I click on execute step right
here. Can see our output is in the
qualified route
over here. So now we can proceed and set
up our qualified route. So the first
thing that we're going to do here is we
can wait a few seconds. So I'll search
for the original here. Click on wait.
Can wait let's say 2 seconds
and then I'll click on execute several
here.
And then the next thing that we're going
to do here is we can send our lead in
notification email telling them that
they qualify to work with us. So to do
that here, search for Gmail
here and click on send a message note
over here. Yeah, you'll need to create
your credential to connect to account
2010. To do that, just click on sign in
with Google over here. Then on the new
window that pops up, choose the account
that you'd like to connect to and your
connection will be created. Since I
already done that, I'm going to close
this window over here to our email
subject line and message our email. I've
gone ahead and mapped the lead email
address that they fill in our form over
here. Then the subject line of this
email is on the lines of you're all set.
Let's build your automation strategy.
Email type and choose text. The message
of our email is on the lines of hi name.
Thanks for completing the automation
strategy in tech form. After reviewing
your responses, you're a strong fit for
the automation solution we provide.
Here's what happens next. We'll create a
personalized automation plan based on
the processes you you want to improve
and the systems you currently use.
You'll meet with a one of our
specialists to map out the fastest wins
and highest impacts automation for your

And the last thing that we're going to
do here is I'll click on add options and
click on append attribution. I'm going
to turn this to off. You can see I
renamed this now to qualified lead
message. So I'll click on execute
several here to send the lead the email
telling them that they're they're
qualified to work with us. We can also
send our team an email telling them that
we have a qualified lead. So we're going
to notify our team via Slack or email.
In our case, we're going to choose
email. So I'll search for Gmail here and
click on Gmail. Yeah, I'll click on send
a message not here. Now I've gone ahead
and added the email line of this email
is on the lines of new qualified lead
email type by choosing text. The message
of email is on the lines of a new lead
has been scored and qualified and
requires immediate followup. And here we
add in the name, email company and the
score of the lead. And here we adding
key notes of the lead. They are high
intent lead. They have a clear problem
statement, strong budget and a good fit
for automation. Reach out right away and
schedule a discovery call with this
lead. they have a higher chance of
closing. And here I'll click on add
options and click on appending
attribution and turn this to off. Then
I'll click on exec over here to send our
team this notification email here name
to qualify sales rep notification. Then
the last thing that we're going to do
here is we're going to add the lead that
is qualified
into a database in a table. So in a
table I've created a database that I've
named to sales ops commander center.
This B I've created three tables. So one
for the qualified leads, the other one
for the natural leads, the other one for
the unqualified leads. So for each table
we're going to add the leads name,
company name, email, business type,
problem that they're looking to solve,
areas I would like to automate, the
timeline, monthly budget,
the decision maker, score feed, status,
and the reason why this lead is either
qualified
needs to be nurtured or unqualified. So
now to add our list to our base over
here
in our workflow, I'll search for air
table
and click on your table here and here
and click on create a record node over
here. You'll need to create your
credential to connect your account to
anyone. So from your table, add your
access token over here. To get your
access token, click on your profile.
Then click on build a hub over here.
Click on create a token. Then give it a
name here. add all these scopes and then
choose a database that you like to
access the N10 over here and click on
create a token then on the new window
that pops up copy the token
come and paste it right here and click
on save to create your connection since
I already done that I'm going to close
it here and choose our base over here
this is our base our table is going to
be the qualified leads table and here
we're going to map values to our columns
in our spreadsheet with the data from
our workflow so we're going to start by
adding the lead name. So here we're
going to map their full name,
company name,
email address,
business type,
problem that they're looking to solve,
areas they would like to automate,
timeline,
monthly budget,
decision maker. also going to map the
also going to map the score
fit
status and the reason why this lead is
qualified over here. Then I'll click on
exec here to add our leads to our
database
in the qualified leads table can see we
added a new lead over here. So here's
their name, company name, the email
address, business type, problems that
they're looking to solve, areas they
would like to automate, timeline,
the monthly budget, decision maker,
their score fee, status, and the reason
why these leads are qualified over here.
So we qualify this lead and added their
their data to our base over here using
this workload that we created here in
any. So here I rename is now to create a
qualified lead record and then here I'll
click on rename. Then the last thing
that we're going to do here is we're
going to complete our workflow. So I'll
search for the do nothing here and click
on it.
Can drag this at the top at the bottom
over here. So now we can duplicate these
nodes over here
twice. One for the natural root and then
and the other for the unqualified route.
So I'll duplicate these nodes over here.
We can duplicate this node again. This
one's for the unqualified root. So this
will be for the natural root. Then this
will be for the unqualified root over
here. So now
I'll go ahead and update these nodes
with the right data. I've gone ahead and
updated the nodes for the natural root
and then qualified route. So here we're
waiting for seconds.
Then we are sending the lead an actual
email notification. Here we're mapping
their email address that they filled in
our form. And the subject line of this
email is on the lines of quick update on
your automation assessment. Message
email type using text and the message
bar is on the lines of hi name. Thanks
for taking the time to complete the
automation strategy in tech form. Basing
your answer. You're a potential fit but
it looks like you may need a bit more
clarity on your processes, priorities or
timeline before we jump into all
automation work. Here's what I
recommend. We'll share personalized
recommendations
report with the key automations that
will benefit your business. Once you're
ready, we can move into the full
strategy session and build everything

as John Peterson.
Then here, click on the attribution.
Turn this to off. So that is a natural
lead message that we're going to send
our lead. Then we're also going to send
notification to our sales rep with a sub
line which is on the lines of new
natural lead email using text and the
message board is on the lines of a new
lead has been scored as ner. They show
potential but are not ready for direct
sales yet. Mapping the name, email
company and the score. This including
some keos for the sales rep. We're
telling the sales rep that this lead
intent is medium. They need more clarity
and priorities or timing. We have
possible future project. Add this lead
to the natural pipeline and monitor
engagement. Follow up gently with
educational content and light checkins.
Yeah. Click on add options and click on
append attribution. We're going to turn
this to off
here. And lastly, we're adding the lead
to
your table. So, we're adding them to the
natural leads table. We adding the data
that that they submitted via form and
the score feed stats and the reason why
we qualify them as natural. Same with
the unqualified roots here. Here we're
starting by waiting a second. Then we
sending an unqualified lead message to
the lead. So here we're mapping the
email address of the field of form and
sub over here which is on the lines of
thank you for your submission. Email
type are choosing text. The message body
is on the lines of hi name. Thank you
for completing the automation strategy
in tech form at the moment. Based on
your responses, it looks like our
automation solutions may not be the best
fit for where your business is at right
now. This doesn't mean automation won't
be useful for you in the future that the
timing, budget, or current structure may
not support a high ROI automation
project at this stage. Here are two
options moving forward. You can revisit

budget grows and send you a free

here. Click on add options and click on
append attribution. Turn this to off.
This note also sending a sales rep
notification about the unqualified lead.
Here we're going to add the email to a
team. Subject line of the email is on
the lines of new disqualified lead.
Email type using text. the email and the
message bodies on the lines of a new
lead has been reviewed and marked as
disqualified based on current scoring.
And here we adding the name, email,
company and the score. We're also
including some key notes to the team.
We're telling the team that the intent
is low or unclear needs, insufficient
budget or timing is not aligned. Not a
fee for current information services.
The action we're telling the team
immediate sales action needed. Keep on
record for future reassessment. If they
re-engage or show growth signals, then
here add options and click on abandon
attribution. Then I turn these two off.
And lastly, we're going to add the lead
to the unqualified lead table in your
table.
So here we're going to add them to the
unqualified leads table and uh add their
data over here. So we're going to add
the form submission data, the score,
feed status, and the reason why they are
unqualified their table. Then we're
going to complete our workflow over
here.
So our workflow works perfectly. So here
we are triggering our workflow after a
list submits our form with your data.
Then we're waiting a few seconds then we
are setting the form submission data
using this not here. If they submitted
their problem and the would like to
automate then proceeding and qualifying
this lead using this AI agent over here
and then
we're setting the lead cause over here
using this node. Then you're switching
between qualified natural and
unqualified categories.
right here. So if the lead is qualified
by proceeding and sending them a
qualified lead message and we're also
sending a sales rep a notification about
the qualified lead then we adding the
lead in your table. If the lead has been
classified as not we're sending them a
not lead message using this node. We're
also sending a sales rep notification
about the lead and then we're proceeding
toward the lead to to your table. Then
the lead is unqualified. We're waiting a
few seconds then sending the lead
an unqualified lead message. We're also
sending our team a notification
notifying them of the lead and we adding
the lead in your table using this node
over here. So we can go ahead and try
and test our workflow to see how it
works. Now since I had already tested
the qualified route and we added a lead
on the qualified leads table in your
table you can try testing the not and
the unqualified route to test our
workflow here. Alan pin this data and
click on execute workflow to fill out
our form.
We're going to start by filling in
our full name and the email address. So
going to fill in the company name
for here can say we're running an agency
problem I would like to solve is that
the leads are slipping through the crocs
because we do not have an organized
follow-up system. So we like to automate
late followup client communication and
scheduling process here can say we like
to solve these in the next one 3 months
budget you can see under 500
shape you can see it's me and here click
on submit you can see for submitted over
You can see that our workflow was
executed successfully. So we trigger
this node
after we filled in our form with this
data over here. So here we capture the
full name, email address, company name,
business type, problem that we're
looking to solve, areas we like to
automate, timeline, budget, and the
decision maker. Then then here we set
the fields for the form submission data.
And you can see here they met our
condition. Then we proceeded to qualify
the lead using this AI agent over here.
So now when I open this order, you can
see we get them a score of 55. The feed
can say media, it's medium. The status
is natural because the lead shows clear
intent and has a specific problem with a
1 to 3 months timeline which is
positive. However, the monthly budget is
under 500 which limits potential
engagement and the lead is a single
decision maker with a small agency
giving a media feed overall. So because
they got a score of 55 they were
classified as not where we proceeded to
send them the lead na message. We also
sent our sales rep a notification
notifying them of the lead. Then we then
we added the lead to natural leads table
in a table. Then we completed our
workflow over here.
Now when I open our base and click on
the natural leads table
create a new record right here. So we
added the list name, company name, the
email address, business type, problems
they're looking to solve, areas we like
to automate, the timeline,
the timeline, monthly budget, decision
maker, score, fees, status, and the
reason why they were qualified
as nacho over here. When they open our
inbox, here is the email that we're
sending to telling them hi name. Thanks
for taking the time to complete this
form. bas on your answers, your
potential,
there are potential fee, but it looks
like you may need a bit more clarity on
your processes, priorities, and timing.
And here we're giving them some
recommendations
over here.
And then we're going to help them
whenever the timing makes sense over
here. So, we're sending them this
notification email over here. They're
also sending our team this email
notification. We were telling the team,
a new lead has been scored as nacho.
They're potential, but I'm not ready for
direct sales yet. Here's the
information. And here's the key notes
over here. Return them follow up gently
with educational content and light shins
over here. So here we
classify the leader field in our form
over here using this AI agent and send
them these email notification
and added them to to the natural leads
table in our base using this workflow
that we created here in any we can try
testing the unqualified route. To test
it, I'll click on execute workflow right
here. Form, we're going to start by
filling in our full name, mail address,
and the company name
can say local business problem. You can
say I want to learn automation.
We're looking to automate not yet. Just
exploring agency. You can say we just
exploring options. Monthly budget can
say not sure yet. The decision maker is
just me. I click on submit. Submit form.
can see our farm was submitted
successfully.
Here we can see that our workflow was
executed successfully. So to get our
workflow
after we submitted our data over here
the form. So we capture the full name,
mail address, company name, business
type, problem they're looking to solve,
areas they're looking to automate,
timeline, budget and the decision maker.
Then we set the phone fields over here
using this node. Then here you can see
the meta condition. Then we proceeded to
qualify this lead using this AI agent.
Can see here
we give them a score of 25. Feed is low
such as they were disqualified because
this lead is in the early explor
exploration stage without defined
business processes, budget or urgency
indicating low readiness and feed for
automation services.
Then here we switch them to the
unqualified
rout where we send them the unqualified
lead message. We also notify the team of
the unqualified lead. Then we proceeded
to add the lead in the unqualified leads
table in your table. Then we completed
our workflow over here in our base. When
I when I open the unqualified leads
table, we added a new leads record here.
So we added the lead name, company name,
the email address, business type,
problem they're looking to solve, areas
we like to automate, timeline, monthly
budget,
decision maker, the score, feed, status,
and the reason why they were
disqualified.
over here. We also sent them these email
notification right here. Here's the
subject line of the email and the body
of the email over here. So, we're
telling them at the moment based on your
response, looks like our automation
solutions may not be the best fit for
where your business is at right now. And
then here we're giving them two options
moving forward over here to send them a
guide using this email over here. We
also notify the name of the disqualified
lead lead using this email over here
with the subject line and this email
body. where we including the lead data
and some key nodes over here. We
disqualify this lead sent this email
notification right here using this
workflow that we created right here in
any gen. So our workflow works
perfectly. Thank you for watching. Now
if you'd like me to create this workflow
for you or a workflow similar to this
one, just click the first link in the
description to schedule a call with me.
On the call, we'll discuss into details
about the workflow that you'd like me to
create for you and then I'll proceed to
create the workflow for you. But if you
enjoy this video and you have an AI
agent or a workflow in mind that you'd
like me to create using any 10, just
comment it down below in the comment
section. I read all the comments and if
I land on your comment and I find it
intriguing, I'll come back on a future
video showing you how to create the
entire workflow or AI agent from scratch
using an agent. But for now, thank you
for watching and I'll see you in the
next video. Goodbye.
