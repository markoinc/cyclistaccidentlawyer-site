AI voice callers are a rapidly growing
technology that can handle inbound and
outbound calling fully autonomously for
your business this system uses
artificial intelligence to generate a
response to a caller's question and then
uses AI to generate a realistic sounding
voice that then repeats the response
back to the caller I know it sounds
crazy but I encourage you to watch this
video to get a true understanding on how
this works rather than waiting months
for sales teams to call lead lists AI
callers can do this in minutes rather
than making leads wait for our calls we
can call and qualify them with this in
minutes if you are a business that is
making calls every single day then this
is something you need to pay attention
to here is a quick demo of how it sounds
hey welcome to inflate what can I help
you with my name is Brendon I'd like to
book a call on Monday for 2 p.m. on a
sec your call on Monday at 2 p.m. has
been booked businesses today are
spending thousands to tens of thousands
to hundreds of thousands of dollars on
tele marketing tele marketing is simply
the direct marketing of goods or
services true potential customers over
the phone not only is it expensive to
hire teams of people to make these calls
it also takes a lot of time to dial all
these numbers one by one now imagine if
we could fully automate these calls with
realistic sounding quick to respond AI
voice callers that are indistinguishable
from real people my name is Brendan and
I run inflate AI where my team and I
help businesses integrate the latest AI
Solutions I'm from Melbourne Australia
and dived into the AI space with the
release of chat GPT identifying the
significant imp impact that it would
have on businesses this video is backed
up not only by me but my partners at
inflate Ai and our clients who have
experienced genuine results from these
systems that I will go through in this
video I'm going to go in depth into the
world of AI voice callers and break down
everything you need to know taking you
from a complete beginner with no
experience to being an expert in AI
voice callers if you feel pressured
because you don't understand how these
systems work and I'm not sure how it
could help your business this video is
for you to get a real understanding of
how this is being used used today to get
you up to speed with everybody else I'm
first going to cover the opportunity at
large there are many different use cases
and industries for AI callers that I've
had come through my own agency so
hopefully these use cases and clear
advantages provided for businesses will
help you think about how this could be
used in your own business I'm then going
to cover key Concepts these key Concepts
will quickly get you up to speed with
all of the jargon software AI Basics
essentially everything you need to know
to start building your first caller I'll
then go in depth into the two main
platforms that we use within my agency
to develop these systems vapy and
make.com I'll go through exactly what
these platforms are during the key
Concepts I'll then move on to prompt
engineering which is one of the most
critical processes in building and
instructing these systems to work as
best as possible you'll once again learn
exactly what prompting and prompt
engineering is in the key Concepts I'll
then go through a practical task
building out an outbound C calling
system this will take a list of leads
and start calling them and collecting
data back such as if the believe was
interested in purchasing our services or
not I'll also go through how to build an
inbound lead qualification caller step
by step you'll also have completely free
access to everything in this video
including all the templates and prompts
within my free resource Hub Link in the
description this also includes 20 other
chatbot and automation related templates
as well this may seem like a lot to take
in but I've designed this tutorial to be
super easy to follow along with
especially for beginners so I'm going to
start off by going over the opportunity
so to get started I'm just going to take
a little bit of a step back back and go
through a bit about what the use case
here is for these systems so very simply
businesses send and receive phone calls
every single day and most commonly these
are sales calls so a sales call is a
conversation between a salesperson and a
prospect about the purchase of a product
or service now the purpose of this call
is to understand if that person is
actually interested in the product or
service the business offers and to then
qualify them for the next steps in their
sales process so this could be booking
them into an appointment or just having
someone else call them at another time
this is really just any step that will
help the lead make a more informed
purchase so what does this involve well
option one could be an in-house
salesperson so an in-house salesperson
is someone that's being paid a salary I
just quickly Googled and the average
base salary for a salesperson is around
55,000 USD and that's not including
performance fees so performance fees are
sort of an incentive to continue to sell
so if they make a sale they get a
percentage of that sell and that's their
performance fee so the salesperson would
actually require training as well on the
business and the exact products and
services so they can actually handle any
customer objections and actually provide
value to the customers so this is just
going to cost more time and money this
team will also then need access to some
sort of CRM so customer relationship
management software to actually track
which leads were interested and which
were not and then this is just going to
consume more of the Sal seams time which
is taking time away from calling and
therefore reducing efficiency now
alternatively businesses may decide to
hire an external sales team also known
as Outsourcing so this could be sort of
a company that provides sales services
that essentially just lends you their
existing team or you go ahead and just
hire some sort of freelance salesperson
who operates remotely now currently
hiring some sort of Outsource sales team
from the US can be pretty expensive 5 to
six figures per month plus performance
fees depending on obviously the supplier
of that team whereas hiring a team from
countries like the Philippines where
labor is actually cheaper it's quite
common for outsourcing callers and sales
teams now this can be significantly
cheaper at around four figures per month
and depending on the agreement you may
not have to pay performance fees or at
least it will be significantly less than
the performance fees of the US team now
these sales team will typically do two
types of calls and they are the inbound
calls and outbound calls so inbound is
when a lead submits a form on a website
with their phone number they'll then
receive a call from a salesperson and
this is an inbound lead call so they're
inbound because they've contacted into
the business and then they're getting a
call few minutes later or maybe a few
hours later depending on you know what
their structure is and so this is done
to sort of handle any objections so
especially for higher ticket items being
able to offer insights into the products
and services will increase the chances
of actually selling rather than losing
them when they see the price PR on the
website and this is a very common sales
strategy so typically if you go on a
website and they don't have the prices
directly on that product specifically
and it just says to contact them or call
them this is exactly why they want to
handle any objections and make sure they
can actually close that sale because
it's worth it to them to make that call
now for outbound when the business finds
a sort of lead list online or just has a
lead list and then it goes ahead and
calls them and really just markets their
products and services this is cold
outbound calling so the lead knows
nothing about their services and this is
just a very common way for businesses to
obtain new clients and ideally the
business has a good data set of leads
that are sort of relatively qualified so
they are actually interested in those
Services uh and we'll call them so let's
just quickly compare those different
methods so we've got the in-house sales
team some of the benefits are that they
are motivated to sell because they're in
the business there's that good sort of
corporate culture because they're within
the business they're alongside other
people and they're motivated to work
with them there's likely going to be a
higher direct performance earning so the
more sales they make the more money they
make and therefore there's motivation
there they're easier to monor if they're
in house
it's very easy to monitor if they're
sitting right next to you or they're
just in the office they're also going to
be properly trained within the business
so obviously if they're working
alongside other people in the same
business and they've been directly
trained by the managers or something
similar they're obviously going to have
much more experience than something like
an external team there's also going to
be a much better experience for the
leads because of their language their
accent their knowledge so obviously
they're not you know coming from
overseas if they're in house they're
from the US they've got the language
they can speak fluently if you're
calling with your native accent it's a
bit more relatable to the caller they've
obviously got more knowledge on the
products and services because they've
been properly trained and then the leads
are going to have a better experience
because they can get more help and they
can get a better understanding of what
they're buying so the downside of the
in-house sales team is that it is
expensive so the wages involved like I
said with that sort of average 55,000
base salary not including performance
fees it's very expensive to get someone
in house uh working full-time to do
those sales it's going to be time
consuming to actually onboard them into
the business so they're going to have to
train them on everything the services
and whatnot and get them up to speed
it's going to be time Jing to actually
run the sort of campaigns so it's going
to take weeks to months to them to
obviously call people especially if
there's only one of them that's going to
be a very big cost cuz you're going to
need more expensive stuff if you
actually want to scale that system
there's also the chance for human error
so if they miss a lead that comes
through or calls them back uh especially
if you're getting hundreds to thousands
of leads per day uh there's just going
to be lost opportunity there some of the
benefits of the Outsource sales team is
that it's cheap if it's overseas you're
accessing that cheaper Labor uh it's
going to be a better decision to make
and it's going to be relatively easy to
on board so these teams that you hire
that are outsourced they're probably
going to have processes in place to set
up as quickly as possible so for you
it's probably going to be quite easy but
obviously in contrast to that they're
going to be quite hard to monitor if
they're overseas and they're not exactly
the most fluent in English it's going to
be quite hard to communicate with and
ensure that you're getting exactly what
you need across they're not really going
to be motivated to sell cuz you have no
control over that incentive it's
possible that they're giving them an
incentive it's likely not going to be as
much as your us-based sales team they're
likely to be poorly trained obviously
because it's hard to monitor it's really
hard to tell if these people have been
given all of the required documents and
sort of knowledge and have actually put
in the time to learn about the business
so it's going to be pretty hard to
actually know if they're going to be
well trained it's also probably going to
be a much worse experience for the leads
especially if they don't have that sort
of native accent to the country they're
meant to be calling from the language
they're not going to be fluent in
English or whatever language you want
them to be speaking from uh and
obviously the knowledge if they're
poorly trained if they're not as
motivated to actually understand
everything their knowledge is not going
to be that great and they might not be
able to answer all of your leads
questions now comparing this to AI phone
callers a phone callers are cheap so
they're probably similar in price to the
Outsource overseas team definitely much
cheaper than the in-house us team it's
easy to monitor this system because you
got access to all of the data at all
times you'll have access to everything
that's going on with all of the calls
that being made the transcripts the call
recordings everything you can get access
to these phone callers are going to be
motivated to sell they're not going to
change from when we set them up so we
can just set them up to motivated and
they're going to stay like that they're
going to be highly trained as well so
we're going to give it all the knowledge
about the business and it can pull any
bit of information that it needs and
it's probably going to be more informed
than you on the business I've noted that
it's going to be a decent experience for
leads so I'm not saying it's going to be
the best experience ever I'm also not
saying that it's going to be a bad
experience I'm just saying that the
experience compared to something like
the international Outsource team that
probably has a different accent it's
definitely going to be better than that
but I can't guarantee that it's going to
be as good as an in-house us team
salesperson just because of the nature
of the fact that it is still AI whilst
it does sound super realistic obviously
sometimes the responses do sound a bit
robotic and that's because it well it is
a robot so that's just the case but for
the most part we should still meet our
sort of call objectives whether that's
qualifying them for our services or
booking appointments we should be able
to meet that sort of call objective
through this caller we can also have
data immediately sent into the CRM
system so we can just have all of the
call information and call outcomes
directly sent into the CRM system
without any need to manually type in
anything this system is also very quick
so we can actually send thousands of
calls within minutes now we probably
wouldn't send thousands of calls in
minutes we do this in more of a sort of
batch approach so we actually analyze
the results from the first set of leads
then we actually measure the results and
make the appropriate adjustments and
then once we've actually ran an
extensive testing period and we're
actually confident in how it performs
then we'll move into sort of a more bulk
process I will cover testing and data
analysis later in the video so I've gone
ahead and created a table with the three
different methods here just to really
visualize the benefits of each so we can
see here obviously see the AI callers
are coming in and pretty much crushing
in all of the areas except for the lead
experience where I've said it's decent
it's definitely not as bad as the
outsourc team uh but it's probably not
as good as the in-house team but then
obviously we need to weigh up all the
other elements one being cost obviously
is cheap in-house is very expensive and
the time it's quick to do the a calls uh
it's very slow to do the inhouse team so
when we weigh up all these factors the
lead experience ultimately at being
decent is something that is probably
justifiable so hopefully that sounds
good I'm now going to go through how
Industries are actually using this so
one very specific use case is real
estate so we've had quite a few real
estate agents come through our agency
and on through this Channel and so real
estate agents have sort of a list of
leads that could be homeowners and they
will usually call them to see if there's
actually a potential that they may want
to actually sell their property and so
if so they'll actually follow up with
them with further information and then
hopefully make a commission on actually
selling their home now the solution to
this could be an outbound caller that
would then call all of these leads
automatically
just ask a few qualifying questions
capture that data and then send that
into a CRM system and then that will be
done within minutes another industry is
e-commerce so around 70% of online
customers actually abandon their carts
and this just means they've added a
product to the cart that then left the
website and they haven't purchased now
currently stores will actually send text
messages and emails to get them to
purchase again and if this is not
successful we can then Implement uh an
AI caller to follow up with them and
provide a 24-hour discount code or just
some other benefit and this would just
help to reduce the 70% of lost sales so
this could be simply a call that just
says hey we saw you were interested in
this product here's a 24-hour discount
code another industry is car dealerships
so they receive thousands of calls per
month uh and an inbound phone number
that provides car recommendations and
information based off of the car
inventory would help to close more sales
and just save a lot of time and money
compared to the existing team home
services so pool Ms pressure washing
lawn mwing Etc all of these service
based business businesses get hundreds
of calls per day and are spending large
amounts of money to actually capture
these leads and convert them into sales
so by implementing a properly built AI
voice system we can then immediately
reduce the current cost of taking those
calls we will then start to see an
immediate impact on the time it actually
takes to respond to these leads and this
will just mean more leads converting and
sales increasing very quickly so
hopefully you can now recognize the
significant advantage that AI phone
callers have over existing sales
processes I'm now going to go through
some of the key fundamental concepts so
four key Concepts that I'm going to go
through are large language models
prompting functions and software so
don't get overwhelmed by this it's
really quite simple and I'm going to go
through each of these step by step so a
large language model is a computational
model notable for its ability to achieve
general purpose language generation so
very simply the large language model is
just a smart brain that has been trained
on lots of data and is able to generate
answers to questions now there are many
different LMS created by different
companies so the creator of chat gbt is
open Ai and they created the GPT models
for example GB3 and A2 or gbd4 So Meta
or Facebook created a model called llama
and Google created a model called Gemini
so there are many large language models
out there but for the purpose of this
video I'll be using the GPT models uh so
these are just the most popular and
capable models for this purpose as of
today prompting so an AI prompt is any
form of text question information or
coding that communicates to AI what
response you're looking for so this is
how we actually communicate to the large
language model so this llm being the
brain of our voice assistant so our
voice assistant will actually act
according to our prompt prompt
engineering so prompt engineering is the
process of actually structuring an
instruction that can then be interpreted
and understood by a generative AI model
so there is a structure and process that
must be followed to ensure you're
effectively communicating with the AI so
instance we've got sort of good prompts
and bad prompts now good prompts are
sort of clear prompts that concise they
give relevant context they're driven by
purpose so it's well structured it's
very clear exactly what we're looking
for and then move up the bad prompts and
these bad prompts are ambiguous they
lack crucial details they use unclear
language and they're probably going to
be misleading now I will dive deeper
into prompt engineering specifically for
AI phone callers later in the video but
this is what will make or break your
voice assistant so this is what we're
actually going to be testing and
improving so heavily during our analysis
for our clients now for function calls
when answering any sort of questions the
model can choose to delicate certain
data processing tasks very simply we can
actually set up functions that
essentially trigger what automations in
the background of our calls so for
example if we wanted to save a lead's
name and address into our CRM system we
could create a function that then just
looks for their name and address during
the call once it's found those values it
just sends them into our CRM using an
API call which I'll just cover in the
second the way this function works is
that it's actually prompted to
understand what it's looking for for
example we could say please run this
function when you have captured the name
and address now I will cover this
further during the live build where I
set up multiple functions for different
purposes API requests so API request
stands for application program interface
and an API call or API request is just a
message that's sent to a server asking
an API to provide a service or
information so for example the weather
bureau's software system contains daily
weather data the weather app on your
phone would then talk to this system via
an API and that's how it shows you that
daily weather update on your phone so
when we want to send our data from the
voice caller to our CRM system we will
then use an API request to send this
data fundamentally there are two main
API request types a post request and a
get request simply put a post request
posts data off to another application to
be used and a get request asks to
receive certain data back from an
application now I will set up both of
these API requests with the functions
during my live builds onto software so
vy. this is the platform that we use to
build AI phone callers so it enables us
to actually change the llm models prompt
the assistants and then change the voice
sound Etc now we'll extensively cover
this platform later in the video uh and
ultimately this is the Key software that
we're going to be using for the creation
of this system so make.com this is an
automations platform that we will use
with our functions if you are familiar
with zpr this platform is pretty similar
so we're able to make an API quest to
make with some data from the phone call
and then have it easily sent into any
CRM system or database of our choice so
you can kind of think of it as a central
hub for connecting thousands of
different applications to easily talk to
each other 11 Labs so this is a platform
that we will use to get realistic
sounding voices bappy enables us to
actually connect different voice
platforms 11 Labs is one of them so 11
Labs is also known for being one of the
best in realistic sounding voices it
also has quite a large public voice
Library as well as the ability to
actually clone your own voice so
hopefully you now understand the
significant benefit these systems can
actually provide for businesses and you
should also have an understanding of the
fundamental pieces that these systems
are built on all right so jumping
straight into it I'm going to go through
VAP and I'm going to go through make.com
as like I said these are going to be the
two main platforms that we use within
our agency and that we pretty much
recommend to use to build these systems
so this is the vapy platform vapy like I
said is used to build our voice systems
so vapy like I said is used to build our
main voice systems so this is going to
allow us to prompt uh to provide prompts
and then to instruct our assistants to
connect our voice platforms essentially
everything is going to be connected to
this system um and then everything can
be also managed within this as well so
this page that you'll land on once
signing up for an account it is
completely free to sign up for an
account you just have to pay for the
cost per minute so when we run these
systems there is a cost per minute if
you haven't yet signed up for vapy I'd
greatly appreciate it if you'd go ahead
and sign up using my affiliate Link in
the description so the page that we're
on right now is sort of our assistance
uh menu so we've got a whole host of
assistants here it is blocked out just
cuz I have a few client Builds on here
but this is essentially just going to be
a list of the assistants that we've
created on vapy now each assistant is a
different call so each assistant is
given one prompt and that prompt forms
who that caller is how it talks what it
talks about how it responds all of that
is contained within a single assistant
so before I dive into all of these sort
of features uh contained within the
assistance functions I'll just go down
to phone numbers so so in vapy we're
able to import from twio or Vonage I'm
using twilio specifically for this uh so
I'll show you how to generate a twilio
number so on twilio it's actually really
easy to create a phone number just sign
up for a twilio account and you will
actually automatically get given a Us
phone number to use so if you just want
to use the US phone number for now for
testing you can go ahead sign up for an
account you're going to land on a sort
of main menu page like this and then
you're going to see at the bottom left
your account Sid authentication token
it's also going to view you the phone
number uh that's registered to your
account going back to vapy we can just
hit import and then it's just going to
ask us for that information just give it
your twio phone number that it provided
you with twio account Sid T
authentication token and then we can
just give it a label so this is just
anything we're just naming what it's
called um and we can just fill in those
bits of data click import and then from
that you're going to be able to import
your too number now if you're not
located within the us or you want to buy
a separate number or a different number
you can also go ahead and buy numbers uh
through twio or you can buy a number
through vapy itself now unfortunately
vapy only provides US and Canada forone
numbers at the moment but obviously if
you are in the US and Canada this is a
pretty easy choice to make just use this
and you can just pay $2
uh and you'll be a to get your phone
number directly from VY without having
to deal with tulo once you've gone ahead
and imported your phone number there's
going to be two options here called
inbound and outbound now inbound and
outbound is just simply how we want to
send our calls so we can set up this
phone number to be the inbound assistant
uh for a particular assistant so I can
click through my list of assistants and
just choose any of the ones that we
created previously on the page I was
just looking at and we can assign that
to a phone number so if I wanted to
assign this phone number to particular
assistant anytime anybody calls that
phone number that assistant is going to
pick up uh from that call now for the
outbound section here what we can do is
essentially just set a phone number that
we want to send a call to we can select
the assistant that we want to be sending
off uh and that's all going to be with
under the phone number that we're on so
this phone numbers tab is everything to
do with sending and receiving calls uh
and dealing with all that number
information just below phone numbers is
a documents tab so this documents tab is
for uploading any knowledge based docum
now I will come back to this in just a
minute cuz this is related more to the
assistance uh than more of a main
function but ultimately we upload
documents to be able to assign them to
assistants and this gives our assistants
more knowledge so we can upload a PDF
file of information on the business we
can assign that to an assistant that is
meant to help people understand the
business uh and then obviously without
adding everything into the assistant so
this tab is to centrally store all of
our documents maybe we want to use one
document on multiple assistants and so
if we have a documents folder here we
can essentially assign any document to
any assistant by uploading them right
here now below this we have the voice
library and the voice library is a a
huge list of all of the voices uh that
are assigned to a particular voice
provider so in this case I've got 11
Labs selected as a voice provider and
it's gone ahead and listed all of the 11
Labs voices that I've got on my account
or some of these sort of main 11 Labs
voices that are provided so it says here
total 56 voices so the 's a lot of
flexibility around the different types
of voices that we may want to choose now
I'm from Australia so I wouldn't
necessarily want a US accent for my
Australian clients so I can go ahead and
I just select Australian for the accent
and now I've got a list of Australians
that I can use to make a bit more of a
realistic sounding system for the
Australian clients now additionally like
I mentioned previously 11 Labs allows us
to clone our own voices and so if we
connect our 11 Labs account we can now
get access to our own voice clones so
this right here is my voice clone within
vapy that I can simply assign to any
assistant I'd like and it can start to
speak just like me so I can just quickly
test how that actually sounds so you can
see if it sounds any good I allow my
intuition to lead my path so this is a
pretty cool feature if we want to clone
any of our clients voices to make it
that little bit extra realistic or you
want to trick your friends clone your
voice you can just send them a call with
your voice now in order to actually
connect your 11 labs to vapy we do just
have to come down to provider apis down
here and this is where it proves
provides us with all of the different
platforms that can connect to vapy so
there are a lot of platforms that we can
connect to vapy and this is one of the
things that I really like about vapy is
that it is completely open there's no
restrictions as to what you can use and
what you can't they've added in a heap
of options that we can come through and
add in our API keys for and it will just
connect directly to that and we can
start using it from vapy so in this
instance I've gone ahead and connected
11 Labs so all I've done is gone to 11
Labs they've even got a button here to
take you there go to your 11 Labs find
the API key through the settings or for
whatever platform you want to use they
should have a pretty easy way to get an
API key you just copy that key paste it
in here uh and then it's automatically
connected and then if I go back to my
voice Library it's going to autop
populate all of the 11 lab Dev voices
from my library into vapy I've also done
the same for open AI so when we actually
generating the responses for our voice
assistance I've gone ahead and uploaded
my own API key to pay for that through
open AI however if you prefer you can go
ahead and actually not upload any Keys
yourself uh and you can just have it
build directly through vappy through
that cost per minute it'll just build
through vappy so going back up to call
logs this is where all of the calls are
actually stored and saved so every call
we make whether it's inbound or outbound
all get stored within this one page and
this is really convenient because now we
can get access to the entire call
recording call summaries call logs call
transcripts a lot of data on what's
going on through these calls so if we
want to start sending out a whole host
of calls uh everything is is tracked
through here jumping down to
organization this is some sort of
backend details you won't necessarily
need this but we have here are API keys
and so I actually use this later in the
video when I'm building out some of the
assistants but these API Keys allow us
to talk to vapy Via apis so we can
actually essentially send calls uh in an
automated fashion so when I build the
call calling machine uh what we're able
to do is send a request to the vapy API
and then what we're doing is triggering
a call for every new lead in our lead
list and so that's one of the call
calling systems that we're going to need
these keys for so I'll show you how to
use this later in the video but this is
where you'll find it jumping down to
billing this is all of the sort of cost
per minute uh costs so every time we
make a call it does cost money to
actually run that call especially if it
goes for a long time as there is a cost
per minute associated with every call so
what it will do is it will track
essentially all of the calls that occur
it's going to rack up those costs and
then you'll essentially just be build
directly to the payment method that you
added to vappy and you can set up a
monthly usage limit so if you want to
strictly limit your system to not hit
over a budget if you set that monthly
usage limit uh and then it reaches that
limit essentially The Voice Assistant
will just stop calling they just won't
work and you won't be build from there
so that is pretty much it for the leth
hand side of the vapy menu options if we
go up to the top right here we have an
Ask AI for help and this is a really
cool uh function that allows us to sort
of ask like a chatbot anything about
vapy so if we wanted a question about
how much does it cost uh we can actually
send this off to a pretty cool AI uh
that's going to go through a bunch of
different short FAQ stuff so if you're
ever confused about something you need
help with something uh we can just talk
directly to this um and then we're going
to be able to get some support through
their documents or we can actually ask
their AI chat directly so I've just
asked the vapy AI how much does it
actually cost uh and you can see here
the cost depends on several different
factors calls duration providers Etc so
that's pretty accurate um VAP itself
charges a flat rate of 5 cents so that's
a good thing to knowe uh so instead of
Vy obviously charging us a monthly
subscription or something like that all
they do is charge 5 cents per minute for
calls and so with all of the providers
as well if we go back to our provider
apis when we upload this it doesn't
upsell or upch charge on any of this so
we upload our API Keys it directly
charges to those accounts at the sort of
wholesale cost uh if you will we're
paying the direct cost to those
platforms and that's another really good
benefit of vapy is that it's
significantly cheaper because of that
all right so now I'm going to jump into
the actual specific of the assistant
settings on vapy so this initial page
here just this bit here is our all of
the assistant settings required to build
our assistant one good thing about vapy
is we can actually test it within the
browser so if we hit talk with in this
case John's Pizza this is a very example
system that I built we can just talk
with it over the web uh it will just
turn on our mic we can talk back and
forth with it and test if it works
through this but the main area of this
that you're going to be using is this
bottom section here which contains the
model transcriber voice functions and
advanced settings so now I'm going to go
through all of the model settings and
this is everything to do with prompting
and our large language model so to get
started we've got a first message now
the first message is pretty much exactly
what it says it's the first thing that
it says when you call the assistant so
in this case I've said hey welcome to
John's Pizza what can I get you today so
if we were calling up a pizza place this
would be the first message that it reads
out and we can set that to be sort of a
static value this won't change it'll
just read this word for word then below
this we've got the system prompt and the
system prompt is our main prompt the set
of instructions that we're going to give
to the AI to read through and then build
it sort of personality from now I will
go through prompting and everything you
need to know about prompting later in
the video but just so you know this is
exactly where the prompt is going to go
and all it is is you naturally typing
into this box here to talk to it to tell
it how it works or how it should respond
to certain questions that's all typed
naturally in here and the AI is able to
read this it is able to follow that and
and then craft its sort of Personality
uh and structure from so off to the
right here we've got our large language
model settings firstly we have the
provider so in this case I'm using open
AI so open AI was the creator of chat
GPT it's one of the biggest uh you know
models out there it's one of the most
used models out there and it's one of
the best performing models so I'm using
open AI there is a whole host of other
models that you can choose as well but
for this instance just going to be
choosing open AI for now just below this
we've got our model now the model I've
chosen GB3 and A2 turbo but for the open
AI we've got two sort of different model
choices one being gbd3 and A2 one being
gbd4 now there are two different use
cases for these two different models
gbd3 and A2 is a much quicker uh much
faster responding system however its
responses aren't as sophisticated as
something like gbd4 gb4 is quite a bit
slower in responding gbt 4 is much
slower in responding but it thinks
through its answers a bit more and can
respond more accurately and follow the
prompt a bit better so if we have a Sal
script gbd4 will'll be able to interpret
that a bit better and follow through
with the answers that you're probably
more looking for but obviously with a
voice assistant where you want sort of
quick responses something like GB3 and a
half will provide that sort of extra
level of realism in this case I'm just
going to choose GB3 and A2 but in some
cases if you've got a really long
complex prompt once again going to go
through this further in the video but
I'm just going to choose GB3 and a half
for now and just below this we've got
our knowledge base so our knowledge base
once again is where we upload files to
and then we can assign certain files to
particular assistants so in this case we
can now just select any of the documents
that we've uploaded in the document
section to a particular assistant so if
we wanted to upload in this case the
menu to our pizza restaurant we could do
that here simply upload the file attach
the file and then we can just prompt the
assistant to then reference that
information so we could say I answer
this using the knowledge based
information and then it's going to start
to pull info from the knowledge base now
just below this we've got temperature
now temperature is the randomness of the
output so where we're able to control
how random we want the outputs to be so
if we want it to be really strict and
follow our prompt precisely uh we can
bring this temperature all the way down
to something like 0.1 where its response
must follow the prompt exactly and
output exactly what we're looking for
now if we wanted a bit more of a
creative response we could bump this
temperature all the way up to something
like two but there are sort of benefits
and disadvantages of both ends now below
this we've got Max tokens this is
essentially the maximum amount that the
AI can sort of respond with at once so
depending on the type of assistant that
you're building if you wanted to Output
a lot of information at once you can
bump this Max tokens up to a much higher
figure and then it can output more words
at once so essentially I like to keep
this very low CU I don't like the bot to
sort of go on a huge conversation saying
lots of things CU people on the phone
aren't going to really like that I like
to keep it nice short concise so the way
if we bump this number down to a very
short amount maybe put this at 100 the
responses are just going to be shorter
respons is they're going to be more
concise and I typically find for voice
assistant specifically a lower token
amount is better just because we don't
want it to obviously generate an entire
paragraph or an entire book of
information and then you're on the phone
with it and it's reading it for about 10
minutes you obviously don't want that to
happen so just making sure that if we
reduce the tokens we're essentially
forcing it to be concise and sure in its
answers now below this we've got a
function that says detect speech emotion
and this is actually able to detect the
emotion of the person talking to the
assistant so if some guy starts yelling
at the assistant ideally that this will
actually pick it up and it's able to uh
add that into the prompt here so
obviously if they start yelling at it uh
we can pick that up and go on like sorry
if they start yelling at you can say
sorry and continue on or do something
different we can actually prompt it to
to handle that situation I don't
typically necessarily use this feature a
whole here I haven't tested it enough to
see what the accuracy is um but that's
definitely something that you could use
uh if you wanted to create a much more
sort of humanlike system where obviously
someone's yelling at it it's not just
going to continue on uh like like
nothing has happened so that is it for
the model settings I'll now jump into
transcriber so the reason that this is
actually important is that obviously the
way that the information is interpreted
determines what it's going to go ahead
and understand and output so if we say
something and it obviously transcribes
it wrong as being something different
the model is going to then generate an
answer that's completely different to
the question we had asked it now vapy
does have two different providers for
the transcriptions you should probably
test this depending on the sort of
accent I think is probably going to be
the most important thing in terms of the
providers for transcription so if
somebody isn't necessarily fluent at
speaking a particular language uh the
provider and the transcriber uh is going
to be pretty critical in that process so
really playing around with this and
making sure that it's consistent in
transcribing the text that your users or
your target audience in your country in
your accent uh is going to be able to
perform better because obviously we
don't want it to trans transcribe
something that we've said to be
something completely different cuz
that's going to mess up the entire sort
of flow cuz obviously this is
transcribing a voice putting it into
text and then sending it to the AI model
now jumping into the voice settings this
is one of the most important parts of
building our assistance this is where we
control how the assistant actually
sounds so the first settings that we get
at the top here is the provider so once
again there are multiple different
providers for generating the sound so in
this case what happens is we obviously
send a question by asking it it's then
transcri cribed the AI model receives
that transcription of text that text is
then sent to this provider that we've
chosen so in this case I've set 11 Labs
11 Labs would receive that text it would
then obviously turn it into an AI voice
uh response send it back to vapy and
then repeat it to the user over the
phone now we use 11 labs for all of our
builds but there are a multitude of
different options uh for different types
of voices some might sound better for
different use cases for different
scripts that needs to read or different
accents uh that you want to get but I
mostly use 11 Labs there's also
different costs associated with
different providers I believe that the
provider for a voice is one of the most
expensive parts of these systems so if
you look at the bar at the top here
these are all the different costs
associated with the per minute cost of
running the assistant and this yellow
bit is 11 Labs so taking up quite a bit
of the entire cost here is 11 Labs we
can reduce this by obviously choosing
different models if we choose something
like lmnt it's going to go down to 3
cents choose 11 Labs it's now up to 4
cents uh so obviously different voices
uh and different providers are going to
cost different amounts scrolling down
further we've got our additional
configurations one that I really like is
the background sound so we can actually
choose to add a background sound to our
callers so at the moment they've got
either an office sound or just nothing I
believe they are adding functionality to
upload Custom Sounds alth they're just
going to add a bunch of different sort
of default sounds in here as well this
one again adds to the realism if you're
being called by a call center it's
probably going to sound like an office
uh in the background so you can just
toggle that on if it's relevant to your
assistant obviously so just below this
we've got punctuation as well now this
is a really important function that
allows us to create sort of silences and
breaks during our conversation so we
want to essentially enable the different
types of characters and these characters
correspond with different sort of
responses to the AI now I will cover
this further in the prompt engineering
part of this video but ultimately
characters like the sort of dashes or
the commas or the pauses these different
types of characters make the response
generate a bit differently so if we
wanted to say something pause for a
little bit and then continue on we want
to actually enable these characters to
be able to be read by vapy and then to
actually create those pauses in the
conversation once again I'll go through
this more in the prompt engineering part
of this video but ultimately just enable
the ones you want to use and then
include them in your prompt and then
it'll obviously pick them up through
vapy and then create those pauses for
you now just below the punctuation we
have filler injection so I've just asked
the AI to give a bit of a better
response for what fillers are so in this
case fillers refer to words or sounds
that people often use in natural speech
to pause thought to hesitate or to
signify that they are still speaking
while they organize their thoughts so
it's given us some examples here um are
like stuff like this when people are
thinking organizing their thoughts we're
able to obviously input these types of
things to make it a bit more natural uh
and less robotic like it says so by
enabling this it's just going to be a
little bit more realistic it's going to
be pausing on its thoughts um and
collecting its thoughts and it's going
to sound a little less robotic so just
below this we've got back channeling now
back channeling is similar but different
to the fillers so in this case whilst
the bot is listening to what your the
the user is saying it's just going to be
like M or confirm what they're saying as
well so it's going to be making it sound
a bit more natural as well so ultimately
the fillers are for when the bot is
actually talking itself and it's trying
to generate its thoughts it might just
start to pause a little bit make it
sound a bit more realistic and that it's
not consistently outputting information
all the time and this is for when it's
not speaking and it's actually listening
it's going to make these sort of sounds
and just below this we've got model now
this is for 11 Labs specifically but
what we would choose is right here it
says use 11 lab as multilingual if
you're using a non-english transcriber
otherwise use 11 Labs turbo so just
going to be using a Lev Labs turbo I'm
not using the multilingual function but
if you were you can go go ahead and use
this one uh if you're not using English
and you want to use it for a different
language so now just below this we've
got four different sort of
configurations for the model one being
stability Clarity plus similarity style
exaggeration and then optimizing the
streaming latency so for stability this
is how sort of expressive and emotional
we want the responses to be so if I
hover over this increasing variability
can make speech more expressive with
output variation between regenerations
it can also lead to instabilities so if
I go ahead and drag this all the way
down we're going to get a much more sort
of vibrant more emotional uh more sort
of realistic sounding system because
it's obviously more expressive sounds a
bit more realistic and reacts to the
sort of emotions a bit better however
this does cause instabilities but if we
go down to the N for stability
increasing stability will make the voice
more consistent between regenerations
but I can also make it sound a bit
monotone so on longer text fragments we
can recommend lowering this value so
we've got two sort of options here we
can either go really low variable output
and this is going to be very expressive
very emotional but the chances are it's
probably going to mess up and cause some
artifacts that are going to make it
sound really unrealistic so I like to
keep it sort of in the middle at 0. five
potentially 6 uh and it really depends
on the Voice provider or The Voice
Assistant that you're using as well in
terms of stability making it monotone
can work really well for some voices but
some voices might not sound really good
if it's very monotone and it depends on
the purpose of the assistant as well
obviously if we're using sort of a call
center replacement system it's probably
fine if they're not you know jumping
around all the time but if we're
building a salesperson for Real Estate
or something maybe we want it to be a
bit more expressive we want to lower
this value to get a bit more emotion out
of them now below this we've got Clarity
plus similarity so putting this on high
enhances the overall voice Clarity and
Target speaker similarity so very high
values could also cause artifacts so
really adjusting the setting to find the
optimal value is encouraged that's what
it says so increasing this uh can really
help to make it sound very similar so in
some cases depending on the assistant
once again this really requires a lot of
testing um you really got to just
configure this play around with it and
get it to be really good but ultimately
if we drag this all the way up here it's
going to sound very similar and be very
consistent but the downside is that it
could cause sort of artifacts cuz it's
trying to meet that same sort of similar
sound every time it's it's working a
little bit harder to do that so I like
to keep this at about 6 uh once again
sort of in the middle area 7 Maybe
but if we go all the way too low we can
get a bit better consistency less likely
to break however obviously it's going to
be a little less uh emotional it's going
to be a little less consistent so the
outputs might sound a little bit
different so it's not going to be 100%
super realistic um but once again put it
in the middle I think that's a safe bet
and that's what I've been using once
again it really depends on the voice
sound that you're using um and it could
really brange depending on whatever that
is now style exaggeration very similar
to stability I say exaggeration is
really exaggerating the audio and the in
the speech so if we want it to be a lot
more emotional and we want it to have
that level of realism and not so
monotone saying the same sort of level
of voice at the same time we can
increase this up to exaggerated I do
keep it at zero it does say here that
sending it to zero will greatly increase
the generation speed so if you want it
to be quicker as well increasing this to
be quicker uh but obviously I like this
because it's just more consistent it's
more stable to keep it at this
and I find that generation at this it's
still pretty quick and sounds pretty
good but maybe keeping this at about.
2.3 uh might be good as well now below
this we've got streaming latency if we
want to increase the latency on how long
it takes to respond we can do that if
we'd like as well the default value is
set to one so I like to just keep it
there and then finally for the voice
settings we've got our used speaker
boost this boosts the similarity of the
speech and the voice at the cost of some
generation speed so you can simply just
to with that on if you'd like to use it
and it supposed going to just keep it
consistent in how it says so one
sentence should sound very similar to
the next sentence um and you can just
enable that by toggling it once again
you really just need to test all the
different settings put them in
completely different configurations call
it a few times and really just test is
it actually working is it generating
consistent accurate and realistic sounds
if not make some changes and all these
settings should assist you in getting a
really realistic sounding system all
from this voice settings I'm now going
to jump into the function settings so
functions are the like I said earlier
functions are the sort of custom
automations that we're going to run in
the background or after our assistant
has called somebody so for this
particular example for this sort of
pizza store I've created a function
called order so in this case we're
actually capturing an order if we want
to talk to the user capture their order
details about what they want to buy
where they live what their name is we
want to capture this data and send that
data off to obviously maybe some sort of
ordering system so in this case we've
created a function and this function uh
by simply just click create a new
function we have given it a name called
order because we're creating an order
we've given a description called This is
where the details of the order will be
stored only run this once uh once all
properties are complete so this is our
sort of prompt uh to give it the context
as to when to actually run this function
and then within our functions we can
have properties and properties are the
specific data points that we want to
capture for our function obviously if
we're capturing an order what are the
bits of information that we want to
capture within that order well in this
case I've created a property by clicking
on properties creating a new property
I've created one called name and name is
the name of the custom of course and
then this is set to a string so that is
just text uh and then pretty simple just
create property add in the description
as to what you want to capture and this
will automatically capture that name
information so this will essentially run
in the background this will be
constantly looking for the name of the
customer and then it will constantly
look for our other properties as well so
I've got items this is a list of all the
items ordered by the customer this
should include the exact food name and
exact food size I've got this set to an
array so an array is essentially just
like a list so obviously if somebody
orders two pizzas or they order two
different types of pizzas we want to
list that out in what's called an array
and we can do that by selecting that
option going down to address we want to
store the customer's full address
because we want to know where to send
the order to uh in this case I've
selected string again also they've got a
Boolean which is sort of like a true or
false um so if we wanted to essentially
do the League qualification system we
could say are they qualified yes or no
or true or false that's the Boolean uh
value we can do number so if we wanted
to actually get the order value order
total or number specifically we can use
the number so hopefully that's pretty
straightforward ultimately we're just
capturing a set of values to then send
off to a particular endpoint now for
this endpoint I've got a URL here and
this URL is a make.com web hook now when
I cover make.com you're going to get a
much better understanding of exactly
where this has come from how this works
and what exactly this URL is used for
But ultimately all this is doing is
sending data off to make.com if you
remember that is our automations
platform that going to process this data
and then do something with it whether
it's just storing the data or it's
actually then sending that off to in
this case maybe the kitchen however that
would happen we can do that through
me.com scrolling down a bit they
actually have some predefined functions
as well so in this case we've got an
enable end call function and this will
allow the assistant to end the call from
its side so if we want the assistant to
end the call and not them we can
actually just toggle this on and go down
scroll down all the way to the bottom
and type in an end call phrase so this
enle phrase is just something that the
assistant would say uh and then it would
trigger the bot to simply just end the
call so if we wanted to prompt it to
Output uh thanks for the call uh we'll
speak to you later goodbye and we could
essentially take that phrase put that
into this part of the prompt right here
and then every time
anytime it ESS says that it will just
end the call itself and so that way
you're not just stuck on a call this can
help with cost efficiency as well
obviously you don't want them to be
stuck on the call using up valuable
minutes uh it'll just end it right away
uh so that's a good function to enable
another one of the predefine functions
is dialing the keypad so we're can
actually get the assist to actually dial
the keypad I've also asked the AI here
to give you a bit of a better
explanation but we can see here this
feature is part of additional
capabilities given to vapy assistants
allowing them to perform actions Beyond
simple conversation such as transferring
calls ending calls and in this case
interacting with keypads during calls so
we can interact with the keypad with
that function and just below this we've
also got the folding phone number
function now the folding phone number
function uh essentially folds the phone
number depending on a set of conditions
so we can enter in our phone number
right here and then in our prompt we can
say if something happens or if this
specific thing happens or this specific
thing is said forward the phone number
so that sort of forward the phone pH
number is already automatically prompted
into this predefined function uh and it
will automatically start to fold the
phone number to this phone number uh and
so you can set that to your own phone
number and if something bad happens
it'll automatically start to call you
and then you can take over and handle
the call from there so that is it for
the functions section once again I'm
going to go through a bit more into the
specific building out of the functions
uh through the mac.com walkthrough now
jumping into the advanced section these
settings you don't necessarily need to
use I don't particularly use them that
often but it is good to know what
settings are available to you through
the advanced settings so the first
setting that we have here is the Hipp
compliance setting now the Hipp
compliance setting is specifically for
medical uh use cases so if you're using
this in the sort of medical area uh
obviously being able to be Hipp
compliant is probably going to be
required for that particular assistant
and you can do that through vapy simply
just enable it and one of the things
that you'll notice it's just done is
actually disabled recordings so
obviously for Hipp compliance uh you
can't record the calls especially if
it's going to be handled sensitive
information so one good feature there
enabling Hipp compliance but obviously
if you don't need Hipp compliance you
can turn that off and then you actually
allow to Now record the calls enable
that we can actually record the
conversation with the assistant and so
these recordings are stored in the call
logs like I showed you earlier so just
enable that and then go to call logs and
you can just play any of the recordings
that you'd like now just below this
we've got pipeline configuration and
these are just another host of settings
that we can use to configure some of the
delays interruptions um for our
particular voice system so so the first
one is the silence timeout so this is
just how long it waits for the person to
respond back so at the moment it's set
to 30 seconds uh I'd like to keep that a
bit lower maybe 10 seconds obviously you
don't want to be sitting there for 30
seconds waiting for them to respond
chances are they didn't hear you they
didn't hear what you said uh and so you
want to keep that really low
particularly from what I've seen maybe
you want to increase that depending on
the system's use case uh but keeping
that low makes it a little bit more
natural for my experience then we've got
the response delay this is how delayed
it is in responding to the user's
question that it sent us uh I like to
keep this at other zero or 0.1 obviously
I want the least amount of delay
possible um but depending on the use
case you can increase that if required
large language model request DeLay So
This is how delayed it is in actually
generating its answers once again sort
of similar to the response delay really
just got to play around with this uh and
see whether or not it suits your
particular assistant once again I like
to keep this on the low side of things
to keep the delay as minimal as possible
so next option here is the number of
words to actually interrupt the
assistant so when we're talking to the
bot we can actually say something while
it's talking and it's going to stop and
it's going to obviously wait for what we
have to say and then continue on again
so it's actually recognizing that we're
saying stuff um and it's making it a bit
more natural in that sense so one of the
configurations we can change is the
amount of words to actually detect when
to interrupt the assistant so if we set
that to one word it will pick up if you
said one word it'll stop the assistant
now you do have to be a bit careful with
this one if we set it to one word word
and then the person on the phone coughs
or something happens they make a noise
it might pick it up as a word and
interrupt the assistant and it's going
to be a bit awkward if it's just stuck
there waiting for how long your silence
time out is that's why I like to keep it
about two or 3 words just to really
confirm they have started talking about
something and that we do need to stop
talking then finally we've got the
maximum duration and this is the max
amount of time that we want the call to
go for so we can set limits as to how
long the calls are going to be this is
going to be helpful for managing cost
once again so obviously if we're sending
out thousands of calls we do want to
make sure that obviously these calls
aren't going for an hour each because
then obviously that's going to use up a
lot of our cost per minute so we can
just reduce this to a set of minutes
that we want to keep it to so if the
call should only take 5 minutes at Max
just set it to 5 minutes and then
obviously if it's hit past 5 minutes um
then it's probably just going to have to
just going to have to take that loss uh
if you're trying to talk to a lead or
something obviously if it's going on for
5 minutes it should probably end anyway
um but it should that really comes down
to your prompting once again making sure
that the assistant is efficient what
it's saying it doesn't go off on
tangents and talk to them about random
stuff it just goes down the script
follows exactly what it needs to say and
gets the call done as quickly as
possible to save on costs uh but we can
once again really help reduce that by
putting in a maximum call duration now
further scrolling down we've got more
sort of advanced settings here that are
really used for some of the custom
coding side of things on vapi in this
case we can put in a URL um to actually
send all the information that's
occurring through the assistant so
function calls uh Ender call reports
anything that's happening it can be sent
off to a particular URL uh so we can set
that up using mac.com if you'd like once
again not necessarily required for
building out your first assistant but
something to look into if you want to
actually control um sort of whatever is
happening to the assistant and get all
of that data back this is where you
would do that by putting in your server
URL the same goes with the client
messages these are messages that are
going to be sent off to a different
endpoint we can choose all different
data that we're sending off so very
similar to the server Your Role
configure all of the data and how that's
managed through those settings server
messages once again very similar uh so
if we want to choose what's being sent
off here we can just say we want the end
call report function calls updates we
can have that all sent off live during
the call then below this a feature that
is actually pretty useful is the
voicemail message so if the assistant
goes to VOA it's forwarded to voicemail
we can actually have it say something um
just right here so we can say you've
reached our voicemail please leave a
message after the beep and we'll get
back to as soon as possible so that's a
default text that they've put in there
it'll just say this um to the assistant
uh if it gets sent and forwarded to
voicemail then all the way at the bottom
here we've got an end of call message so
if the assistant identifies that it
needs end the call through our prompt
it'll just red out out this message so
you can say thank you for contacting us
have a great day uh so it just ends off
the call on a on a more natural note so
that is it for our vapy walkthrough
hopefully now you're much more up to
speed as to exactly what vapy is what
the functions do what the capabilities
of V are and you should now be more than
prepared to be a to actually start
building these systems for both the
inbound and outbound callers now jumping
into make.com the automations platform
that we're going to use to mostly build
our functions and connect to vapy to run
automations in the background so this
right here is make.com this is
essentially a noode automations platform
you can see here this is essentially
what it looks like so we're able to
process automations and communicate
information between different
applications uh through this sort of
step-by-step workflow so this is a no
code workflow automations platform and
one of the really big benefits of
make.com is that it is connected to
thousands and thousands of different
applications as you can see here we can
essentially just load a whole heap of
different applications that we can
communicate to for different purposes so
one of the automations that I'm going to
Showcase later in the video is going to
be a webflow form submission for our
inbound call system that's going to look
for a new webflow form submission it's
then going to use vapy to make an API
call so making an API call through make
to vapy to then call the person who had
submitted a lead form so this right here
is make.com and these are some of the
automations that I'm actually using
within my business I've got a few
automations for taking New Leads through
cendy and putting that into a notion CRM
I've got uh some automations for my
resource Hub where we can get access to
all the automation templates uh that I'm
going to be using throughout this video
in my resource Hub this essentially just
takes a form submission and then sends
that user an email I've got meeting
qualified I've got YouTube video
transcriptions my blogs so this is just
an example of a series of automations
that I've got built for my own business
uh here and automatically running on
make.com so the main thing that you're
going to be using on make.com are
scenarios and these are essentially the
automations so each scenario is a new
automation or new workflow where you're
going to build something new in so in
this instance each of these is a new
scenario if I go ahead and click into a
particular scenario each scenario is
built with a series of modules and these
modules all connect to each other so
this automation will look for all my new
YouTube videos take that YouTube video
and then turns it into a blog post and
sends it to webflow where it uploads it
to my website so each of these are
called modules and like I said it's just
a step-by-step process you take a module
it moves to the next one then the next
one and continues on until it reaches
the objective that you're looking for
we're able to add new modules by
clicking on the plus button here and
then it gives us access to all of the
applications that make has tons and tons
of applications and then when we click
on on a particular application here if I
go ahead and click on the Google
Calendar one we can see that when you
click on the application you get a host
of different events or actions to occur
particularly within that application so
in this case if we want to get a
calendar create a calendar update a
calendar delete a calendar it's got all
these sort of preset uh actions that can
occur for that API and it has that for
all of these applications so if you want
to do LinkedIn we've got all of these
different applications here as well if
we want to do Facebook Messenger more
actions so ton of different actions to
very easily do what we want through an
automation step by step uh using these
modules on Mech the way that make
charges is through operations so you can
see here I'm using the core plan $10 a
month it gives me$ 10,000 operations per
month and that's enough to run the
automations for my particular business
but in this case obviously you can
choose however many operations you need
uh and in some cases depending on the
volume of calls that you're going to be
doing I'm going to show you how to set
up the calling automation for call
calling as well as inbound calls and
you'll see exactly how many operations
that's actually going to go ahead and
use but in some cases you might need the
team's plan uh or you just you can buy
additional operations so you can really
do as many calls as you need if you are
familiar with zapia this is a lot
cheaper than zapia these operations and
their monthly costs are much cheaper
it's much more efficient than zapia so
if you're familiar with it this is a
much better option so now I'm going to
go through one of these scenarios that
will enable us to actually send data
from vapy into our make automation and
this is going to be used for our
function calls so like I showcased
previously with this sort of pizza
example running a function call to save
a pizza order what I went ahead and set
up was a series of properties to capture
the name items and address and then I
added in This Server URL now this server
URL came directly from ma.com so the URL
comes from what is called a web hook and
so in this instance of make.com the
first block here is a web hook and so
the first block in each make scenario is
where it starts from and what we've got
set set up is this web hook and this web
Hook is set to run immediately so we can
essentially send a request to a web hook
and this automation will run
automatically it's not going to wait for
anything it's just going to run right
away so by just clicking on this web
hook here once you create a web hook
it's going to go ahead and just give you
a URL very simply we can just click on
this create a web hook it'll
automatically generate a URL for us
click copy address to clipboard go back
to vapy and paste it in your server URL
and now when you're making calls it's
going to start to send and connect
Direct with make.com and then what we
have to do after this is add in whatever
application we want to send the data
into so in this case what it's going to
do is send essentially a list of
information that says name item address
and within those properties are going to
be the obviously data assigned with
those values and we're going to see that
on mac.com and by using maybe something
like Google Sheets we can then save that
data uh into Google Sheets so hopefully
you can see how simple mac.com is and
how easy it is to actually connect
directly to vapy to run a whole host of
automations where we just need a web
hook to send the data into and then we
can get connected to the thousands of
applications that make provides us with
and we can send that data off to
wherever we want and do whatever we want
with it now additionally if we wanted to
send data back into the bot we can do
that as well and all we need to use is a
web hook response and in this case we
can send the web hook to any type of
application manipulate that data change
that data send a request to get
information back and then send it back
to vapy now the purpose of of doing this
is maybe we want to search up the price
of Bitcoin if we wanted to get any type
of live data we need to obviously make a
request somewhere because it's obviously
not going to be stored within our prompt
or anything we need to get that live
data back and we can do a webook
response very simply once this process
here has occurred it's just going to
land on the web hook response we can
just add in whatever bit of data we want
to from here and then this will get sent
directly back to vapy vapy Will
automatically process this data so we
can just send send it back whatever we
want and then if it finds it relevant to
talk about it will just use that
information because it's being sent into
the prompt um and it's trying to use
that information as best as it can uh to
really help make a really fluent
conversation so hopefully you now have a
really good understanding of how
make.com can directly connect to vappy
for function calls and automations I'm
now going to go into prompt engineering
for AI voice callers to get you ready to
actually start building inbound and
outbound callers right into it prompt
engineering how to properly build AI
phone calls well just going back a
little bit I'll go through what actual
prompts are so an AI prompt is really
any form of text question information or
coding that communicates to AI what
response you're looking for so by using
natural language we can actually
communicate with the AI so in this case
we are building sort of a set of
instructions for the AI to follow to
assist us for specific needs so what
does this actually look like well AI
phone caller developer platforms such as
vapy allows for the input of prompts to
control our assistance so I've got a
screenshot of the platform vapy on the
right here I'm going to go through what
vapy is in just a second but essentially
what we're able to do is provide a set
of instructions using natural language
so we're essentially just talking to it
like we're talking to a human and we're
just telling it how to act so we use
vapy for all our voice projects so vapy
enables us to build pretty Advanced
callers that sound quite realistic they
respond quickly and can interpret our
prompts accurately there are a host of
features that VAP provides which you
will learn throughout this video as well
now back to the prompts the AI model can
actually interpret this prompt and
follow the instructions which then
guides its responses so it's actually
reading this prompt and it's using this
prompt to guide its responses and act
the way we told it to the AI will also
have memory so it's going to actually
understand any previous questions and
answers we've given it and that's going
to get fed back into the prompt so it
has that sort of context just very
briefly I'm going to go over what a
large language model is a large language
model are very large deep learning
models that are pre-trained on vast
amounts of data so just think of this as
the brain of the AI assistant this brain
is trained on lots of information and
it's able to contextualize the prompt
and instructions we've given it and turn
that into something that is more natural
sounding so this graph here gives you a
better idea of how the actual sort of
memory works so what happens is that we
prompt the assistant and then this gets
sent to the AI it's then outputed to the
user but then that output goes into what
is called a context window and the
context window is just giving the AI
more information to work with and in
this case we're giving it the previous
questions in that context window to add
context to the conversation that's
happening so what actually is prompt
engineering well prompt engineering is
just the process of actually structuring
and instruction that can be interpreted
and understood by a generative AI model
so this is the process of actually
creating our prompts now prompt
engineering has become quite an in
demand role for businesses due to the
expanding need for generative AI in
businesses so as you can see on the
right there AI prompt Engineers earn
$300,000 salaries this clearly shows
that businesses can see the value in AI
prompt engineering and that there's
definitely a future for being able to
learn this exact skill so why is this
actually important why are prompts
important and why is prompt engineering
something that's so valuable while
prompts are really the most integral
part of building these AI agents so
without really clear instructions for
our intended outputs from these systems
can actually start to Output what we
call hallucinations so hallucinations
are incorrect or misleading results that
AI models generate so when an AI is not
instructed clearly the output from the
AI will change from what was intended
now this really highlights the
importance of prompting and testing one
of the solutions to hallucinations is
guard rails so for specific AI agents
you may not want the AI to actually
deviate from its intend and purpose so
for example a sales agent should stay on
script and not Converse about random
relevant topics that the user inquires
about it should just stick to that sales
script that we've given it to follow
with that to then obviously meet the
call objective so if that call objective
was to set an appointment we would put
in place a set of guard rails to ensure
that that we get to that call outcome
and that if somebody says something it
doesn't go down a tangent or go down
some random irrelevant topics and start
talking about those things and never end
up booking the appointment now on to
knowledge bases AI power knowledge bases
are comprehensive repositories of
information made up of several different
kinds of content so we can store large
amounts of information outside of our
prompt and then retrieve that relevant
information from the knowledge base
without needing to include everything in
the prompt so when a user asks a
question before asking the AI before
sort of prompting uh the AI to then
generate a response we're can actually
search the knowledge base for anything
that seems relevant or similar to the
information or the question that they
just asked and it's doing that by using
its semantic meaning so then if this
question correlates to any of the
information within our knowledge base
we're going to then go ahead and pull
that information pull that chunk of
information from our knowledge base and
then put it into the prompt so then the
AI has the context like that context
window I talked about it's putting that
information from the knowledge base in
the context window to refer to when
answering the question now the reason
that we actually use a knowledge base is
something called prompt efficiency so
we're doing this to save on costs now it
is possible to store large amounts of
information directly into our prompt
however the more we input into the
prompt the greater the generation cost
will actually be now this does depend on
the project requirements and the actual
voice system that you're building so it
may be better to store certain
information into the prompt or it might
be better to upload all of the
information into a knowledge base it
just comes out to testing the outputs on
to testing creating a prompt is not as
simple as just getting it right the
first time you'll probably notice that
to actually create the assistant is
pretty quick you can get an assistant
built in probably 10 minutes if you just
give it a very straightforward prompt
that is only one or two sentences you
can get it to act different and you can
get it to act the way you want in about
two sentences however this is not going
to be consistent it's not going to be
reliable uh and you're going to need to
a lot more than that to get it working
well and so like I put here even if the
conversation seems normal initially and
it does do what you want and it gets
that call
variations of conversation can cause
hallucinations so one answer different
to the what the script says it's going
to cause a hallucination if somebody
responds with a word that it wasn't
expecting it could cause a hallucination
and it could breach those guard rils
were built so there's a lot that needs
to be done in testing to make sure this
works properly so that's why I think
that testing is the most important phase
in actually creating your prompt so
something that we do at our agency we
actually analyze the transcripts of the
conversations and use this data to
continuously improve the prompt to
ensure reliability so this is once again
something that we extensively value
within our agency because getting an
assistant running is pretty quick but
getting an assistant to reliably and
consistently meet the call objectives
that takes a lot of time to perfect I
will come back to testing and data later
when I cover more of the key Concepts so
this here is the prompt life cycle and
the reason I put this in here is to
really reiterate the importance of
testing so you can see here the first
two stages are design so that's sort of
creating our prompt thinking of what our
prompt is going to be implementation
which is then when our prompt is ready
to go and we can now use it and test it
and start meeting those call objectives
evaluation is when we can actually start
running these tests and getting data
back refinement is then taking that data
and then improving Upon Our script
iteration is then testing different
prompts to meet those call objectives
maybe we found that the refinement
wasn't enough and we needed to iterate
over different methods to finally get to
something good validation is then
testing these different iterations to
make sure it's actually working properly
and then finally we're deploying it to
their end users and testing with real
people and then we're doing maintenance
to actually ensure that it is working
and we're consistently checking to see
if this thing is actually doing what
it's meant to so of these eight steps of
the life cycle of a prompt only two were
for actually getting it set up
everything else was to do with testing
and deploying through the evaluation
iteration validation this is all to do
with testing and only step one and two
was actually building it so hopefully
that gives you a better idea as to the
importance and value of testing prompts
which is something that we deeply value
uh within our agency so how we actually
structure our prompts there is no really
one siiz fits-all structure depending on
the complexity of this system it may
require a couple of twixs or it may
require thousands of users to actually
test and then the data needs to be
analyzed and adjustments made it really
depends on how easy it is to meet those
call objectives how many questions we're
asking the user and what these specific
actions we're looking to do are so
jumping into the prompt structure the
first thing that we will go through is
the role so who they actually are and
who they are is the assistants we're
talking to the assist assistant here the
role of the assistant directly aims to
communicate to the AI who they are for
example A salesperson or a lead
qualifier an appointment setter or
technical support we would tell the AI
who they are so the purpose of this is
to ensure that the AI aligns its output
with who they are so obviously a
salesperson should sell an appointment
setter should set appointments now this
will also impact the personality of the
responses so prompting it to be a
salesperson can cause it to be a bit
more descriptive because they're trying
to convince them to make a sale and then
prompting it to assist users as maybe a
technical support person can make its
answers more structured and step by step
as it's trying to break down problems
and make it easy to understand so
jumping into vy. here I'm going to do
the walkthrough of actually building out
an assistant which is going to be an
inbound sales assistant for Apple so in
this case to build our role this is what
our role would look like so who they are
you are an experienced salesperson for
the technology company Apple Your Role
is to help customers purchase our
products so very simply uh you can
expand upon this obviously but very
fundamentally the role is just telling
it who they are moving on to the next
part of our prompt we're then going to
cover what they actually do and this is
going to be the task so this is a more
specific goal for the assistant to
actually align its responses with for
example we could say that your task is
to qualify leads or your task is to set
appointments your task is to convince
customers to buy our products so jumping
back into vapy in this case for our
inbound sales assistant for Apple we
could say that their task is to converse
with the customer find their needs solve
their pay points and sell them our
products the third part of our prompt
are the specifics so how they actually
do it this is how they actually should
achieve the task that we just set out
for them so for example follow a sales
script so if we wanted to build a A
salesperson and we told them that the
point is to sell them products we might
tell them to follow a sales script more
specifically to make that happen or
collect a name and email to book an
appointment so if it's an appointment
set up we then want to more specifically
tell it we're actually going to be
collecting the name and email to book
the appointment so for our inbound sales
caller at Apple we will then say for our
specifics you are a highly intelligent
salesperson you will converse with the
customer about the specifications of our
products you must closely follow the
scripts provided these specifics are
very important to my career please
follow these your ability to closely
follow the scripts is integral to the
business's bottom line now you'll notice
that I said you must closely follow the
scripts provided now I haven't provided
the scripts in this section I'll come
back to that in just a second now I
haven't provided the scripts in this
section I'll actually come back to that
in just a second but just make sure that
if we are following a cell script that
it needs to be in the specifics cuz
that's what it's going to be closely
following to achieve the objective of
the task and for this last line here
this is something called emotional
prompting and I will come back to this
as well now the fourth step in our
prompt is the context so this will
ensure that the AI has actually got
complete knowledge on why they're
actually doing what they're doing and
this just gives the AI a sense of
purpose uh which is actually proven to
increase output results so obviously the
more that we remind of the key
objectives if it's a cell sales person
the more that we remind it that it is a
salesperson the more that it's going to
align its output with that so iny for
the context this is how that would look
we would just put context so we put the
business we are Apple Inc and we provide
technology products to the world for
example the iPhone and iPad obviously if
you were actually building this for
Apple you would have it a bit more
extensive and a bit more accurate but
obviously I'm just trying to demonstrate
the purpose of these contact points and
how that is me to help out in the entire
script below this we've got the what we
do so this is we help people connect
digitally with worldclass devices once
again this is quite a broad example with
such a large company but if you had a
very specific company maybe it's a real
estate agency and you wanted to clearly
outline what we do it's going to help
the AI just get a better understanding
on exactly what its purpose is to align
its outputs with exactly what it should
be doing just quickly I wanted to cover
markdown formatting which is something
that you can use to more contextually
communicate the different parts of your
prompt to the AI so in the case of
prompting the context to the AI we can
actually have different sections and
subsections of the context and we can
separate this using markdown formatting
so markdown formatting is really just a
way of separating elements of our prompt
and markdown formatting is something
that open AI actually used to train
their AI models so just by splitting up
the headings of our different sections
of the prompt for example we can see
here we've got the context and it's got
a hashtag in front of it so that's what
markdown formatting is it's essentially
just putting in these hashtags to
separate the different headings and that
is essentially just marking those as
different headings communicating to the
AI giving it a bit more structure
as to what is relevant to what so in the
case of context we've got context with
the one hashtag and we've got the
business so now it knows that the
business is related to context so it's
actually looking for the context of the
business so you can see how the AI might
get confused there of what it's actually
talking about but by using this markdown
formatting we're now able to more easily
communicate the different structures of
our prompt it's going to be much more
able to find what it's looking for and
output much more accurate answers so
like I just said open a trained their
models knowledge using markdown
formatting so this format will ensure an
increase in the accuracy when actually
ranking elements of the prompt in
specific outputs some parts of the
prompt won't be required and some parts
will be required so sort of just clearly
identifying that with headings ensure
that it's just less work for the AI to
try and figure out what the answer is
now number five examples this is going
to be the most powerful aspect of our
prompt engineering so this is where we
directly State example inputs and
corresponding outputs so like I just
mentioned earlier where we referenced
the cell script this is where we then
put in the Sal script cuz this is the
example that we wanted to follow in this
case I've got a script here very basic
but we would position this towards the
AI so we're saying you which is the AI
hello how can I help you today so
ideally that's what it will start off
the conversation with then if I said I'm
doing good I'm looking to book an
appointment we can then structure this
script to then have a response back for
that so now it's going to say sure what
day would you like to book and then if I
said does Monday work we can continue on
this script you know on and on and we
can create different script variations
as well so we're not just going to have
this as the one script we can create a
script for if they're not interested we
create a script for if they are
interested we can create script
variations and we just requires more
prompt engineering to obviously go down
the right path the right script for the
right person for the examples this is
how that would look we would just put
examples as a heading we can then put
the different scripts as different sort
of subheadings so #h sales department
script so maybe they want to talk with
the sales department we can just put in
our script so hi is this Brendan yes
looks like you're interested in iPad
something like this uh is just obviously
a very basic sales script we can go a
lot bigger than this putting that all
into the prompt so these examples really
just helps to ensure consistency in its
responses and make the AI do a lot less
work that being said following a script
requires quite significant testing so
especially to ensure a really natural
sounding conversation without really
properly conditioning it the AI will
sort of continue its script without
acknowledging the users real response so
obviously we don't want them to say
something that wasn't along the lines of
our script and then for the AI to
completely ignore what they just said
and just say something that's not even
relevant to what they just said because
it's going to be an immediate switch
that they're talking to an AI and then
they're going to lose that lead so
number six notes this is where we can
actually add our conditions and fixes so
if the conversation goes off script we
can actually tell it to bring it back to
the script whilst maintaining a seamless
conversation or we could say if a
customer asks a question deviating from
the script answer that question
accurately then flow back into the
script so once again this is just adding
in some notes this might work this might
not work you might have to add a lot
more than this to actually get it to
work properly depending on how big your
cell script is but obviously we need to
add in these notes to make it sure that
it actually understands not just to
strictly follow the script but to
accurately answer the question flow back
into the script and then meet the call
objective for our notes this is how that
would look we would just put notes as a
heading and then we can say please
ensure you follow the script closely so
just reiterating that this is an
important factor and saying if a
customer asks a question deviating from
the script answer the question
accurately then flow back into the
script so just conditioning it to Ure
sure that it's going to be outputting a
seamless conversation now in a lot of
the builds that we've done in our agency
this note section gets filled up quite a
lot so you're likely to get a lot more
than two notes in this part of the
prompt you might have 20 or 30 notes in
this prompt really covering and really
strictly prompting it to Output exactly
what you're looking for so when you're
testing and adjusting the note section
is one of the places that you can add
these adjustments to now on to function
calls so function calls isn't
necessarily a part of the prompt
structure but it is something that you
will likely need to include throughout
your prompt at different parts of the
prompt to make sure that we are running
functions so one of the reasons that we
use vapy within our agency is that it
enables us to actually pull external
data into the conversation live so for
example if we wanted to get customer
data from a CRM system or book an
appointment live we can do this via
something called a function call so this
is a screenshot from vapy and this is
what the function looks like so what
we're able to do is assign a name of a
function describe its purpose and then
add a set of properties so these
functions contain properties which are
just different bits of information that
that we actually want to send within our
function call so for example if we want
to book an appointment we would need to
actually store that person's name
booking day booking time Etc so we can
do that using properties so we would
create a property called booking time we
will create a a property called booking
day and then we would create a property
called name and so we can store all of
that information uh into the function
call that will occur so we use a
platform called ma.com to actually run
the automation from vapy to the
application we want to send or retrieve
data from so if we wanted to send
information to a CRM system we would
make the request to me.com that would
then send the information to our CRM
system so if you are familiar with zapia
at all make is just a very simple
platform it enables us to communicate
data between different applications
quite easily let me know if you would
like to see a more extensive maybe 1
hour plus voice caller build video in
the comments below so these functions do
require further prompting elements so if
we want to send an SMS to the actual
caller we need to actually prompt this
action based on the function name set in
vapy for example if we created a
function for sending smss and we call it
the SMS function uh we could essentially
just say run this SMS function when the
user requests to receive our quote so if
we're building some sort of quote
assistant we could create a function
that sends somebody a quote based on the
compensation they just had and that
happens through a function called SMS so
the functions within vapy are quite
smart and they can automatically detect
which information is required to
actually run the function so in this
case it could look through the
conversation that just occurred find
some elements that's required to put
together a quote and send it to them via
an SMS assuming that we've got all of
the properties set up to capture all
that data we can send all of that data
off do something like twio on make.com
twio is just like an SMS platform and
then we can have an SMS sent to a user
live during our phone caller
conversation so jumping into some of the
voice configurations emotion prompting
is where we sort of highlight the
importance of certain prompt elements so
like I mentioned in the specific part of
my prompt I said this is very important
to my career now the reason we put that
in there is to once again just highlight
more importance to what we said so for
the specifics I said that I wanted to
follow a sales script and in this case
that is one of the most critical parts
of the sort of sales system we're
building so that's why I said this part
specifically is very important to my
career and it's obvious just train to
know that something that's important to
your career it's probably something that
it should stick to and make sure it does
properly and so that's just how the AI
is trained and by putting it in there it
is actually proven to Output better
results as you can see with the article
on the right here emotionally word
prompts can actually get generative AI
to generate better answers another
example of this could be are you sure
that that's your final answer it might
be worth taking another look so once
again it's just a very strict prompt
that's saying make sure you're doing it
properly this is important because of
this and then these bits of sentences
stacked up uh to Target maybe following
a cell script it's something that can
actually really work to get it to Output
consistently another key part of the
voice configuration is 11 Labs so 11
Labs is a realistic voice provider
platform so we will connect with 11 labs
to get access access to sort of
realistic sounding voices to speak our
AI generated responses 11 Labs also has
a public voice library with many
different accents and personalities 11
Labs also allows you to clone your own
voice something that I've done and you
can also integrate this directly into
your VAP system as well if you'd like
they've also got documentation on sort
of different text elements that affect
how the output sounds so this is
something that we need to include into
our voice caller prompts for example
adding in sort of two dashes at a time
will create brief pauses and you can
also do sort of singular dashes so it
Dash is Dash getting late so you can
really break up sentences using the
dashes in 11 Labs or you can use an
ellipsis like I dot dot dot yeah I guess
so so you can just break up sentences
using different characters so you can
just break up sentences using different
characters based on the processing that
11 Labs does now for the voice realism
usually people will sort of stutter
words and have pauses such as um so impr
prompting we can actually use a variety
of combinations to get this effect it
could be spelled like uhm um AR om or r
so we can actually get all these
different ranges of sort of breaks and
silences or pauses during the
conversation through this and so 11 Labs
can actually process these and output
some pretty natural sounds now once
again these 11 Labs configurations need
to be prompted to be outputed in our
notee section we could say please output
a series of dashes when you believe a
pause is required now the way that vapy
and 11 lab sort of talk to each other is
that vapy does all of the AI generation
in all of the text and the actual
response that it's going to say and then
it sends that off to 11 labs to process
and turn into a voice that is sent back
to vappy and then communicated to the
caller now the key thing there is that
vappy does the text processing and sends
it to 11 Labs so if you tell the prompt
to include the dashes it's likely that
vapy might not actually generate these
dashes so then when the response comes
back from 11 Labs we might not do the
pauses or say stuff exactly how we
wanted it to because 11 Labs actually
changed it when we got the information
back so this is once again another
reason as to why testing is really
important and we just need to
continuously add conditions to ensure
that we can actually consistently and
reliably output the pauses and breaks
throughout the conversation to make it
seem really seamless so in terms of what
actually defines a sort of successful
prompt or successful Voice Assistant we
tell our clients that the outcome of
these voice systems really ranges from
60 to 95% now this means that the
probability of consistently following a
script or outputting similar dialogue
depending on how extensive our testing
and adjusting is Will range from either
60% similar or 95% similar now we do aim
to reach that 90% % Mark for all of our
clients however we do offer extensive
testing and measuring periods to
actually verifiably say that the system
meets those expectations so I hope that
was a helpful video in understanding how
to prompt AI voice callers and that you
now have a better understanding of the
different elements that are required to
build a sophisticated AI Voice Assistant
if you are a business owner and you're
interested in an AI voice system go
ahead and book a call with my team below
and we can discuss the project that you
have in mind we've also got an
alternative consultation call where we
actually find out how this a voicey
system can be implemented into your
business if you did want to get access
to 20 plus chatbot and automation
templates as well as an invite to our
school Community just sign up for our
free resource Hub in the description I'd
greatly appreciate it if you'd like the
video and subscribe to the channel as
I've got a lot more content around AI
voice callers lined
up so the first part of my prompt here
is a role and a role defines who they
are so this is for the bot who the bot
is so as I said you are an experienced
travel assistant salesperson Your Role
is to ask customers if they want to
purch just lifetime travel insurance so
I've just made up a random thing
lifetime travel insurance um obviously
this could really sell anything you want
but this is just insurance it's selling
the insurance um and that's its goal
that's who it is the key thing here is
that the bot should now know that this
is its job it is an experienced travel
insurance sales person and it needs to
strictly follow the script that's
provided the reason that we do this is
that the bot now knows exactly what it
is it knows that it's an experienced
travel insurance salesperson and that it
shouldn't go off on a tangent talking
about some random things because it
knows that its goal is to be a
salesperson and to ask customers if they
want to purchase our services the next
heading I've got here in my prompt is
what they do or the task so your task is
to converse with the customer using the
provided script and determine if they
would be interested in purching our
services so once again it's really just
being strict on what your job is as an
assistant so by saying your task is
converse with a customer and ask them if
they're interested in our services it
knows it has one task and that task is
to ask them if they're interested and
capture that question this way once
again it's not just going to go off on a
tangent and start asking them questions
about insurance that it's not relevant
cuz we simply want to know whether or
not they're interested or they're not
interested to qualify that lead the next
section I have here is specifics and
specifics are how it actually achieves
that task so I've gone ahead and said
you are a high converting salesperson
who must closely follow the provided
script you are capable of answering any
question the customer provides however
you are an expert at Flowing the
conversation back into the script and
asking the qualifying questions within
the sales script so this is really just
going into more detail as to how you're
going to go ahead and Achieve that task
which is ensuring that if a question
comes through that's not relevant to the
script still try and answer that
question so that it doesn't seem like
you're a robot but then flow back into
the script so if they ask a completely
random question answer that question as
best as you can and then go back into
the script which is then asking them
whether or not they're interested in our
services the next part says these
specifics are very important to my
career please follow these your ability
to accurately follow each part of the
script whilst ensuring that each of the
customers questions are answered is
greatly appreciated so if you've
followed prompt engineering at all
you'll know that sort of hyping up the
chatbot and really appreciating the chat
bot's answers and putting that in your
prompt is actually a really good way to
get accurate results out as well as
studying the importance of what they're
doing by saying this is very important
to my career really just emphasizes more
importance on this element and this
section of the prompt so that it focuses
in on what you've actually said and
tries to follow this as best as it
possibly can the next part that I've
included is context and this is sort of
context around the business now you'll
notice that I've got this sort of
hashtag here and then two hashtags here
and so this is called markdown
formatting now markdown formatting is
just a way that we can structure our
sort of promp here to better help the AI
understand which is part of which so
I've got context and I've got context
within the business and then we've got
context in what we do so I've structured
these with two hashtags and I've
structure this with one hashtag and so
this markdown formatting is something
that open AI the creator of chat gbt
actually endorses being used within
prompts uh as that's what is actually
trained with so once you've got this
sort of structure here I've said our
company travel saver provides customers
with access to a one-time cost for
Lifetime travel insurance so once again
this is really just reiterating to the
AI that this is our services we are a
business that sells services and you
should stay in line with this and that
you shouldn't go off on a tangent and
start talking about random stuff when we
have one goal in mind and that is to
qualify customers for our one time
travel insurance next to this I've got
what we do which is we call hundreds of
people per day and your role is to talk
with these leads and accurately qualify
the ones who are interested in our
services so now it really knows exactly
what the business is exactly what they
do and knows exactly what its role is
now below this I've got examples and
these examples is essentially just the
scripts that I want the bot to follow
with so I would say this is probably the
most important part of the script cuz
this is exactly what it's going to be
following and what I'm sort of set up to
actually start following throughout all
of these other bits of the prompt I'm
saying follow the script follow the
script and so this is the script that I
wanted to strictly stick by to ask
certain amount of questions to then get
this information back for the business
to use so in this case I've got two
scripts I've got an interested example
script and I've also got a not
interested example script and so the two
scripts are if they're not interested
we're going to say something different
to whether or not they actually say that
they're interested so the way that I've
structured this script is by saying you
and so you is the actual assistant that
we're talking with and we're just
telling it what to say so you should say
hi is this Brendan and then Brendan if
he says yes you should then go say hi my
name is John I'm from a company called
travel ser and then we've got this
prompt to just say sorry for the random
call how often did you travel per year
and we just capturing some data back and
that's how we're structuring it so one
thing you might notice is that I've got
sorry for um and then it repeats the
sentence sorry for um sorry for the
super random call and the reason I've
done this is to make it sound a little
bit more natural sounding that the
person isn't just speaking perfectly all
the time and they're not stuffing up on
anything that they're saying we've
actually just put that in there to make
it a bit more human-like and it's
something that I recommend to put in as
sort of like a sentence break and to
really pause and to make it sound a
little bit more realistic during the
conversation you'll also notice here
that when I ask this question how often
do you travel per year and then somebody
responds I travel to Tokyo twice a year
for a holiday we're then running a
function so the purpose of this question
is to capture how many times the
potential client travels per year and
this is going to gauge which clients and
which leads are most qualified for us
services so if somebody travels 50 times
a year they're going to be a lot more
qualified for our services which is
selling travel insurance compared to
somebody that doesn't travel at all so
right after this I've got a function
that says now run the travel frequency
function with the result so I'm going to
go back to functions now and we're going
to have a look at the travel frequency
function so what I did on vapy is I went
and created a new function and this
function I simply just named travel
frequency and I just typed in the
description this is how frequent the
user travels then below this I've got
our property and the property is the
exact bit of data that we're going to be
sending into our sort of lead software
or Google Sheets or whatever we're using
to store all this data we then going to
be capturing that exact amount of times
they travel per year in a number and
then we're sending that off to make.com
so I've just said here per year cuz we
want to capture how many times they
travel per year and I've just said this
is how frequently they travel per year
and I've gone ahead and select a number
cuz it's going to be a number that we're
capturing then once we've run that
function we'll continue on by saying
that's awesome we've got a new service
uh that provides travel insurance for
onetime fee is this something that would
be interested in how much is it we go
down into asking them if they want to be
on our weit list for it and then we've
got another function that just says
interest level and interest level is
just another function we've set up to
capture whether or not they're
interested and this is either yes or no
they're either interested or they're not
and so we just captured in here this
function will store if the user is
interested in our services we've got a
property that says yes or no either yes
or no if the user is interested in our
services and I've selected a Boolean and
so this is a true or false that's what
that means
um and so this is capturing either true
or false from the user and then we're
going to go ahead and then send that
data obviously back into our lead
software and then once that's complete
the script is completely done and we've
captured all the data that we're looking
for and the call is now finished and
then conversely if they were not
interested and we ask them how often
they travel maybe we can capture that
data but if we don't um then it won't
capture anything obviously but if we
continue on we can ask them if they're
interested at all and if they say no it
will just say no worries have a nice day
uh and then obviously it's then going to
record the function result as being uh
not interested and just lastly for the
prompting we've got notes and notes are
just sort of conditions that we want to
throw in uh just to fix little errors
here and there so just saying please
ensure you follow the script closely so
making sure that it actually follows the
script um exactly that's what we want
then if a customer asks a question
deviating from the script uh still
answer that question accurately don't
just continue the script uh like a like
a robot then I've got some critical
notes which are bit stricter than the
other notes and I'm just saying you must
keep the arm within the script this is
used for creating realistic pauses and
assists in your ability to to convince
people to purchase out services so just
adding in this extra conditioning to
make sure it actually says uh or keeps
the arm during the prompt as I found
sometimes it would just leave it out so
it's really quite a lot of trial and
error and this is what's required to
actually get that really perfect prompt
is that you've just got to continuously
test this uh and call it a million times
and then just change this prompt over
and over again uh to really just hone in
on really getting an accurate and
realistic sounding Voice Assistant if
you did want to get access to this
entire prompt I'm going to have it
within my free res Hub Link in the
description which has also got 20 other
trap and automation templates that you
can get as well so moving on to make.com
make is an automations platform that
allows us to send data from different
applications uh and in this case send
data from vapy on our caller and send
some data directly into Google Sheets
and so in this instance we've gone ahead
and created a mac.com scenario that uses
a web hook a web Hook is sort of this
sort of public URL that we can send
information to and we can use it to
detect that we've got a request here on
make so if I go back to VY we've got our
interest level and what it allows us to
do is put in a server URL which is a web
hook URL if I go into my web hook here
on me.com if we create a web hook we can
just create this sort of URL here click
copy address to clipboard go back to
vapy and just paste it in here and now
when we make a request uh with this
interest level when the prompt finds
that it needs to run this it will then
trigger this automation sending the data
through mach.com and then recording the
data in Google Sheets so this is what my
Google sheet looks like it essentially
has a number for the phone number of the
user we're calling it's got a name it's
got an interest level that's been
recorded through VY travel frequency
which has been recorded through vapy as
well as the assistant ID so the number
and name is information that you've got
to go ahead and upload yourself into the
system as this is then going to
obviously call all of the leads that you
upload uh into this Google sheet here so
obviously you don't have to use Google
Sheets you can use air table you can use
go high level you can use any CRM system
that you have but obviously just for
this demo I have configured it in Google
Sheets But ultimately you would just
Swap this out for being ever provider
you have it's quite simple to set up
it's a drag and drop no code platform
where essentially you can just click on
ADD find any platform that you have drag
it in here and then simply just add some
data into a Google sheet row select your
exact uh spreadsheet take the data from
vapy place it in there and you're good
to go so more specifically what this
does is that this first Google Sheets
block searches rows and the reason it
searching for Rose is it's trying to
find the number that has just been
called and the information of where to
actually put it so we've got here number
so it's looking at the number column
within our spreadsheet it's going ahead
and looking through the numbers
obviously I've only got just me in here
at the moment but if you went ahead and
had thousands of leads in here it would
then find the number that you were
looking for so number if it's equal to
the number has just called us or send
the data from vapy grab that row and
then go ahead and send data into that
row so this next block is update a row
and then what we're doing is just
grabbing the row number that we've found
to be relevant to the caller and and
then all we're doing is inputting the
interest level travel frequency and
assistant ID that comes from VY so if
we've made the call and it's gone ahead
and had an interest level it's had a
travel frequency we're going to see
these functions come through from vapy
so when we go to functions interest
level we can see here I've got my
property that says yes no and if I just
go back to make.com we can see here yes
no that is the parameter that the bit of
data is going to be stored in and if I
go back to vapi and have a look at the
travel frequency per year that's the per
year is what's being stored um with the
amount of times they travel per year and
if I go back here per year so this is
information that comes through the web
Hook from vapy and we can send directly
into our Google sheet and add the
corresponding values for each lead in
Google Sheets now the next make
automation here is going to be the most
important part of this entire system
which goes ahead and looks through all
of our leads that are going to be in our
Google sheet whatever platform CRM that
we're using it's going to go ahead and
look through all of these leads and then
it's going to go and iterate at through
each of them and it's going to call each
of them using two different assistants
now the reason that I'm randomly calling
on two different assistants is that I'm
actually going to be tracking which
assistant is making which call using the
assistant ID and the reason that I'm
doing this is to set two different Sal
scripts per assistant and we're going to
run this randomly sort of 50/50 split
test between the two different assistant
Sal scripts and this data is going to be
recorded in our spreadsheet and we're
going to be able to understand which
cell script is more effective and
converting each of these leads into
sales for the business the first module
that I'm using here is the Google Sheets
search rows and it does exactly what it
says it just searches through all of the
rows within a Google sheet and it pulls
back the data at the moment I've got it
set to a 100 at Max but we could
increase this uh as many as we like but
ultimately it will just pull through a
certain amount of leads from our lead
list and then it's going to go ahead and
then pull through and run each row at a
time the next module I have here is an
array aggregator now the purpose of an
array aggregator is to essentially help
in iterating through each row so rather
than pulling back all of these rows in
one big chunk we want to take that big
chunk and then turn it into one run at a
time so we can actually run each call
separately and individually to each lead
so all we need to do is add this array
aggregator just select the values that
we want so we want the row number number
name interest level uh and that's all
the values that we want clicking okay
and then adding in an iterator function
on Mac now the purpose of this iterator
is that then to iterate through one by
one everything in this array so by just
putting in an iterator module and then
clicking on the array right here array
we have over it we can see that it's an
array putting that in here it's then
going to iterate through each row of our
spreadsheet into our vapy calls moving
on to the next module we've got a router
and a router routes down two different
paths depending on some set of
conditions so I've just added in another
module here but I'll get back to that in
just a second so right after our router
the purpose of this router is to go down
a different path based on a set
condition and so in this little sort of
line here and we click on this we can
actually set a condition and if this
condition is met it will go down this
path so in this case I've said if this
random number that I've generated in the
tool but I'll just come back to that is
less than 0.5 it should run and in this
case I've said if this random number is
greater than 0.5 it should run and so
the purpose of this tools function is to
create a variable called random number
and assign random which is a variable
that is stored within mac.com so if we
just click on the text here and type in
random we can get this variable called
random which is a floating point which
is a random number between 0 and 1 so
this is just going to be a random number
that could be between 0 all the way up
into one and so what I've gone ahead and
said is if it's between 0 and .5 or it's
between .5 and 1 they are the two
different areas that we're going to run
down this way we can split our voice
assistants into 50/50 by essentially
randomly setting a variable and then
going down a different condition based
on the variable that has been set so
depending on which whichever one it
actually goes ahead and runs it's then
going to run a HTTP request and so what
this module is doing is making the vapy
phone call through an apri request we
can actually request to vappy to make a
call to a particular phone number using
all the prompts and using all the
functions that we have set up on vapy we
can make a call through mac.com to
actually initiate uh a call to a
particular phone number that we choose
so if you did want to go ahead and copy
this make automation as well as my other
make Automation and the prompt as well
you can go ahead and sign off my free
res Hub Link in the description where
you can get access to all of this for
completely free so to make this request
I've gone ahead and put in the vapy
phone call URL which is https api. vy.
/all /phone so this is something that
you can find within the VY API
documentation you can find a whole heap
on how to make requests to rappy But
ultimately you can go ahead and actually
just copy this from my resource Hub uh
and then just use that from here but
essentially how this works is that we
make the request through rappy we're
doing a post request cuz we're going to
sending data off to vapy to make our
call for us we're just posting that data
off using a post so just below this
we've got our authorization and this
authorization is just an API key to
authenticate that we're allowed to be
making these calls so just going back to
VY we can get this key by going down to
our account and then just clicking on
API key and just hitting the copy button
taking that back typing beer and then
just hitting space and then pasting our
key in here and then we should be
authenticated to make these requests
then below this we've got our content
type application SL Json so just typing
that in as a header and that in as the
value then below this we've got our
actual Json request so we're actually
going ahead and typing in all of the
values similar to how it looked on the
VAP user interface but we're just going
ahead and typing this manually uh using
some Json so it's just doing all the
same stuff with our function here we've
got our function with the yes no
property description it's if the user is
in Services type Boolean so this is just
structured and I've copy and pasted this
from the VAP documentation so you can go
ahead and just copy this as well and
paste it and configure it to be exactly
how you want it to be but scrolling down
further we've got our content as well
which is this content is our
instructions and I've gone ahead and
just copy pasted my entire prompt uh
into this and it's going to go ahead and
just use this exactly how it has on the
user interface but we're just making
this request uh through ma.com obviously
now one thing that we can do now as well
is obviously use the dynamic names from
our lead list here to actually say hey
is this Brendan or hey is this John
whoever the actual lead is we've gone
ahead and put first message hey is this
name and this name has come from uh this
iterator which has ultimately come from
Google Sheets so it now knows that this
particular call by just going to the
iterator here and just selecting name
which the value here in this test was
Brendan it knows the exact name of the
user that we're calling and it's just
going to say what their name is and it's
going to actually know a bit about that
person so scrolling down a bit further
we've got the customer information which
is a name and number which allows us to
put in just putting in the name from the
Excel sheet as well as the number cuz
obviously it needs to know which number
uh to actually go ahead and call so once
again you can go ahead and just copy
this entire Json script from my free
resource Hub and just configure it to
however you'd like and just putting in
all those values simply just read some
of the headings that are here and just
fill in the blanks with everything you
need you can see here I've got my
function with the server URL which is
the uh mate.com web hook to my
spreadsheet data so it's all very
similar to how it was done on the vapy
interface so what I've gone ahead and
done on the vapy interface here is I've
gone and clicked this button to D
duplicate my voice assistant and now
I've got a second voice caller here I'm
going to take the assistant ID here and
just update this one up here and so now
this assistant here is going to be a
different assistant that makes these
calls so that when we track this data in
the spreadsheet we're actually going to
get two completely different assistant
IDs so we can track which caller is
making which calls and what the
conversion rates of each caller are so
I've just gone ahead and added in some
fake data here to demonstrate exactly
what this would look like if we were to
actually scale this system into a bunch
of phone numbers and then just call up a
bunch of people and then get some data
back from these people so in this
instance we've captured the travel
frequency as well as the assistant ID as
well as the interest level of that
particular lead so in this case for
travel insurance what they're looking
for are people that are actually
interested in their services of course
but also looking at the travel frequency
and finding who has the highest amount
of travel frequency and then going ahead
and actually selling the services to
those people CU they are the most
qualified for their services and so
obviously being able to capture that
data at scale to thousands and thousands
of people quite quick quickly and
capturing all of this data really gives
great insights to that travel insurance
place because now they know that they've
got a certain amount of leads that
travel and incredible amount of time and
they can sell their services to them
quite easily so something that we can
now do with this data is actually graph
this data so we can actually visually
see which assistant performed better
than the other and then choose that
assistant to be the one that we actually
want to run and scale on from here so
I've just gone ahead and filtered all of
the interest levels to find all of the
ones that were true so I'm just going to
select this column here go to insert
chart and then what I can get is a pie
chart right here so this graph shows
that of all the people that converted on
our calls 52% came from this caller and
only 47% came from this caller so by
understanding this information we're
able to now pinpoint the exact sales
script that is best working for our
outbound caller so in this case we would
go ahead and choose the blue one which
is the F6 assistant so if we made to
vapy I can see here that this one is the
F6 assistant and so you would obviously
just go ahead and choose this one as
being the C script that works the best
for our leads so this whole optimization
service here is an incredibly valuable
service that you could offer to
businesses to go ahead and actually
optimize with not just two sales scripts
but you could do five or 10 different
Sal scripts that you craft and really
pinpoint the exact Sal scripts and areas
of the script that need to be improved
to create the best sales caller that
gets the most conversions possible for
the business once again if you want to
get access to all of the make templates
and prompts used in this video you can
go ahead and sign up for my free
resource Hub Link in the description
I've also got 20 other chatbot and
automation templates in included in my
resource Hub you can go ahead and
download for completely
free so to get started I'm going to work
on the inbound diversion system so once
again the purpose of this assistant is
to divert the caller to the right
department so if I had a particular
problem with a product that I just
bought and I called up this number and
said that the product was broken it
might divert me to the technical team to
go ahead and fix the product but if I
went ahead and called them and asked
that I would like to purchase one of
their products it may go ahead and
divert me to the s department so to give
you an even better idea I'm just going
to show you the demo of the system
working hi thank you for calling Apple
please let me know what you are looking
for and I will forward this call to the
corresponding
Department hey I'm looking to buy the
iPad
5 great we'd be more than happy to
assist you with your purchase can I
please have your name
John thank you John I am now forwarding
your call to our sales team who will
assist you further with purchasing the
iPad
5 hi is this John yeah this is
John hi John it looks like you were
interested in an iPad 5 is that correct
yeah that's right so as you can see
there we were able to call up this
assistant give it our particular problem
it identified that we're were looking
for a sales department and then it went
ahead and called us from the sales
department we can pick up and then start
talking with the sales guys so in this
case I'm forwarding the calls to a
another AI so we have a sort of multi-
aai agent system going on but obviously
you can also just forward the call to an
actual number if you don't want that
sort of secondary AI step but jumping
right into it I'm just going to briefly
go over vapy which vapy is the AI caller
platform that allows us to build most of
this system so right here on vapy we
have a set of instructions that teaches
the AI on how to respond then we've got
a voice tab which I've got selected at
11 Labs so if you're familiar with any
of the AI voice stuff 11 Labs is one of
the most advanced platforms that allows
us to create really realistic sounding
voices but obviously you can choose
whichever platform you'd like but I've
gone ahead and selected a love labs and
added a custom voice and next to this we
have functions and functions are what
are going to allow us to make these
transferring calls I'll come back to
these functions in just a minute and now
I'm just going to explain to you how
I've engineered The Prompt for this
particular assistant so here on vapy we
get two sort of boxes in our sort of
instruction settings one is a first
message and the first message is simply
the first thing that the assistant says
when you call it so in this case I've
said hi Thank you for calling Apple
please let me know what you're looking
for and I'll fold this call to the
corresponding department so for this
particular example I've just chosen
Apple but obviously you can choose
whatever you'd like or integrate it into
your own business then below this first
message we have a system prompt and a
system prompt is more of the heavy
instructions that actually teaches the
assistant how to respond how to act and
really let it know who it is so the
first thing in my system prompt I'm
stating the role and the role is who the
assistant is so who they are and in this
case I've said you are an experienced
help desk assistant for the technology
company Apple Your Role is to divert
calls to the relevant departments
depending on the customer's query so by
just going ahead and stating directly to
the assistant who they are and exactly
what their role is it's going to Now
understand how to tackle all the
questions that come its way scrolling
down a bit more I have a specific task
so the task is what they actually have
to do so what does the assistant
actually have to do to achieve their
role which is ultimately diverting calls
to the relevant departments and in this
case the task is to converse with the
customer need to find out which of these
departments best suits their needs and
in this case I've set a technical
department sales department or disputes
Department if you are looking for a
custom system just like this you can go
ahead and book a call with my team using
the calendar Link in the description
we've helped several businesses
integrate the solutions that you've seen
here on the channel and we'd be more
than happy to help you out and then I
have specifics so this is actually how
they do it so how do they actually
achieve this task that we've set out and
this is just saying you are a highly
intelligent classifier you'll be able to
tell if a particular customer needs the
technical team for product support the
Sals team to purchase a product or the
dispute team to return the item receive
a refund Etc you must closely follow the
scripts provided for each department and
these specifics are very important to my
career please follow these your ability
to accurately classify the right
Department deeply helps the business
make a profit so you're probably
wondering why I added this in here and
the only reason I've added this in here
is to do with something called emotional
prompting and emotional prompting really
just helps emphasize the importance of
this part of the prompt by saying that
it's very important to my career and
that it's critical for the business's
profit the prompting and the agent will
just look at this and give it a bit of a
high ranking in terms of its importance
and then really try to focus in on and
really work with what you've said now
just beneath this I've got context and
context is actually just giving the AI a
bit more context as to who they actually
are and so in this case I've given
context to the business and what we
actually do now you'll notice that I've
got this sort of hashtag here and this
double hashtag here as well and the
reason I've done this is this is called
markdown formatting and markdown
formatting is really just communicating
to the AI different sections and
importance levels during the prompt and
this is something that open AI
themselves actually trained their models
on so this is just a really good thing
to get into where we're adding in these
subsections which really just
communicates to the AI what is part of
what and really just helps give it even
more context as to the prompt we've
given it so in this case we've got
context which is the main hitting and
then we've got the business which is the
sort of subheading and within this we've
got we are Apple Inc and we provide
technology products to the world for
example the iPhone and iPad now
obviously for your actual business you
might need to provide a little bit more
detail but in this case I'm sort of just
betting on the fact that knows what
apple is through its basic training data
then below this we've got what we do and
so this is once again double hashtagged
and we're just saying we help people
connect digitally with worldclass
devices I've just made that up but
obviously you can add whatever you want
uh for your particular business and this
is really just going to help it get an
understanding of who they are what their
purpose is and why they're doing what
they're doing and really emphasizing the
importance on what they're doing as well
then below this we have one of the most
important parts of the actual prompt
which is examples and so we need to
provide examples to the bot so it
actually understands what it needs to do
and it doesn't just ramble on some
random thing that isn't right relevant
to what we're trying to do so once again
I've got our main heading of examples
and I've got the subheading that says
sales department script and so I've got
several different scripts for each of
the different versions or variants of
conversations that could occur so in
this case I've got a sales department
script below this I've got a sales
department script version two so if
something different happens I've just
gone ahead and given it some sort of a
sort of instructions and a pathway to
take uh if something else happens below
this I've got a technical department
script as well as a dispute Department
script as well so the way that I've
structured the sales department script
I've just said you and so you is the
assistant cuz we're talking to the
assistant here I've saying you should
say hi thank you for calling Apple uh so
this is really just the first message so
we're just emphasizing uh the first
message that it just said so it stays on
track and then we're saying if the
customer says hi I'm interested in
purchasing an iPhone 15 we should then
say great we'd be more than happy to
assist you in this can I please have
your name and then I will fold this call
to our sales team so for this particular
assistant I'm looking for two different
values I'm looking for the product that
they're interested in purchasing so the
iPhone 15 and I'm also looking for their
name and so you'll notice just below
this I've got a function call and the
function call it says once the customer
name and product name is collected run
the sales function so now I'm going to
go back to functions if I just click on
functions and then we've got our sales
function when something specific occurs
during the conversation we can have a
particular action run and in this case
I've gone ahead and said when the call
needs to be forwarded to the sales team
run the sales function so the prompt we
gave it will understand this and during
the call automatically start to run this
function uh because it's now met that
criteria now below this we have two two
different properties one is name and one
is product and so like we said during
that prompt we've got the name so that's
the name of the customer and we've also
got the name of the product so once it's
got these required values it's going to
go ahead and send a request to make.com
so this right here is make.com make.com
is an automations platform that allows
us to communicate information from one
platform to the other and so in this
case we're able to take vapy and send a
request to a sort of URL this URL is
then able to send a bit of information
over to a request block and then this
request block can then send some more
information off to vapy which is another
phone call which is going to call our
customer or our person on the phone and
that is going to be the sales department
now talking to them so very simply all
I've done is created a new make scenario
I've added in this web hook block and
this web hook block has given me a URL
I've gone ahead and copied this URL
added it to our server URL function and
then all this does is it then runs off
to a HTTP request and so this request
block simply makes a phone call from
your vapy account and goes ahead and
just calls the number uh that came
through on the web hook and so if I just
scroll down a bit in this request block
we've got a bit of Json here which just
is structuring the exact assistant that
we're going to be calling with so this
Json here you can get from the vapy
documentation which I will have Linked
In the description but I'm also going to
have this template within my free
resource Hub Linked In the description
my resource Hub also has 20 other
chatbot and automation templates which
you can use and play around with for
completely free so very similar to what
we had just before we've got the role
and we've got who they are and we've got
the specifics and it's really just the
exact same script and then we've also
gone ahead and added in some dnam
Dynamic variables that came in from the
web hook so what we're able to do is by
making this call Via a request we're
able to import their name as well as the
product that they were interested in and
actually communicate this back to them
so if in the first call they said that
their name was Brendan and they were
interested in the iPhone 15 that call
that gets then sent to them is going to
say hey are you Brendan and are you
interested in the iPhone 15 so all we
need to do is then send a request to
make.com to get these variables
populated in make and then we can simply
find these variables in here and you can
see here parameters name and product so
this has come directly from vapy in
those parameters and it just says name
so we just click on name in this case an
example that I sent through was named
John so we can just put Hi and then in
the actual call it will say hi John are
you interested in the iPhone 15 the vapy
request will also give us the phone
number and this is all information
coming from the web hook so make sure to
just run this once to get all that
information through and then you can
just populate all these fields with the
corresponding values I've also created
another variation of the sales
department script which if they just go
ahead and say interested in buying
something we need then offer uh some of
the products we offer so I've just said
great are you looking for an iPhone iPad
or laptop and if they say they're
looking for an iPad then great we've
captured that information uh but if they
haven't said that name we'll just ask
them for their name and then we'll
forward that call and then make this
request with the function call sending
all this data off to make to then send
them that new call with the sales call
populated with all their new values now
just below this we've also got the
technical department script as well as
the dispute Department script which are
once again very similar just being
relevant to the their actual departments
so in this case it's saying hi thank you
for calling Apple uh like that first one
hi my iPad has stopped charging recently
I'm not sure what to do it will just say
we're sorry to hear about that could I
get your name and then we'll forward
your call and then once again the
dispute Department my Apple watch was
meant to be delivered it's not here uh
sorry to hear that we'll then forward
your call to our support department to
get this ordered so obviously these
scripts are very short scripts very
simple to get set up uh but just making
sure they're relevant to the particular
department and then going ahead and
running the relevant function uh and it
will work quite easily so just for this
video I've only set up the sales
department here but obviously the
technical department and dispute
department will be exactly the same just
setting up the function adding in the
make.com UR Ro and then just setting up
the automation to send a call send a
caller assistant that is actually
relevant to them now if I just scroll
down a bit you'll see a forwarding phone
number option and so vapy actually has
an integrated forwarding phone number
system and so simply put all this allows
us to do is just entering our phone
number and then in the prompt say fold
the phone number uh if this occurs and
so obviously this is great and really
simple to use rather than setting up our
own make function but we can only
obviously set one of these at a time uh
so if we want to have multiple
forwarding phone numbers we do just need
to set up a couple of make automations
to make that happen uh but if you are
looking for a little bit of an easier
way to just do one forwarding phone
number you can just type in that number
this is probably a better use case for
more of a human handoff system where if
somebody says that they' like to speak
with a human or it identifies that the
customer seems a bit angry we can go
ahead and then trigger the folding call
uh to a particular number and in this
case have the human now start that
conversation just quickly if you want to
see more AI voice caller videos just
like this let me know what you want to
see in the comments below so now jumping
into the second inbound phone caller
system we've got a contact form where a
customer or a lead can come through type
in their name email address phone number
as well as a message and they're going
to get called in 5 minutes from an AI
phone caller and it's going to help
qualify them as a lead or even book an
appointment if you want to so this is
going to be a super intelligent
assistant that not only knows what its
name is but it's actually going to
understand the message and the context
of that message so if I take the Apple
sales caller for example if they typed
they wanted an iPhone 15 in the message
box when they get CAU up it's going to
know obviously that they wanted to buy
an iPhone 15 and really tailor that
conversation to that so for this
particular example I'm using webflow for
my form submission but you could use any
website provider or form provider that
you use and then all you got to do is
swap out the make block that I'm using
I'm just using a webflow block that
watches for any form submissions you
would simply just swap that out for
whatever provider you have have and then
continue on the automation which would
be exactly the same so if you are
following along with webflow all you
need to do is just Chuck in a form block
add in some values for a name email
address phone number and message and
then we're going to use these values
when a make request is made so jumping
into make.com right here I've got a
webflow watch events and this just
watches for any form submissions that
occur on the website so in the case of
my website this form is called voice
call and so all I want to do is just
ensure that we're getting the calls from
the right form so what I have is a
filter on my mag Auto that just checks
if the form is coming from the right one
I'm just saying if the name of the form
is equal to voice call which is my form
name then continue the automation so
once this automation has gone through
we've now populated all of the values
from webflow and we're now moving on to
a sleep tool so in make.com we're able
to actually put in a slip tool that
simply just Waits and delays the
automation before continuing on to other
steps in this case I've got it set to 15
seconds just for testing but we could
put this all the way up to 300 seconds
which is 5 minutes and that is going to
give us enough time to make it sound a
bit more realistic uh that the business
has called them 5 minutes after they've
gone ahead and submitted that contact
form so once the automation has waited
for the Sleep block we're just moving on
to another request block which is
exactly the same as the one before where
we're making the API call to vappy to
make a phone call and then send that
phone call to the number that came
through from the webflow request so all
I've done is run the webflow request and
this has allowed me to populate a bunch
of fields here and so what I've done is
populated the name and the message
within this prompt and so just within
the specific spot of my prompt you can
see specifics I've added in another
thing that says please refer to the
customer's message when starting the
conversation and then I've done message
column and then I've got the message
that came directly from webflow and so
by doing this we're able to give it a
little bit more context as to what the
conversation should be about if it's
going to be a sales score what are we
actually selling and if we already have
that information like the iPhone 15
obviously we want that information to be
there in the conversation to give it a
little bit more context about what we're
doing and so once that is set up we're
simply able to go ahead and just fill
out this contact form hit the the submit
button and have them make automation run
sending a call to the particular phone
number that was inputed in the form
calling us and then qualifying us
whatever we like if you are looking for
a custom system just like this you can
go ahead and book a call with my team
using the calendar Link in the
