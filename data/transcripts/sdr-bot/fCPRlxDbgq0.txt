all right two things yes I really do
have a BMW with the tag AI pays and the
second thing is I hate wasting time so
I'm going to give you these time stamps
here uh for you to go through the video
to find what you're interested in in
deploying wh labeled AI voice into go
high level uh this was something I sent
out to our users for an update for a new
voice engine that allows for inbound
calling outbound calling as well as web
calling uh through iframes on your
funnel so there's a no obligation way
for for them to call and collect
information it's a great prospecting
Tool uh but enough talking again I don't
like to waste time let's just get right
into it all right AI voice calling
assistance update this is the perfect
add-on to the chat assistants that
operate in SMS gmbb IG Facebook WhatsApp
all the native channels in high level
now we can Encompass voice with that too
so with this update comes a few uh new
features in here a new assistant type
and even a new deployment type to be
able to get that assistant out into the
wild to to call your leads and uh even
use iframes as lead magnets so let's
just get started here uh we'll start in
phone numberers so this is a new tab
where you able to buy a phone number
directly through twilio uh through us
you put in your area code we'll purchase
the number for you and then assign that
to your account if you are outside of
the US and Canada you can import a
number if you already have a twilio
number yourself or you go get a twilio
number and import it through us um if
you're outside of the US and Canada if
you are inside the US and Canada you can
just buy a number here once you buy a
number uh you could buy as many as you
want there's no limits on it you'll have
this number in your account you can
assign it to a voice assistant once you
have it created we'll come back here uh
just know that we have phone numbers and
you need a phone number for a uh
assistant to be able to call so now
under assistance we have a new assistant
type uh we have chat and we have voice
so we walk into new assistants and then
we see now multi Channel voice here when
we click on that we get a new voice
assistant um walking into that I'll go
to the one I already have built out so
we're able to really really really
granularly manage these voice assistants
to be as robust as possible rather than
just a llm chatting back and forth with
leads and uh not really actionably doing
anything and and not being super
customizable so uh we start in the
configure tab here where we can give it
a name uh we can select a voice from The
Suite of voices and this will expand and
then we can select any of these
languages here that we operate in for
ICP um our ideal customer profile and
then we'll have um an outbound number
which will be the phone number we have
here so this is if we're calling to the
assistant to make an outbound call what
number are they going to use we assign
it there and then transfer number this
is pulled automatically from your
sublocation once you create a voice
assistant but we're able to change that
down here we just edit and then you can
choose your country code put in the
transfer number and save there okay um
and then once you have a phone number if
this is the one that you want uh you
know to be assigned to that phone number
four outbound uh you assign the number
here save it and you're good to go next
we go to Advanced if you in the medical
space or Hippa uh Hippa compliance is
something that is a concern for you and
your clients we do have Hippa compliance
with these voice assistants so what this
will what this will do is when this is
enabled no logs no recordings no
transcripts will be stored all of that
data will just be uh summarized for you
in a call log and just saying that there
was a call made to this number from this
number um just with an analysis over it
um we have recording enabled and of
course you know when hip is on that
cannot be off um silence timeout so what
this is going to be is how many seconds
of Silence does the assistant wait
before ending the call on its own in a
situation where someone may be playing
with your AI uh you may be getting
ghosted someone who's not interested
after uh however many determined seconds
the assistant will just automatically
end the call response delay is the same
thing uh response uh delay as far as the
voice engine response delay as far as
the llm you're able to customize that a
little bit more obviously latency is
going to be most important for people so
we're just going to keep that low so the
number of words to interrupt the
assistant so we're able to granular
manage how many words it takes for the
assistant to realize that there's been
an interruption and for it to stop
talking now caveat to that words like
stop actually know anything that shows
negative intent will automatically stop
the assistant from speaking but you're
able to adjust it for just plain
conversation uh you know from one word
to as many as you'd like and then
maximum duration uh if you don't want
you know people who who may be um um may
be malicious with your AI you know
running the call too long or your
assistant's just taking a long time with
you know lead client whatever it is we
can limit that time to a specific
duration after that duration the
assistant will say thank you have a nice
day and then hang up so we're not eating
into our minutes here and then we have a
voicemail message if it goes to
voicemail this is what it'll say and
then in call message so the message that
the assistant will say if it needs to
end the call next we go to Voice um so
along with the voice that we selected in
the configure tab we can also add
background music or not so it's not just
an assistant in the void whether we're
calling inbound outbound on the phone or
it's a web deployment via iframe we can
add some background sound here to uh you
know make it seem a little bit more
realistic like a like a human talking to
someone it's actually very fun uh when I
when I test and when I talk to this and
you asking a question uh and the
assistant's like what's your email and
then you give it the email and then you
just hear ambient typing noises it makes
it seem very humanlike it's very great
um voice model if you are um working in
a language that is non-english choose
the multilingual if not uh choose turbo
for this and then we're able to add
ility Clarity and similarity style
exaggeration and then we can optimize
for latency all here for the voice
granularly managing that we run into
prompt we have a greeting message this
is the opening message The Prompt that
goes along with this the temperature max
tokens and models this model will be
cheaper this model will be better this
kind of limits how much the assistant is
going to talk when it's its turn in the
conversation and then temperature
controls the randomness so the higher
the temperature the more random the
lower the temperature the more
deterministic it is going to be so
that's prompting pretty easy we hand you
all this stuff as soon as you create
your voice assistant you'll see
something very very similar to this you
just fill in the blanks and you're good
to go lastly is the log so you'll see
all the calls that come through how much
they cost and the average talk time for
all of it as well as a recording you can
download the recording or read the full
transcript um so able to granularly um
you know manage your log see everything
that's going on and any actions taken
and summaries that'll be uh that'll come
off of these calls as well so up top we
just see a breakdown of cost for web and
phone it's actually significantly
cheaper than that but it's just an
estimate just in case latency or you
know llm costs are high at that point
but um that's the assistant uh The Voice
Assistant type now how do we get this
thing out into the while so um we've
seen outbound number here so we'll get
to that in a minute but if we want that
assistant to take an inbound call to
this number that we have purchased here
we go to the number and then we can add
our voice assistant here update the
information and then whenever this
number is called this assistant will
pick up as the inbound assistant for
this number um the reason that it is
divvied out from inbound and outbound
just adds a little bit more granular uh
granular management of client
acquisition and the grander scheme of
actually deploying these things so we
may have one assistant calling out and
then when someone calls back to that
number maybe it was a voicemail they get
another assistant that is is relevant
for inbound calls rather than outbound
um so you're able to dynamically kind of
play with how these assistants walk and
talk uh things like that so this is
inbound all you have to do is just link
the assistant to the number here when
this number's called that assistant will
answer all right after inbound we have
outbound so when we go to the assistant
type we can select our outbound number
from our list of numbers this is the
number that the when this is called to
Via the rest API or the workflow action
this is the number that this assistant
will use when it's making an outbound
call so right now until the workflow
actions get approved we're running with
ar rest API in which we have the
snapshot for it's going to be included
in the description and in the admin
portal um inside of resources so we'll
go ahead and Link this number up here
there's one thing we need to do we need
to go to our admin portal here we need
to go to our settings Integrations and
then let's go ahead and generate an
agent Centric secret key so this is
going to be a API key through agent
Centric to call to our rest API to make
outbound calls not only from high level
right but from any platform that we're
operating in um to be able to make these
calls via our assistant inside of high
level so this will be our key and of
course I'm going to delete this key
right after but uh don't share this key
with anybody this acts as your API
secret key all right um it's just a web
hook uh a post request to the make call
endpoint the authorization is your API
key that we generated here in the admin
portal and then we need the assistants
ID which is right here we'll just copy
that and then you just throw that in
here and then we'll just Link contact
number to to contact number raw cuz it
needs to have the uh you know like
instead of 770 it'll be plus 1770 and
then location ID is location ID and then
contact name is contact name super super
simple we have the snapshot in the
description for you uh for this actual
web hook so you really don't have to do
anything just run a lead through your uh
through your outbound call after you've
assigned all the numbers there so that's
how you make an outbound call so now all
you have to do is once you have this
workflow set up you just run your
context to this workflow it will ceue up
uh calling these these um these contacts
based on all the information we were
given and then you'll see the logs after
the conversations have been completed
and the uh the actions or um outcome of
those calls in your logs here for that
assistant so that is inbound that is
outbound last is iframes so this is web
calling so uh we have a new deployment
type so rather than deploying inside of
the CRM here will deploy inside of a
widget for this initial release we have
the the voice orb so you click on this
let's go ahead and choose Haley our
assistant let's assign Haley to this
assistant great um now I have an
embedded iframe code I copy this code
and then I can put this inside of my
website you see it has my wh label
domain here um so if you're worried
about a white label client saying oh is
Agent Centric domain going to be in
there no as long as you have your wh
labeled uh domain set up in the admin
portal your iframe code here will have
your stuff in it and point all to the
right place and it'll look exactly like
this right here so you just copy the
code all right and then we'll go into
high level all it is is a custom HTML
JavaScript open the code editor throw
that in there and then you can see what
it looks like here this is what it looks
like and then this is what it looks like
on our website so you can see two
different perspectives from a dark
background and a light background so uh
these are really really great because
these are almost no obligation lead
magnets in a way um you know especially
for the agency or maybe even a um you
know the local businesses that you're
serving for someone to call in and talk
to the assistant here live inside of the
browser while it's collecting
information really great lead magnet
here really great like I said you can
put it anywhere not not only for yours
for prospecting and and lead generation
but for your clients as well to be able
to collect uh you know more actionable
uh leads off of the website without them
having to um at least explicitly give
out contact information so hope that's
helpful super exciting we're just
getting started here so much cool stuff
coming up thanks so
[Music]
much
