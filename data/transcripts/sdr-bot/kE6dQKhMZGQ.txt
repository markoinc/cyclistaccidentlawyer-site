# Category: followup

just imagine being able to send every
single one of your leads and Prospects a
unique email followup sequence that
speaks directly to their interests needs
and desires this is where we're going to
set up today and just think about how
much more deals and sales you can
generate when you can create this type
of personalization AI is the technology
that allows us to create these
personalizations at scale and if you're
a business owner you need to be
utilizing this technology
to generate more sales instead of
sending a bland cookie cutter email
template that's the same that goes out
to every single person on your list now
you can send unique emails based on what
you know about that Prospect or lead
you're going to generate so much more
sales when you have a system like this
in place if you're new to my channel hi
my name is Helena and we talk about
everything Ai and automations here so
please make sure you like And subscribe
I would really appreciate that also
we're going to be using a tool called go
high level to set everything up there is
going to be a link below where you can
get a free trial to ghl and additionally
I have a free Ai and automations course
and the link is in the descriptions
below as well if you want to dive more
into this topic and learn more about it
please take my free course with that
being said let's dive in okay so the
first thing that we need to do is
compile all of the information that we
know about our customers or leads this
could be through a opt-in form that you
have on your website surveys that you
send out to your mailing list or
existing information that you already
have about your leads that stored in
your CRM system and once you have
compiled all of this information you
want to put it all into one place so
right now I have all of my information
here stored in this demo Google sheet
and as you can see I have the name email
website and Linkedin and for security
purposes I can only show you my
information but you can imagine this
sheet being hundreds if not thousands of
rows along and once we have all of the
information we have about our leads or
prospects then we're ready to do the
next step which is the personalization
now before we move on I just want to say
that these fields are not the only
fields that you can create
personalizations on for example if you
are running an e-commerce store these
columns could be the products that your
customers have purchased in the past if
you're a personal trainer these columns
could be the starting weight the desired
weight and the reason for wanting to
lose weight in our example here let's
just suppose that we only have the
website and Linkedin of this Prospect
and we're trying to sell this Prospect
AI services and we're going to create a
unique email sequence for every single
person that is on this spreadsheet so
once we have our data the Second Step
would be to create these automated
emotes that's personalized to every
single prospect that is on your sheet
and we're going to use a tool to called
make.com to do this is an automation
tool that allows us to create these AI
personalizations at scale you can get
started for absolutely free and the link
is also in the description below so once
you have signed up for an account you
want to go up here and click on create
new scenario this is going to take you
to a blank canvas make.com is a
completely no code automation tool that
can tell you what the steps of your
automation is in a very visual way so
the first thing is we need to select our
trigger and our trigger in this case
will be Google Sheets depending on how
you want to set up this automation this
trigger could also be the optin form
that you set up on your website so as
soon as someone opts in these customized
emails will be created and the sequence
will be sent out to them at the time
frame that you want it to be sent out
and uh for our example here I'm going to
select watch new row on my Google sheet
and I'm going to select the spreadsheet
that we have just created here okay once
I have selected the spreadsheet that we
have just created I'm going to select
the sheet which is just one sheet on
that whole spreadsheet and I'm going to
change the limit to one and I'm going to
press okay now that I have all of the
information from that row pulled from
Google sheet now I need to write the
customized emails and in our example
let's suppose that we want to send out a
threep part email sequence now we need
to use AI to start writing email 1 email
2 then email 3 you can use any large
language model to create this so you can
use perplexity you can use clod you can
use open Ai and in our example here
we're going to use open AI so I'm going
to search for the open aai module from
the list and I'm going to select open
aai and then I'm going to select create
a completion if this is your first time
connecting your open aai account to
make.com you will need to get your API
key in order to get your API key go to
platform. open.com / api-key and you
will be prompted to enter in your credit
card information before you are able to
generate an API key open AI will charge
you for usage and the price depends on
how much you use currently if you use a
latest model which is GPT 40 it is $5
for 1 million tokens of input or $15
for1 million tokens of output and one
token equals roughly four to five
characters and once you get your open AI
API key from the website you would just
press add here put in your key and you
are all good to go I have already done
so now once you have your key entered
you're ready for the next step in the
model I'm going to select the latest
model which is GPT 40 and you want to
use GPT 40 especially if you are
personalizing based on a link such as
website or LinkedIn URL because GPT 40
currently is the only model that allows
you to access the web in real time after
I selected my model I'm going to now
select my message for the role I'm going
to select user and for the message
content this is where I put in my prompt
okay I have finished writing my prompt
here and as you can see I told AI that
you are a worldclass emot copywriter and
you're reaching out to different
business owners to see if they are
interested in implementing Ai and
automations in their business then I
told it to write a personalized email to
that business owner based on the
specifics of their business as well as
the industry and background that they
have then I gave AI the information
about their website and Linkedin and I
told it to not write more than three
sentences and end with a call to action
to book a call and you can get this
exact prompt in my school Community the
link is also in the description below as
well okay so after I have written this
email I actually went and tested it just
to make sure it's working and this is
the output right over here you can see
hey Helena I've been following product
Camp's impressive journey and believe Ai
and automation can amplify your
operations and customer experience could
we schedule a quick call to explore how
our services can align with your goals
best wishes Helena so this email is
turning out pretty good I'm pretty happy
with it now I'm ready to move on to step
number two before I do so I'm just going
to rename this email one so that I can
track of which module is which and it
will just make it easier for me to
organize my work as I'm building this
automation so step number two is we now
going to send a follow-up email to this
Prospect if they don't reply and I can
do so by opening up another open AI
module here repeat the same process by
selecting GPT 40 as our model in the
messages I'm going to select user as our
row and here I'm going to put in my
prompt okay so I have put in my prompt
for the second email here I told AI to
reference the first email as well as
take a look at the prospects website and
Linkedin to write this follow-up email
and of course to keep the email no more
than three sentences and have a call to
action at the end of course you can get
this exact prompt in my school Community
below I'm just going to rename this
email to and let's run it and see what
the result is once we do so it's been
about a minute and our automation
finished running so let's take a look at
what email 2 looks like here and as we
can see here the email says I understand
challenges in product management
especially given your impressive
background in scaling Tech Solutions AI
automations can enhance product camps by
reducing manual task and improving
decision-making accuracy empowering your
team to focus on strategy can we please
book a call to discuss further to
improve the results of these emails you
could also get more and more specific
with your prompt you can even give it
specific examples of what you want these
emails to look like so that AI can write
in your tone of voice as well now that
we finish email 2 two let's now repeat
the process and do email 3 okay so I
have repeated the same process that we
used for email 1 and two I selected GPT
40 as a system I selected user as a row
and then I put in my prompt here and I
just told AI this is the final email so
add some urgency to this final email now
and I I told it what I wrote for email 1
and two then I gave it some additional
parameters to keep in mind again you can
get this prompt in my school Community
below I give it the maximum token of
1,000 I'm just going to press okay after
I do so I'm going to save and run it to
see what all three of these emails look
like okay now that we have all of our
customized emails ready we're now ready
to move on to step number three where we
need to get all of these emails into go
high level so that they can be sent out
in an email sequence so to do so the
first thing that we need to do is to
connect to our go highle account we're
going to search for highle lead connect
ctor as our module inside of make and
the next thing is we need to figure out
whether the contact that we are sending
this email to already exist in our CRM
or customer relationship management
system or not so we're going to look for
the search contact module here and we're
going to put in the email address of
this person to see if they already exist
in our go high Lev account so we're
going to input in the email address that
we got from the Google sheet in this
case and again just to reiterate we can
use any kind of optin form as the
trigger here CRM or Google sheet as the
trigger here this whole system is
totally customizable to suit the funnel
that you want to run whether it's a
webinar funnel a book a call funnel a
product funnel this will work for you
okay so once we have our email here I'm
going to limit this to just one result
because I shouldn't have the same email
more than once in my CR M system oh and
if this is your first time connecting to
go high level then click add up here and
you can select the connection type you
want to select o off
2.0 and click save then it's going to
prompt you to sign into your go highle
account and if you don't have one then
simply use the link below to get your
free trial when you use the link below
you will also get a free AI chatbot as
well that you won't get if you use any
other link to get the go High Lev
account now you want to select allow
access to all of your sub accounts and
enable future installations then press
proceed I have already done so so my
account is already connected here and
I'm going to put in the email here again
and put the limit to one now that high
level is searching whether this contact
already exists in my CRM or not the next
thing I want to do is create a router
what the router is going to do is is
basically a creates an IFL statement if
this contact exists then it's going to
take this route if the contact doesn't
exist then it's going to take the
following route so I'm going to actually
click on the gear icon here on the
branch which allows me to actually set
up my condition and set up this filter
I'm going to label this contact exist
because this will allow me to quickly
see what this filter is for this is just
a label for yourself basically and what
I want to say here is whether or not the
email address that was returned from the
search contacts module exist or not so
the condition is if the email address
that we just searched for exists this
means that this contact exists okay and
if this contact exists then what we want
to do is we want to update this contact
with the information that we just
generated to personalize their
experience is if the contact doesn't
exist then we need to create a new
contact and put in all of the
personalization emails that we have just
created now one thing we need to do
before we can do so is actually to log
into your go high level account and it
will look like this you'll get your
dashboard and you want to go down to
settings then scroll down until you see
custom fields and this is where we need
to create three custom fields for email
1 email 2 and email 3 to to do so click
on ADD field here at the top and we want
to select multi-line and press next then
I'm going to call this field email one
and you need to select the group that it
belongs to you can organize your ghl
account however you want to so you can
create as many groups as you want to you
can even create a group just for
personalized emails just to keep all of
these custom fields in organized fashion
I'm going to put it under the additional
information folder in my ghl account and
I'm going to call this field contact one
then I'm going to do the same for email
2 and email 3 okay as you can see here I
have created three Fields one called
email 1 one called email 2 and one
called email 3 now I can go back into
make and send the information that's
supposed to be in email 1 2 and three
back into ghl and attach it to the
appropriate contact so back in make I'm
going to select the highlevel n here and
because this Branch here is for when
contact exists then inside of the highle
module I'm going to select update a
contact and from here I am going to fill
in all of the information about this
contact here because this contact exists
I can get their contact ID from the
search module that we were just in and
all of their name email then in this
case doesn't need to be updated you
could feel free to uh enter it again
again but it will give the same result
what's important here is you scroll down
to the bottom and find the three the
three custom fields that you just
created one for email 1 one for email 2
one for email 3 and by the way even if
you want to customize uh this flow to
just be one custom email or just one
line a custom email you can do so you
can even use this to create 10 different
customized emails so this whole system
is totally flexible so just use the
principles that you learn through this
tutorial to customize it for your
business to suit your funnel okay so
instead of email one we need to input
the outputs that was from chat GPT so
I'm going to select eno1 module from
open aai I'm going to expand on choices
then expand on message and input the
content of email one right inside of the
email one field and I'm going to do the
same for emot to I'm going to expand on
choices I'm going to expand message and
put the content of email 2 inside of the
email 2 field then I'm going to do the
same for email three and this will allow
me to now have customized emails sent
out to all of my Lee I hope you're
seeing where I'm going with this because
this contact already exists this means
that the inside of my ghl account I
already know this person's name email
Etc but it's up to you you could enter
it again it shouldn't make a difference
here so once I'm done I'm just going to
press okay and if the contact does not
exist now we're going to create the
filter for that and we can set up this
filter and we can to call it contact
does not exist and the condition here
would be when we use the search module
from ghl the email address that we
search for does not exist okay and then
we're going to press okay and if the
contact doesn't exist where we're going
to to do is select the highle lead
connector module and we're going to
create a new contact we're going to
select create a new contact and now we
had to fill in all of the information
about this lead so we're going to input
their email which we got from the Google
spreadsheet in this case again you can
use any opt-in form from your website as
well phone number if you have that and
you can fill in their name gender
address website and company name if they
have given to you we have the website
information and what's important is you
want to go down you go down to your
custom fields and fill in what you want
email one to say email two to say email
3 to say okay so again I'm going to go
to the open AI module expand on choices
expand on message and enter in the
content that's supposed to be in email
one I'm going to do the same thing for
email 2 here expand on choices expand on
message put in the content of email 2
and then finally do the same for email 3
expand on choices message and content
and now I'm all ready to go now that the
information is sent back to ghl we need
to create our email automation inside of
go high level so what we need to do is
go into go high level and select on
automations Tab and from here we can
select a brand new automation so click
create workflow and start from scratch
and now we can create our whole
automation here okay once we have
started a new workflow instead of go
high level we'll be taken to a blank
canvas that looks like this and as you
can see it looks somewhat similar to
make.com and all of these automation
tools once you know the basics of it
even if they change the UI you'll still
be able to find your way around it so
the first thing we need to do is set up
our trigger just like in make.com and
then we have to set up the steps of our
automation our trigger here will be when
the email one field of the contact has
been populated so we're going to search
for contact change as our work trigger
here and what's going to change is the
new custom field that we have just
created inside of the filters here I'm
going to search for email one and I'm
going to set the operator to has changed
I'm going to save this trigger so
essentially whenever that field gets
populated that tells ghl that AI has
finished writing the customized
personalized email for that contact and
to start this whole automation here so
once we have our trigger it's time to
now figure out the next actions to do
and we wanted to actually send out that
email so inside of the actions we're
going to select send email and this is
where we can actually put in the
customized email that we had just
written all you need to do is click on
the custom values here search for email
1 which is the field that we just named
and we going to click on email one and
now this contact is going to be send the
personalized email that you have just
written okay after you done this make
sure you save the action at the bottom
and press the plus button here again and
you want to space these three emails out
you can choose how you want to space it
out just look for the wait module here
and you can select whether you want to
wait by a certain number of hours or a
certain number of days if we want to
wait for two days in between the three
emails I'm going to select two days here
save the action and now repeat the same
process for email 2 and email 3 I'm
going to search for send email as the
action here again and in the custom
values now I'm going to search for email
too and now this particular lead will
get a specific email that's written just
for them based on their website and
their LinkedIn profile and again you can
change these fields to be whatever you
want to customize and personalized on
and this whole thing's on Automation and
this lead is going to think you spent
hours drafting a personalized message
just for them you can literally use this
whole system for anything you want from
job hunting to looking for clients to
following up with clients this system is
so robust and I really encourage you to
try this out after I have saved email 2
I'm going to press the plus button again
look for weight and again let's say this
time I want to wait for 20 hours I'm
going to put 20 here select hours and
click save and now I'm ready to send out
my third email I'm going to search for
send email again put in the content from
email 3 here and I'm going to search for
the custom field that we just created
for Emil 3 again save this action and
once everything is done save turn it on
to publish turn this whole automation on
to publish and you are done now you have
a robust
customizable email automated follow-up
system that will send unique emails to
every single one of your leads and
Prospects I guarantee you once you
implement this whole system it will make
you a lot of money if you want me or my
