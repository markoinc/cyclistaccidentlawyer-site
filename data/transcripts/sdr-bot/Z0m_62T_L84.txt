Hey everyone, welcome back to the
channel. In this video, we are going to
connect an AI voice agent built in Voppy
with a GoHigh level setup. If you're new
to the channel, my name is Bogdan and
I've been running an AI automation
agency for the past 2 years. And on this
channel, I share tutorials and insights
from building my AI business. At our
agency, we keep getting clients using
GoHigh Level. And a few times already,
we've had to brainstorm projects where
we had to build an AI voice agent and
plug it into their GHL setup. So, in
this video, I decided to show you how to
do it exactly step by step and hopefully
save you some time. Let me show you a
quick demo.
>> Hey, welcome to Bosar Agency. What can I
help you with?
>> Hey, um I'd like to book an appointment.
>> Sure. May I have your full name and
phone number to proceed?
Yes, my name is David and my phone
number is + 457036514.
Thank you, David. Your contact has been
created successfully. Uh, when would you
like your appointment? Please share your
preferred date and time. Um, can we do
it tomorrow at 3:30 p.m.?
>> The available slots for tomorrow,
September 3rd, include 3:30 p.m. Would
you like to confirm this time?
>> Yep. Yeah, sounds good.
>> Your appointment is confirmed for
tomorrow, September 3rd, at 3:30 p.m.
Thanks.
>> Thank you. Bye-bye. So, that was the
demo. And now if I go to my sub account
in gohi level and click on the calendar
option you will see the tabs here um
calendar view and appointment list view.
So in appointment list view you can see
the booked appointment and on the right
side of every booked appointment I can
click view details and see the details
that were retrieved during the call.
Okay, real quick what is gohigh level
and why do so many businesses use it? In
short, Gohle brings together a bunch of
features that you'd normally need
multiple tools for. It combines your
CRM, email, SMS, funnels, appointment
scheduling, even website and landing
page builders. So instead of juggling
six different subscriptions, everything
lives under one roof. You can set up
automated follow-ups, booking reminders
through SMS, email or voicemail and you
know lead nurturing sequences. This is
what makes scalable outreach possible.
It has calendars with availability
settings and booking widgets that sync
with your Google or Outlook. And what's
really cool about it is the wide
leveling option for agencies. You can
brand the entire platform as your own
and resell it to clients with custom
funnels and workflows. I guess its
biggest advantage is that it
consolidates tools that most businesses
need anyway, but they are all in one
place. All right, so here's the highle
flow of what we are doing today. First
we create a calendar in highle sub
account so that we can get the calendar
ID. This ID we will paste into vap's
builtin highle tools for integration.
Next we will go into vap where we will
set up our voice agent. Then inside vapy
we set up the built-in highle tools and
there are different tools such as get
contact. It pulls lead information if it
already exists in our go high level
account. Create contact. It saves new
leads instantly into goh level if they
don't exist already. Then check
availability. This one checks the
calendar for open slots and create
event. Obviously books the appointment
right inside go high level. And then
we'll just connect the VP assistant
directly to our highle account. Okay. So
step number one is to create a calendar
in the gohigh level sub account. I
already have one. Um you can see it
here. Make sure to set the availability
according to your schedule and you can
also connect it with Google and Outlook
etc. Super important it must be in the
sub account not in the main account.
Okay, because only sub account calendars
are tied to the client's workflows
pipelines and automations. If you create
it in the main account you might break
the integration and appointments won't
trigger the right automations. So always
use sub account calendars. All right.
Step number two is to create an
assistant in Vapim. So in Vapim once
you're logged in the very first thing to
do is create an assistant. Give it a
name something like GHL voice agent.
This assistant is where we attach the
system prompt and connect all our tools.
So this is basically the brain of our
agent. I'm not going to do a tutorial on
Vapi. There are some separate videos on
my channel. So feel free to check them
out. Here we can see the system message
where we have to set the prompt. So,
what I'm going to do is open the GHL
integration section inside Vapis
documentation. This documentation is
fantastic. If you're serious about doing
this, right, I highly recommend that you
go through it carefully. It explains
exactly how the system prompt and tools
should work. So, right here you can see
the system prompt that Vapy recommends.
I'll just copy this one and paste it
directly into my assistant system
prompt. And this is honestly the best
part because you don't have to sit and
engineer a complex prompt yourself. Just
use the one in the docs and everything
will line up perfectly. Okay, step
number three is to set up the tools. So
now I move into the tools tab in Vapi.
Create a tool and if we look below at
the bottom is go high level. If we click
on it, you can see the four tools that
Vapi offers to directly connect with
Gohigh level. Here you can see I already
have the four GHL tools created. But
let's quickly walk through them. Get
contact tool. This checks if a lead
already exists in GoHigh level before
creating a duplicate. Let's open it. And
when you're creating these tools, don't
fill in the description. The system
prompt you pasted already defines what
each tool does. Just make sure the tool
names match exactly with the ones
mentioned in the prompt because that's
what keeps everything aligned. On
metadata, click yes to use customer's
phone so that we can get the phone
number and leave the remaining settings
as default. The next one is create
contact tool. So if the lead doesn't
exist, this saves their details
instantly. Again, follow the
instructions for the name and leave the
description blank. And also make sure to
use customer phones so that we can get
the phone number. The next one is check
availability tool. This is where the AI
can actually look for open slots for
booking appointments. So open it and
paste the calendar ID that you created
in GoHigh level. Just copy it from your
go high level account and paste it here
in the ID section. Time zone is optional
and set everything else as default. And
the last tool is create event tool. This
basically books the appointment on that
exact calendar. So I'll open it and also
paste the calendar ID here. All right.
This method works really well because
with Vapi builtin highle tools, you
don't have to spend time wiring
everything together like we used to do
in n10 or mag.com where we had the
integration separate. These tools do the
heavy lifting automatically. All right.
And the last step is connecting vap with
go level. Now inside vapy I head into
more and then integrations. Here you'll
see two options under go level. the old
API key method and the new marketplace
connect method. So this is way easier
and we are going to use this one. I
click connect and it immediately takes
me to the gole marketplace screen. Now
here you can see vap is requesting from
gohigh level access to write access to
read etc. I just press next here and
instantly my vap account is linked with
gohigh level. That's it. No API keys, no
manual configuration, just a simple
click connection. Now everything is
ready. You can test the agent live. It
pulls contacts, checks availability, and
books appointments directly inside the
GHL calendar in real time. I hope you
found this quick tutorial useful. Please
let me know in the comments which kind
of automation tutorial I should prepare
for you next. Thank you very much for
