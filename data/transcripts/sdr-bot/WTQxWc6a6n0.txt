AI is here in late 2023 go high level
released an update integrating AI into
many of their features including
workflow I like to think there are three
different levels to creating an AI
appointment booking bot in go high level
and I'm going to walk you through step
by step how you can create a booking bot
at level one two or three if you're new
here my name is Connor Alder I'm a
digital marketer and upcoming medical
student at washu I've been using go high
level for about the last 3 years and
recently I decided to start my own
agency selling Facebook ads to mental
health clinics and I use go high Lev
software to do that so first of all the
three levels of AI appointment booking
Bots level one is go high level simple
this is going to be the fastest way to
get your AI appointment booking bot up
and running I'm going to walk you
through that it's pretty quick pretty
easy but not quite as customizable level
two I call go highle workflows this is
all things considered still pretty easy
to set up but it is a little bit more
Hands-On and if you want to really
fine-tune how the bot is going to
respond to specific messages this might
be the level for you but it does take a
little bit more time to build and then
level three is going to be going to a
thirdparty developer someone like zappy
chat or close bot the pro of level three
is that there is a lot of
customizability and it's very user
friendly the con being that it's a
little bit more expensive and you have
to pay for a subscription to get that
software into go high level okay so for
level one we're going to be building the
simple go high Lev bot here we are in
agency View and I'm going to come into
settings and you want to go over to
company and you want to scroll down here
until you get to content Ai and uh
workflow Ai and you want to make sure
those are both toggled on we also have
reviews Ai and conversation AI you
should have all of those toggled on okay
next step is to go into your sub account
all right once we are in our sub account
we're going to go into settings then
we're going to hit conversation AI okay
so once we're in conversation AI
basically what we're going to do is come
here into preferences and go to
autopilot beta this is going to allow
the bot to actually send messages we're
going to choose our supported channel in
this case I'm going to choose just SMS
but you could enable this for Facebook
or Instagram I'm going to scroll down
into advanced settings here this isn't
super necessary I'm going to say Alder
media we got wait time before responding
this is important so that it doesn't
seem like it's just a bot I think about
2 minutes is great maybe 1 minute
maximum messages that a bot can send to
a contact this you probably want to
leave at 10 this just means that if they
send 10 messages and they're still
asking questions then it's not going to
keep responding which is probably good
if if they're asking that many questions
and then you want to probably leave this
enabled as well send bot to sleep when I
send a message manually or through a
workflow so that you're not getting
double messages to the client okay so
the next step is we're going to come
over to bot training here and you can
see it's just asking you to input a URL
here so it's pretty simple you just have
to put the URL for whatever website you
are working with whatever company you're
working with this will scrape their
website for all relevant information to
train the bot it's really that easy you
do have two options where you can choose
just the exact URL or all urls with this
path or all urls in this domain the all
urls in this domain is going to be the
most inclusive and it's going to scrape
all of the sub Pages within that website
it will take a little longer but this is
definitely the most accurate way to
train your Bot so I would normally
recommend doing all urls in this domain
as this is going to get you the most
information for your Bot in this example
we're going to do just the exact URL
because it does go a little faster here
we are we found a random Clinic that
offers ketamine therapy we're going to
copy that URL paste it in here again
it's the exact URL click get data wait
for a second here and it's going to load
okay now that we finished uploading that
one link you can see it's here in this
uploaded Links Page if you have multiple
Pages then they're all going to show up
here you can add quite a few to train
the bot but again we're going to do just
that main homepage and then the next
step here is this FAQs you can add
frequently asked questions here like how
much does ketamine therapy cost and you
can provide an answer and let's just say
it's normally covered by
insurance if
not then it costs $400 something like
this so as you can see this is an easy
way to customize very common questions
but if the information is actually on
that web page then you don't really need
to do these FAQs this is just for
missing information save that we've
added our FAQ awesome now we're going to
come over to configure intents and you
can see that this is automatically
enabled and you can actually edit the
prompt if you want to change some of
those prompts for the bot I think the
already added values here from go high
level are pretty good and I don't think
I'd recommend changing these as you can
see it just basically says that you're a
bot your primary goal is to build trust
you have a goal to assist the customers
with their queries there's some
conversational guidelines as well being
attentive don't use emojis then it gives
some examples as well so these are
pretty good rules that I probably would
just leave as they are and then we have
appointment booking and this is where it
gets pretty cool so you're going to want
to enable this here and the next thing
you want to decide is whether or not you
want to have the bot actually book the
appointments conversationally or if you
want the bot just to send a booking link
then go ahead and check that box and it
will only send a booking link you do
also want to pick a calendar over here
so I would choose the correct calendar
if nothing pulls up here you just need
to come into calendars and set up a
simple calendar not too tricky check out
another video on my explanation of that
the pros of having this checked and only
sending a booking link is that it does
show if the lead is a little bit higher
intent because they're actually going in
they're clicking and they're scheduling
an appointment the con is that you
probably won't get as many appointments
booked this way just because it's a
little bit more friction and so it
depends on your specific situation but I
think leaving this unchecked is actually
the best way to take advantage of the AI
capabilities here so I'd hit save there
and then you come over to bot trial and
this is where you can actually test your
Bot and see if it's working so as you
can see we have it set to either general
question or appointment booking we're
going to do just general question first
and we're going to start by saying hey
and the the bot comes back with hey
what's on your mind today which is a
little bit vague we'd probably want to
fix that later but then we can say how
much does ketamine cost and then you can
see here this is the response that I
gave in that frequently Asked question
but you can tell that they actually
reworded it slightly so in those FAQs on
the bot training they don't have to be
perfectly written and the the bot can
actually interpret that information and
maybe rearrange it in a way that's more
conversational so that's pretty cool you
can see Kine therapy usually costs $400
if it's not covered by Insurance an
important part of this trial is to rate
responses as good or bad and so this is
a good response we're going to give that
a thumbs up but let's say we don't love
this first one we can do a thumbs down
and we can say we can actually adjust
this first part and
say hi how can I help you
and we could do train bot like that and
so now the next time we did a trial it
would actually adjust its answer that
way so we can reset the conversation and
we can try appointment booking next so
we can say hello there when are you open
for appointments and it says when would
you like to book an appointment do you
have any openings next week sure let me
check do you have a specific day in mind
for next week Wednesday or Thursday is
good and you can see it's actually
pulling out time slots from my actual
ual calendar so it says here's some
openings for the 26th of June 2024 8:00
a.m. 8:30 9 9:30 10 Which slot works for
you and I might actually say none of
those actually how about
afternoon and you can see how impressive
this is that it actually adjusts and
says okay let me look at the afternoon
slots and it provides a few options so
now if a lead was actually having this
conversation with an AI bot they could
simply just say 2 p.m sounds good and
then the bot's going to ask one
confirmation message here 2: p.m. on the
26th yep and then there you go great you
are booked for June 26th at 2 p.m. so
you can see it's pretty powerful for how
easy it is to set up it's a pretty
powerful AI booking bot you don't need
to know any coding you don't need to do
anything specific besides throw in a
link for the website that you want
information from it is pretty easy guys
so that's level one and I have to say if
you're new in the agency space and you
want to offer something to small
businesses this is a pretty good thing
to offer although I will say that you
should really focus on the value you're
adding and not just the shiny toy of the
AI if you're going to talk to small
businesses about selling them a chat bot
they don't really care what they really
want to know is how is this going to
help them drive more revenue and so what
you should really say is that this is
actually going to help you book more
appointments and that is something that
small business owners love to hear okay
we are moving on to level two and here
in workflows is where we're going to
build this AI appointment booking bot so
I've gone ahead and built one already
here called AI Automation and I'm going
to walk you through all of the things
here and this might look a little
daunting right now but I'm going to
simplify it don't worry so the first
thing we're going to start with as
normal with any workflow is a trigger
you can choose whatever you'd like but
if you're working with Facebook ads like
I am then you're going to go ahead and
hit form submitted the form is and
you're going to choose one of your
Facebook forms here I'm going to choose
this simple form and the very first step
is going to be adding a conversation AI
here so you go in and Google or search
for conversation AI click that that's
what I've added right here and you can
see that this is a question answer in
general QA I've gone ahead and named
this text or call because I want to know
if the lead prefers a text message or a
phone call from us you can see you've
got this whole personality section this
was mostly all already filled in by go
high level but I did update this a
little bit I added this custom value for
the location name I would recommend
doing that so that they know that
they're for that account this will fill
in Alder media here because that's the
sub account I'm in we scroll down to
additional instructions and you can see
here that we've got a lot of different
rules again these were already given by
go high level and they're they're pretty
great I didn't have to change any of
these you can see that a lot of this is
just helpful information to make sure
the bot replies appropriately and then
the question this is something that I
filled in this is where you're going to
fill in the very first question that you
want the thing to ask and so I said
something like hey there just saw you
filled out our Facebook form would love
to get you in the clinic soon just need
some basic B info first would you prefer
a phone call or text by the way this is
blank from blank right so again the
power of custom values is great we
scroll down here I leave the timeout at
about 3 hours that's how long that
you'll your Bot will give the potential
client this is how long your Bot will
give the potential client to respond
we've got our channel here we're going
to do SMS skip if answered I'd leave
that checked
on then we've got two automatically
filled out branches that you can't
change which is if no condition is met
or if the bot times out and I'll talk a
little bit more about that in a second
then I added these two branches which is
number one if they prefer text and
number two if they prefer call so the
patient prefers texting patient prefers
a phone call and guys the bot is pretty
smart you don't have to really say much
more than just this condition all right
so I'm going to go ahead and save that
action and I'm going to zoom out a
little bit so you can see the branch
here if they prefer a text then we're
going to send them down this branch and
I'm going to add another conversation AI
element the cool thing is you can
actually just go here and copy this and
you can copy just the action or all
actions from here which would be the
entire tree we don't want to do that
right now so you can just hit copy
action and you can see there's all these
places you can throw it in so that would
be the easiest way to do that I'd
recommend copying it hitting uh pasting
it right here and then you're going to
update the actual question so I have
qualifying question number one all this
other stuff is the same except question
and the first qualifying question I want
to know is how long have you been
suffering from depression question and
here I really just want to know if
they're answering the question or not
you really do have the option to make
multiple branches here like if you
wanted to have one branch being like Oh
you know they have suffered for
depression from for more than 3 months
or less than 3 months you could divide
that categories um but really for my
purposes I just want to know if they're
answering these questions because I'm
going to have somebody go back and look
at these answers anyway the bot is
really just there to get the qualifying
questions in the first place so we're
going to save that action we're going to
go ahead down to the answered branch and
we're going to do the exact same thing
we're just going to copy and paste this
over but now we're going to make a new
question and this time instead of how
long have you been suffering from
depression we might ask how many
anti-depressants have you tried in the
past same thing before we just want to
know if they're answering this question
cuz we're going to review it anyway and
we're just going to do the same thing
here for qualifying question number
three as you can see I'm going to scroll
through um same idea we might ask a
different qualifying question so what
insurance are you on save action you get
the idea we're going to ask all these
qualifying questions and by the very end
once they have answered all of our
qualifying questions this is where this
level two changes a little bit from
level one we're going to add just a
manual SMS here and we're going to send
them something like thank you so much
for answering these questions we're
going to reach out soon and get you set
up for an appointment this part is a
little bit actually limited from level
one because you can't conversationally
book right here and so that is one
limitation but it I call it level two
because you're able to be a lot more
specific with how you want the
conversation to go while still allowing
AI to help you so I just said great
click here to schedule an appointment
and you can add a link to your booking
calendar where they can then go in and
book and again this is a little bit
limited from the conversational booking
that we looked at in level one but it's
a little bit more specific in the way
that you're able to ask qualifying
questions as you go through and so then
you just want to come up here hit save
and go ahead and put this into publish
and now I'm going to save it again and
you should be good to go all right right
guys so now on to level three and this
is third party resources to build your
AI chap up I think honestly one of the
best is zappy chat but there are kind of
some AI bot Wars going on right now with
multiple people like cloth bot as you
can see zappy chat is all about
converting leads with quick kind and
thorough AI they've got a whole thing
here I'm going to walk you through kind
of what zappy chat looks like and why
it's helpful all right so in zappy chat
what you can see is that there's quite a
lot of customizable options they've got
a full interface to change the the bot
type The Prompt the bot description the
temperature all of these different
settings here to adjust what type of
booking bot you want to do so you can
tell that there really is a lot of
options and then basically the way this
works to integrate it into your sub
account is they have some API access
that you'll set up and then if you just
go into your sub account page it's not
too tricky you kind of just go in there
and add some custom scripts that they'll
be able to just copy and paste in and it
will integrate into your sub account and
so what zappy chat actually looks like
is a little bit like this where you can
see that you have a text flow and one of
the cool things here is that you can
actually have it schedule an appointment
into calendly natively so it's kind of
like that that uh texting flow that we
were talking about earlier but this is
pretty cool cuz it's just right within
cly and you can do that through texting
again another powerful integration and a
reason why this level three option with
zappy chat other third party sources can
be pretty helpful so I'm just going to
show you what this looks like here you
can see they enter their name and email
and then zappy chat is thinking and
they've you know just like before they
show these available times and this is
all through calendly so same idea as the
go high level calendar but now it's
integrated through calendly which is
helpful and so to show you the actual
pricing for zapy chat it is a little bit
hidden it's like all the way at the
bottom so it's kind of hard to find that
pricing but it is here at the bottom it
says it starts at $19 7 a month so that
is not exactly super cheap if you are
brand new to go high level or something
and you don't have a ton of clients but
obviously that can work pretty well if
you have multiple clients and you're
scaling up a little bit okay guys that's
all I've got today hopefully you
understand a little bit more how to set
up an AI appointment booking bot on go
high level in three different ways level
one two and three they all have their
pros and cons uh if you like this video
go ahead drop a like and if you have any
questions go ahead and drop them in the
comments I'll be sure to get back to you
and if you want to try this out yourself
then go go ahead and sign up for a free
trial the link in my description and you
can build your own AI appointment
booking bot right away all right guys
talk to you later
