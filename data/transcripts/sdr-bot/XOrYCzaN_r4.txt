want to be your own AI agent that chat
with customer from anywhere from
WhatsApp to Facebook and Instagram. So
in this video I will walk you through
how to be a fully functional omni
channel AI agent using Kai AI agent
beta. For those who don't know Kai, Kai
is our our AI agent from Cleanto Cloud
which is designed to automate the entire
customer conversation across any
internet. Do you want to try it out guy
AI agent? visit the link below and sign
it up for free. Okay, in order to create
a AI agent, go to the AI agent and then
create a new AI agent and then give a
name. So in this example, I'm going to
create a knowledgeb for escape
bar and then you can set add inactivity
time out. The default is 10 minutes. So
which mean after the 10 minute uh the AI
session will complete and close the
conversation. For now, I'm I'm going to
click create and then click
studio. All right. So, in here, all you
have to do is add agent. So, so before
we add a agent, we uh we're going to
need to create a knowledge base. Okay.
In order to create a knowledge b, uh go
to the add knowledge b here and then
click create a new knowledge b. In this
uh in this knowledge b, we support three
types of knowledge b. You can write your
own articate uh to train your AI agent
or you can upload your PDF document and
then you can sync way uh and your
website address. So in this example I'm
going to show you way sync with the
website URL. So click website URL. I'm
going to crawl the data from the website
URL. Here is the escape bar. So which is
a bar from uh Bangkok. So I'm going to
copy this URL and then paste it. So here
we have two option. So you can uh you
can specify what specific website URL to
crawl a single web page or you can crawl
all the set web pages uh behind uh
behind this the the main domain. So in
this example I'm going to use way crawl
web page from the URL and then I'm going
to click sync. So now the now that our
AI is crawling the data from the uh from
this the website URL and then training
the data. So it would take a few minutes
or a few second depends of your size of
your website and the website and the
data
source. All
right. All right. So now my the
knowledge b training is completed. So
okay let me show you how to set it up
the knowledgeb agent. So now I'm going
to open the studio of the escape
bar and then I'm going to create a new
agent. So we have a survey agent here
for in this example. Uh I'm going to
show you um two option. So the first
option is general inquiry agent. So
especially to take the reservation for
the escape bar. So I will say like uh
reservation
agent. So I will say like I want to
create reservation agent for
escaper. Uh we open every day
uh every day
from 5:00 p.m. to 100
a.m. And our happy hour time
is start
from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00
p.m. So,
okay. Okay. So this is how I created um
uh reservation agent. Uh if okay I will
write another prompt if customer as
about
menus, drinks,
wine and other information
uh transfer
to knowledge base
agent. Okay. And then I'm going to
generate a
instruction. So this instruction is
customizable on your own. So depends for
your workflow. So here you have the
agent reservation state from escape bar
which operate daily from 5:00 p.m. to
100 p.m. Your role is to help customer
make reservation efficiently. Follow
this step. Confirm the customer desire
reservation. As for the number get happy
hour, user reservation to the
book.
Okay.
Okay. Okay. Sounds
great. Okay. All right. So, and then I'm
going to save uh this
agent. Okay. After save uh I'm going to
you we can test inside this emulator.
So, I'm going to test in the
imulator. Okay, here. Hello. I'll be
happy with your reservation. Let's
give Okay.
Uh, can I book a table
for next
Friday? Okay. 700
p.m. Okay. D the number. Good. Also,
yeah. So, the AI know about me, my name
and my email because uh he the AI know
because I'm logging way this account.
So, the AI in in this emulator uh the AI
already know who is about me. So if you
run uh this AI agent on your messaging
channel like WhatsApp and on Instagram,
so they will also note about you. So who
you are, what's your name? So yeah,
basically the AI going to know
everything about you. All right. So I'm
going to give some phone
number. Okay. So thank you for let me
number guess. Okay. to
guess please know that okay go ahead yes
go
ahead yeah now uh it successfully uh
book a t for me for the next Friday so
and we can also connect way a calendar
of um calendar or the geshi or any
reservation system via by using our
action API. So I will leave it uh this
part for now. So I will is part of the
advanced feature. Then I will show you
in in the next video. All right. So I'm
going to ask a little bit of another
question like okay do you have any
special
wine? Okay. So it say no more no to
route. So which mean um uh because we
didn't set it up the transition. So, so
here I'm going to explain about how to
set up the transition. Okay. So, all you
have to do is click
transition. Okay. The transition me.
Okay. You can write a uh condition here.
For example, like if
customer ask about
uh menu, drinks, wine
[Music]
collection, got this or any other
additional
information. So you can write a
condition like this. So if this
condition are met, the AI will route to
a different agent. So let's say transfer
to knowledgebased
agent. Okay. Uh now if this condition
are meet it will transfer to the
knowledge v agent then okay. Oh sorry
again I I I can add a knowledge b agent
here. So it's same like uh this flow um
okay you can say an instruction on here
like create a knowledge base agent for
escape bar to answer any question
related
to use trains
why and any
other
information related to
uh escape bar and then I'm going to
generate
uh instruction. So the AI will generate
the instruction and then you you have to
choose the knowledge source. So in this
so we we already train the data from the
escape part website. So all you have to
do is uh this knowledge source and then
click save. Okay. Then then and then you
have to connect way like this.
Okay. So if this condition on me and
then you will transfer to the to the
knowledge B agent. Okay. So let me test
again. Okay. Do you have any special
wine? Let me ask the same question. Oh,
okay. We need to restart the uh the
session. So, so I will restart the chat
and then I'm going to initiate a new
conversation and let's see how it work.
Okay. Okay. I will ask the same
question. Do you
have any
special? Okay. So now I ask about the
menu. So, so the AI transfer to the
knowledge agent and then it extracted
the data and after that it went
successfully respond back to the uh uh
the data which is from the knowledge
bay. So here ex offer a variety of
special code the color
different okay a refreshing melo quality
delegated okay that's amazing so and
also it's also linked back to their to
their website so here okay now is link
back to the escape bar menu okay so I'm
going to go back to the
agent okay I'm going to test
in okay so here this is a suggestion
it's automatically popular but I will
write manually so do you have any
special
wine so now it is extra data from the
knowledge B and then responding back to
the wine collection escaper off of
isolation of special wine is a comp
option And so yeah, so this is how we uh
set it up the AI agent. Okay. So after
we set it up everything, all you have to
do is publish the uh your AI agent and
give a name. So in this example, I will
say like version one. So you can change
by this template any time. So it's very
easy to to modify yourself. You don't
need any technical knowledge. Okay. So
now everything is set up. So after set
it up the next step you have to do a
connect your messaging channel here. So
go to the setting connect your messenger
channel. So we support all these channel
name from the website live chat Facebook
messenger Instagram live WhatsApp. So
you can connect one of these channel or
you can even connect all of these
channel. So for the WhatsApp you can
easily connect with your existing uh
WhatsApp phone number by simply scanning
the QR code. You don't need any complex
uh integration with the WhatsApp. So
it's very straightforward. So so just
follow the instruction and connect the
channel. Okay. So by scanning it to a
go. So same way the other channel. So
you can follow the step-by-step
instruction and connect with the
channel. So after connected the channel,
so what will happen is uh you will see
and the connected channel like this.
Okay. The next step you have to do is
you need to create a new workflow. So,
so, so to to use the AI agent. So, I'm
going to create a new AI new workflow
and then I will say like okay escape
bar. Okay. ES
escape AI
agent. Okay. So, so all you have to do
is you need to add a simple trigger. So,
so the first trigger is when a terror
room is open which mean trigger when a
when a customer send their first message
and then condition it choose the
channel. So for example in this example
uh you can choose one of the any
available channel your Instagram channel
or your your Facebook channel. So you
can you can choose it. So in this
example I'm going to choose one of the
channel here.
Okay, let me
just Okay, I would choose uh this
channel as
examp agent. So which mean uh this
condition are meet um you assign to AI
agent and then assign to the escape AI
agent and then you enable the channel
and save it. So that's it. So this is
how you set up the AI agent. All
right. All right. So now I'm open by my
messaging channel and I'm going to send
it a few text message. So do you have
any special wine
collection? Okay. So now uh I just send
a message now that our AI agent is uh
extracting the data from the knowledge
base and it will respond uh shortly. So
depending on the data so it might take a
few seconds uh to extract the data and
it will send back shortly. So now the AI
responding okay we have escape bar offer
is special wine collection. Yeah. So
blah blah. So so this is how we set it
up the AI agent uh for all the omni
channel platform. So thank you for
