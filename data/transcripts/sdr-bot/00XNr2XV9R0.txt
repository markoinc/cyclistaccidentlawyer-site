up liking this video definitely like it
let's jump into the video now so we're
going to be talking about the
conversational AI bot this is actually
just recently launched about three weeks
ago brand new I've been playing around
with it um I'm fairly new to it
myself but I've been planing that I
think is pretty cool so there's two
different types of AI Bots with Co high
level hey
danella there's two different Bots okay
you got your conversational Bots which
could basic basically just be like
customer service okay and then you also
have the booking Bots which can actually
book people on to your calendar okay so
let me just drop a quick link into the
school chat too so everybody has the
link it is going to be fun this is one
of my favorite features so far I think
this is going to take off this is
probably going to put a lot of
appointment Setters uh out of jobs once
it starts to get really really Advanced
so this is where you go you if you're in
your go high level settings go to
conversation AI okay and then go to bot
settings you can do trial which is
pretty cool where you can actually
practice and spend time with your Bots
and see how they handle conversations
and then you also have bot training
where you could take FAQs from your
website you could take body else's
website let's say you have clients that
you're actually building a spot for take
those websites and upload it if let's
say you know Bri you guys are offering
virtual assistants you could take a
whole bunch of um articles that talk
about what virtual assistants can do
Filipino vas and stuff like that take a
bunch of links upload it here and then
click get data okay and then it's
actually going to start to grab all that
data from these websites to train the
bot so that it could start doing
customer service okay and then you can
also configure the intent and say you
know whether or not you wanted to
actually do appointment booking okay and
as far as the bot setting goes you can
either do suggestive or autopilot right
we got Joshua joining what's up
Joshua doing good we got the
conversation AI so if you want to set
this up on your go high level this is
how you do it you go to your settings
you go to you go to conversation AI uh
you'll be able to set this up right here
so I was actually just mentioning that
you can actually do a trial and actually
chat with your chatbot and test out how
it would handle conversations this could
do both customer service and do bookings
you could do training where you actually
upload FAQs and upload various websites
that you have maybe even articles about
some of the services that you provide to
train up the bot and then you can also
configure the intents right and have it
do appointment book appointment booking
from here as well and you can actually
have it book you could choose whether or
not you wanted to actually send a
booking link right if you wanted to send
a booking link rather than just booking
directly into your calendar it could
just send a booking link and let the
customer or Prospect book themselves you
can also pause the bot after booking
some people like to do this because they
have automations after somebody
books right most people have automations
after they book so you might want to use
this feature here and then you can also
yeah you could pause it for a certain
amount of days and then after those
certain amount of days it could
reactivate and then you could trigger
trigger another workflow after booking
and select the workflow that you want to
trigger after booking which is pretty
cool now as far as editing the prompt
right support and general uh uh question
and answer this would be basically be
like a customer service bot so I can
edit the prompt and enter in everything
that I want them to do right so I could
say you know answer questions about
virtual assistance typically we offer
four to5 doll an hour virtual assistance
and we go and we typically find them in
the Philippines and da da your goal is
to just chat with them see if they have
any further questions questions and ask
if they're looking to book a call you
know Point them in the direction of
Joseph they're going to be chatting with
Joseph and d right so this is one way to
do it and it's very very simple you turn
it off and it starts messaging just like
you saw Joshua you were texting me and
for like an entire day I had no clue
that my bot was just texting you and
you're were like oh this is confusing
what are you talking about that was just
my bot just taking over I didn't realize
I activated it and it was just having a
full-on conversation with you which is
hilarious um so you also have advanced
settings right so you can actually put
your business name here as far as
autopilot mode goes you can choose how
quickly you want it to respond so you
can make it to where it's instant which
I wouldn't recommend i' typically
recommend about about two minutes to
make it as natural as possible okay so
two minutes I'd say you could do three
or four if you want maximum messages a
bot could send to a contact the absolute
Max that you could do is
25 okay so I recommend just doing 25 it
shouldn't time you shouldn't prefer that
it times out sooner because sometimes
people have a whole lot of questions
before they book with you so you don't
want it to time out too early so 25 is
the max so I choose 25 you'll notice
here that you can't do any more than 25
you could send bot to sleep when I send
a message so basically Whenever I send a
message the bot will be put to sleep and
let me continue the conversation so I
could set this to be four hours I can
make it wait one day or a couple minutes
so I could do 24 hours if I want so
that's what I would turn on because last
thing that I want like Joshua when you
and I were having a conversation I think
the AI bot still chimed in um actually I
think it didn't because it turned off
when I sent this message I had this two
hours on so you don't want to start
chiming in and saying you know a bunch
of different things while we're still
having our conversation that would be
stupid now typically it's about two
cents per response which is really cool
okay very very affordable um it's
basically like an AI assistant I mean if
we do the math on this even if we're
sending let's say you know 2,000
messages per month that's going to come
out to 40 bucks okay you're guaranteed
going to be paying an assistant
significantly more than that even if
it's sending 10,000
messages that's going to end up
being I mean this is easy math but yeah
200 bucks got to make sure 200 bucks so
50 bucks a week okay so you can either
have a real person the great thing is
you can also set this to turn off at
certain times so I could say during
business hours and I'm going to show you
how to do that in a minute here you're
not you're not able do it from these
settings it looks like but I'll show you
how to actually set specific times that
could work so we got
charil what's up
charil we're talking about
conversational uh AI here you came a
little bit late so I'll send you the the
recording afterwards by the way whenever
we have these calls all the recordings
are always placed in the coaching call
recordings within the courses okay so
the next way that you could do this you
go to your
automations okay so let's go to
automations let's go to create workflow
start from
scratch and let's say the trigger is
going to be when a customer
replies okay so we'll do customer
reply and you can also add filters and
it could be like people that only have
like a specific tag or something if
that's what you want so I could say has
tag you know let's say they come from
Facebook right so it'll be Facebook lead
this is just an
example and then you would come here and
you would look up booking right the
appointment booking conversation AI bot
Eliza AI appointment bot this one's kind
of outdated don't use this one this one
doesn't really perform perform well and
is also more expensive I think it's like
six cents per
message the appointment book and
conversation bot this is the one that
you're going to be using so you'll
actually choose the calendar that you
want them to book on to so in my case it
would be this
you're going to create the personality
so you could say like you're really
funny you make jokes every other message
or like you like to crack jokes a lot
and keep the conversation going um if
they end up not messaging you you you
crack jokes in terms of like hey where'd
you go is everything all right you want
me to order an ambulance or something
call an ambulance for you you know you
can give all different types of
personality traits and things that they
could say and maybe some of the
additional stuff that I was mentioning
you can also add into the additional
instructions so personality I mean you
could literally use chat gbt to create
like a really good customer service
personality to say hey I'm I'm creating
an appointment seter bot can you lay out
some sort of uh standard personality
type of someone would who would be
really humorous but would book me a
whole bunch of appointments and is
really eager to get an appointment okay
and then for additional instructions I
could literally just brain dump into my
additional instructions so I'm going to
start just like literally typing
everything about my service is what we
do what the goal is who they're going to
be talking to you know don't don't say
the price via text let them know that
they're going to have to get on a call
if they want to figure out the price
because we have different packages it's
not one siiz fits-all okay literally
everything you could possibly think
about your service maybe even services
that you won't be selling on the call
like if they have questions about maybe
mini courses that you have or other
products that hey if you don't want to
book an appointment why don't you just
take a look at our our course that we
have here we have a course for five
bucks I can give instructions like that
as well okay I could even put the link
in here I could put the link in here for
them to be able to uh go and buy that
course I think that option is a little
bit buggy but it's something that you
could play around with okay and test out
so same thing is here right maximum
limit 25 okay limit is five to 25 as you
could see here as far as timeout value
if so this is the time for which the bot
waits for a reply okay so it's going to
wait and if if I understand correctly
and from what I've seen so far this
means that it's it's going to send
another message if they don't answer
okay so you could set this to 24 hours
you could set it to three hours two
hours six hours I would recommend
probably three to four right if they
don't message back in three to four
hours I want them to uh to to message
again now I haven't tested this one too
much I'm going to come back to this on
our next call and we'll chat about this
I I need to make sure that timeout means
that it's going to send another message
versus it just times out and stops
talking because I don't want that to
happen but I'm pretty sure this is the
case and I'm not sure whether I don't
have more information here okay so same
thing units uh minutes days so just
based on the fact that they allow you to
do minutes I'm assuming that it's going
to send another message now as far as
channel the coolest thing about this is
that you can connect your Facebook
Messenger you can connect your Instagram
DMS and you can also have it do it for
SMS so if you wanted to connect your
your Instagram DMs
and start running Instagram DM ads and
have an appointment set or talking to
everybody that comes through immediately
when they come through through Instagram
you can have an appointment set are
booking appointments for you through
your Instagram DMS with this AI okay so
you can create three separate automation
workflows one for SMS one for Facebook
one for Instagram all with different
settings okay maybe you want the the
timeout to be a little bit less for
Instagram because people are quick to
just jump to the next thing when it
comes to Instagram versus being able to
text them okay maybe uh if we go up here
maybe you want it to time out after uh
you know 20 messages 15 messages if it's
Facebook who knows right so I recommend
doing different
workflows for each uh platform okay so
let's say in this case it's just SMS now
if you if you want the automations that
you have set in place for if someone
books an appointment with you to kick in
and that the AI doesn't continue to have
a conversation after they book then
you'll click this check box here because
you don't want it to say hey we just
booked your appointment because you have
an automation that does that and then
also the AI Bots also saying okay cool
your appointment's confirmed and then
they get two confirmation uh things so
this wouldn't replace the old igdm
strategy because that's cold DM this is
not cold DM this is uh this is for
someone messages you first yeah so as
far as timeout goes uh this is still
more stuff that I have to play around
with
okay so I haven't really touched this
too much looks like it's actually uh
grayed out but this is more stuff that
I'll touch on and continue to create
more videos I'm also making videos that
I post on YouTube as well so you can go
there I'll also be posting a whole bunch
of course content within the community
so now at this point I'd just like to
open up the floor for any
questions awesome
Bri uh yeah so um right now I've got uh
Christine calling people um and
sometimes they'll like send a message
back something like hey can you just
text
me and can I have like a bot take over
at that point so she can just keep call
okay yep so yeah if customer replies and
it meets the criteria that you have said
in the workflow so if they have a
specific tag or something or you have it
complet you can have it completely open
I don't recommend that because sometimes
you'll get random like spam Bots calling
you and texting you you don't want
everybody you know getting the bot
because then you're just wasting money
so make sure that whoever's you know
going to be texting you that you want
the AI bot to kick in for matches with
that tag so use only tags that you
actually use within the workflow so you
could definitely do that that'd be a
great option and then she can continue
to call and then AI will take over
that's a really great way to pair your
appointment seter along with this AI bot
that'd be really
awesome okay
you can also add more workflows here so
I could say you know if they timeout I
can have it add a timeout tag and I can
make it do something else I can make if
they time out so okay here we
go okay this kind of answers my question
remember we were talking about the
timeout value here so this is what you
can you can make something happen here
if they time out so for instance I can
add a tag that says time out and then I
can create another
workflow where if they get hit with the
tag
timeout it starts to bot all over again
and does another followup right so I I
can create a whole entire other workflow
where if they get hit with the timeout
tag the AI bot starts again and sends
them another message which would be
pretty cool Joshua you had a
question yes does this um to get this is
it only in your version of go high level
no any any go high level could do this
so I've been using chat GPT aggressively
for my YouTube thumbnails okay for my
YouTube thumbnails and you'll notice
here we can create some really really
cool images right so this is a guy
staring at a camera I mean this would
definitely get somebody's attention
right this would definitely 100% get
somebody's
attention is this the paid version of
chat gbt yes it is if you don't have the
paid version I think you're able to
generate like one photo and then that's
it if you go to meta and let me actually
show you a couple other cool photos that
created because you can also it's 20
bucks I think it's 20 bucks it's like 22
or something like that you can also
create like cartoonish images clation I
say I say Pixar themed a lot and I
always like to do like shocked faces
same thing with advertisements if you
guys are going to start doing
advertisements and you want people to
actually click on the photos and
actually opt in always tell uh Chad GPT
to either create like really crazy faces
or really shocked faces I like to have
cash flying all over the place all the
time lights and clouds and smoke and
stuff uh I always like a nice view in
the background if we're in a in a room
right let's see some other images I've
created let's see this is crazy right
tell me this wouldn't be captivating
only issue here is that it created a
baby for some reason I didn't ask it to
create a baby so sometimes it gets kind
of weird uh with stuff like that but as
long as you keep on tweaking it over and
over again like you'll come up you'll
come up with some really cool images I
mean I could do this all day long it's
so fun let me see what else I came up
with there's one other photo here yeah
these are a couple later ones so let's
look at metad doai there's a couple cool
things that we um came across last time
that we looked at this let me actually
take this prompt and put it in here all
right so let's see whenever you're
generating a an AI image the coolest
thing about
meta is that you can turn these images
into
photos right so let's look at this this
is a guy yeah this is that is this is
actually really good look at
this WOW kind of Super HD so now let's
let's click on animate watch
this and if you take this yeah it's
going to be about that's crazy if you
take this this is about maybe three or 4
seconds if you take this download it put
it in cap cut and make it repeat over
and over again for 15 seconds instead of
you know 4 seconds because you don't
want an ad that's four 4 seconds long
because then it's going to just play for
four seconds and it's going to
immediately pull a button up you want it
to kind of play out a bit so they could
read stuff and see what's going on and
then decide if they want to click the
button so I could take an image like
this I could download it put it on cap
cut make it repeat itself three or four
times to create a 15c to 20 second
advertisement and then add some words on
it so I could say you know this is how I
scaled my business whatever it wouldn't
actually say that but come up with
something that's better of course let's
look at some of the other ones and see
what else we can
animate uh let's go back
here let's take a look at this one
animate this see just how crazy this
gets it's also interesting to see what
meta would do
versus Dolly on chat gbt yeah this is
kind of crazy wouldn't his eyes look
really really
weird I probably wouldn't use this
one is hilarious but yeah so far you
guys liking this pretty crazy stuff if
you ended up liking that video and you
