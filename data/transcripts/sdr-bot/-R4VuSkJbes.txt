Number one question I got asked this
week was, "Why are my ads not scaling?"
Now, we manage over $3 million a month
in ads, and this is the number one
mistake I see most brands make. They
don't follow up. And I'm going to share
my screen right here and break down the
exact follow-up method that we found to
make $3 million a month with 80% profit
margins. Hey there, my name is Brad
Smith, owner of Automation Links, and
I've been doing this branding stuff for
the last 10 years, worked with over 200
brands. If you want this system that I'm
breaking down to teach you how to copy
and paste how to follow up with all your
leads, comment system down below.
Somebody from my will send it over.
Well, let's not wait any longer. Let's
dive in. All right, so on my screen
here, I'm going to walk through the
number one mistake most brands make.
They spend all this time right here, top
of funnel, attracting new leads. They
send them all to their website and then
that's it. They stop right there and
hope for a sale. Now, if you're spending
money on ads, the most expensive ads
come from attracting a new lead into
your landing page or your website. But
the lowest cost ads are the retargeting.
That's everything that comes out after
somebody hits your page. And it's the
relationship builder. Retarget because
you already know who the person is. You
build a relationship and then they
remember to work with you when they're
ready. So today's video, I'm going to
walk down the chatbot to build these
ads, build the emails and the SMS, the
retargeting, and ensure that you follow
up with everyone. Now, before you start
doing this, you need to ensure that you
have the proper proper pixels in place.
So, I need to know that this lead that
visited my website, what their name is,
what their email is, and that I can
retarget them. I need to know that this
person that came to my site, where they
found me from, which ad they clicked on,
which pages they visited. I need to know
if this lead right here, exactly what
their actions were. Did they become a
lead, or did they just watch and leave
right away? Now, what I want to
encourage you to use is a company called
Data Shopper that'll actually attract
and link each one of these people. I'll
put the link down in the description
below. So, now that I know that even if
this person doesn't fill out the form on
my website, I can retarget them. All
right. Now, you also want to make sure
your pixels are in place. I have other
videos on my channel walking through
pixels. You can always learn more about
that on a different video. The next
thing you need to do is come up with a
plan. So, right here, I just went into
my chatbot. If you're still using Chat
GBT, you're missing out on high quality
creatives art. Al robot here. It writes
the copywriting for us based on
million-dollar copywriters. So, it knows
exactly how to write this to actually
get somebody to read it, have it go
viral, have a good hook, and ensure it
gets sold without emojis and dashes. So,
what I did was I asked Al here simply,
give me a seven follow-up email and ad
flow that you can do. And basically what
it did was it wrote my email, it wrote
my next email, it wrote my SMS, and then
what it's going to do is continue
writing for you even the retargeting ad.
So, it knows exactly I know exactly
which ads I should put in. So this is
the ad I should write. This is the email
I should write. This is the SMS I should
write. And then this is that last email
I should write. So you need a plan. You
need to put this framework together so
you can ensure that you follow up the
right way with the same message. So you
can see when we head back to the
marketing map that after they hit the
page and they see the price and our
landing page, we want to start
retargeting them with Twitter ads,
LinkedIn ads, Meta, Instagram, even
YouTube ads I like to run. I see those
work very powerfully for building
relationships and building trust. But
these ads, they should also mark match
the emails and the SMS. So whatever that
messaging is that was in your attraction
phase where you attract the leads, that
messaging needs to be on your landing
page, but it also needs to be that same
messaging on your retargeting ads as the
email. So think about your ideal
customer. Your ideal customer sees you,
they see that you offer a solution to
their painoint. They come to your site,
then they start seeing an email that
matches that painoint, an ad that
matches that painoint, and then they see
you a second time the next day. Then
they see you a third time, and then they
see your ads. Every time they log into
social media, every time they log into
their their email, they see your email.
Now they're starting to see you as the
authority, the brand that they can
trust. So what we want to do is match
these so they're similar. And how we do
that is we do that in our social poster
over here. We create the post to match
in our emails as the same as our ads.
And I'll show you that next. So once you
come in here, you can choose based on
which social media platform you want to
run ads to. And then you can choose how
you want to write it. If you want to get
something that really sticks out to
somebody that they're not aware of, if
you want to give thoughts and ideas and
education. For me, I really like talking
as the sage or the visionary. And that's
really going to provide a ton of
education. And then you tell it what you
wanted to write the post about. So this
actually helped me write the topic for
today's video. It's going to help me
write all the social media posts for it.
And it basically gives you the hook,
gives you the entire post that you can
do. And as you can see, mine is
education focused. And then it creates
all the posts for you on every channel
that you can use organically and as ads.
Then what you want to do is you want to
come take this same narrative, these
same ads, and you want to head over to
the automation and you want to plug
these into your emails. So it writes the
emails educating them about the same
thing. So when I see your ad, you're
educating me. When I see your email,
you're educating me. when I see your ad
the next day, you're providing value,
your email, I'm providing value, and it
just goes on and on from there. So, when
we look at the flow, that person is now
going to see you 24 times on three
different platforms. So, when they're
finally ready to buy, they know exactly
that you're the expert and you're the
brand that they can trust. They can come
back to this checkout page. You can have
a way for them to purchase right away.
You can have a way so you can give them
an upsell. You can invite them to a
community. You can basically increase
your conversion rates and also increase
your profits on ads by doing this. Now,
it doesn't stop there. I want to really
encourage you is after somebody
purchases, you want to get them in a
flow where you add them to your
newsletter. Now they can start reading
your newsletter every week or every
month, they can start forwarding that
newsletter to any referrals or friends
that they have. You want to start asking
for them to invite other people into
your ecosystem or share your post. And
then you also want to be asking them for
reviews so they can go leave you a
review after a certain amount of time
here. So that's how you're going to
really increase your profit without
spending more ads is if you dial all of
this in. Okay. So you can see here that
one of our clients actually did this and
over the last year they've increased
their profits by like 60% running our
ads, running our the marketing like this
and increasing ROI, which is the most
important thing for a business. Now, if
this video brought you any value, it'd
be awesome if you subscribe to my
channel. And if you want to watch more
videos about this, we go through it
every week. Monday, we talk about
attracting your ideal customers, and
that's going to be the attraction phase.
Wednesdays, we talk about converting
them, how to get them to convert. And
then Fridays, we talk about that
follow-up to get them to actually
purchase and increase your profits. So
again, this video, if you want this
exact system, comment system down below.
Somebody from my team will send it over.
And I hope to see you on my next
