I've really outdone myself this video is
absolutely leagues above any video I've
made so far and it's for one single
reason we're going to build the most
advanced AI appointment setter from the
ground up now I've made videos about
appointment Setters in the past but
those mostly started off with blueprints
for you to edit and build on and that
caused a lot of frustration with my
viewers because they were building on
something that they did not really
understand if you follow along with this
video step by step you will have a flaw
AI appointment seter that can pick up
calls add customers to an air table base
book appointments through cal.com update
that customers's conversation logs and
save meeting IDs remember past
conversations completely when people
call back reschedule meetings using the
saved meeting IDs save Advanced calls
history in a calls table in air table
give you a full custom dashboard in a
table interfaces that will show you
total cost total number of calls made
reason call ended and the average cost
per call I not seen a video as beginner
friendly and advanced friendly as this
one my purpose in this video is not to
just give you a set of blueprints that
you're going to plug and play and sell
for thousands of dollars I also want to
teach you how the system actually works
and how you can tweak it and make it
your own because let's be honest in this
automation space the most important tool
in your toolbox is not offensive
blueprints it's not a copy and pastable
air table base it's your knowledge and
knowing how to tweak it how to edit it
and also how to understand it having
said that of course I'm going to give
you everything you need to hit the
ground running completely for free this
video has the best set of blueprints and
documentation of any video I've made so
far so if you're watching this on your
phone keep watching because this will
give you a great Advantage when later
you're going to be sitting behind your
desk and actually building out this
agent you will know what you're actually
going to build what to tweak what to
look out for it's going to give you a
great Advantage for later but do make
sure that you of course subscribe to
this Channel and save this video so you
can actually follow along now if you're
already behind your desk and ready to
start building I suggest that you follow
along step by step to get the most out
of this video so before we start you
need to visit our member platform at
members. f.com and make a free account
you have over 1,00 members on that
platform right now and it will give give
you all of the tools that you need need
in this video so if you go to members.
flo.com this is what you're going to see
once you've made your account and then
of course if you get stuck at any point
you can go to this page book 101 with me
and I will help you go through that you
can check out the partner portal there's
a lot of people coming in every day
people you can reach out to to build
together but also you can make your own
profile make it public and people can
reach out to you and of course join our
Discord community so if you want very
specific answers to your questions
there's over 500 people in this
community about 53 are online you can
ask your question there's a high
possibility that someone will answer it
very rapidly now if you want to give
yourself a big Advantage for 2025 check
out the 2025 AI Advantage kit it's the
kit that we're selling with um fero it
has everything you need from onni
Channel functionality to a complete
outbound caller all of the tools and
blueprints are in this Advantage agent
you can check that out and if you have
any questions about it send me a message
and will help you make the best decision
for your use case but for now of course
we're going to go to resources right
here and there's a list of resources for
every video that I make this is this
part of the platform is completely free
you can go through all of these boss
videos and look at those resources the
one for this specific video is going to
be added later so don't click this one
but click the newest one you will have
everything you need in order to build
and follow along with this video now
since this one is a little different
from my other videos you do get all of
the blueprint that you can instantly
plug in there and edit if you're already
familiar with it but you will still have
to follow along with the video to
actually understand how does this
blueprint work how can I change it how
can I tweak it how does it work at the
make.com level at the VAP level at the
air table level so we'll get you
familiar with that entire Tex stch so
let's get into it so what we're going to
do is call this agent we're going to
call it and then it's going to book a
meeting for us and then in the history
so in that last conversation it's going
to be able to remember what meeting we
booked the second time that we called
and then if we call back then it's going
to be able to book a new meeting for an
hour later for example and then delete
the existing one and then book a new one
so that's what we're going to do right
now
H hi um yeah could you book a
meeting name uh my full name is Jasper
Jasper's fine J what's your
appoint fine basically I just want to
have a quick want uh any date and time
is okay really how about next
week right let me you in how does Monday
febrary 10 a. sound oh yeah sounds good
appoint conf
for up um no that's all right thank you
thank you for cont have a great day
right we do really have to change that
voice there's like 3,000 voices that you
can choose from I think this is a
terrible voice but uh Hey it sounds uh
sounds good enough so at the end of the
call we get the call summary so the logs
and as you can see all the details that
we want are inside of here so let's call
that agent back again and see if it can
reschedule that meeting if look at the
transcript it should say when it booked
the meeting so February 5th at 10 a.m.
let's call the back and see if we can
schedule that meeting for an hour
later hello this can I today um could
you remind me when for which time slot
do we book our meeting sure your book is
for Monday February 5th at 10 a.m. ready
to KCK off the week with resed that to
an hour
later you're all your appointment is now
resed like Monday feary at 11 A.M
anything else you need I WRA this up no
that's it thank you thank you for cont
Dent have a great day all right very
quickly before we get started I wanted
to thank you guys for all of the uh
feedback and support and the enthusiasm
around the channel and the memory
Community I think that's uh great and
it's incredibly motivating so let me
know in the comments what you think of
video videos like these the actual over
the shoulder videos and if you have any
questions you can find my LinkedIn right
here I'm very active on LinkedIn
actually some people have found me on
Instagram so I decided to follow up on
people who reach out to me there as well
so um yeah thank you very much and let's
get started all right so let's get
started with building uh we're going to
be building with of course VY make.com
airable and twio and the first thing
you're going to need to do is log into
to vapy so you go to dashboard. vy. or
vy. a going to make a free account uh I
think you still get around $10 of free
credits which are your calling credits
you can call for $10 for free um but
you'll quickly have to check that in any
case if that's something that they stop
doing you can add your billing details
here so add your payment
method by going here going to uh billing
add your credit card there's two things
you'll need them for uh first of all for
your usage so if you do get a $10 you
can of course use that um if you don't
you're going to have to top up your
balance and also for for um buying phone
numbers now there's two ways of adding
phone numbers most of you guys are
already familiar with that you can
either buy a phone number right here
after adding your credit card details or
you can import a phone number from twio
which is something that I'm going to
show you in a
bit um now the first thing we're going
to be doing in vapy is building an agent
very quickly there's two types of Agents
transient and persistent agent
trans persistent agents are the ones
inside of Vy they will always be the
same and the only way to change them is
by going into vapi logging in and
changing those details right there
transient agents are something outside
of vapy that can edit dynamically so
every call you can change certain
elements of your agents without logging
into vappy I'll show you what that means
in a bit my last video I went more in
depth on this how can you strategically
Leverage the dashboard in vapi to
quickly build your agent call that API
and then turn that into a transient
agent um I'm not going to go very in
depth on that in this video but I am
going to show you step by step how to
actually do that so when you've logged
into VY just follow along with my steps
and then you will be able to build the
same agent I've set up completely blank
accounts so a new vapy account a new
make.com organization a free account in
air table and also a free account in
twio and wherever you have to add your
credit card details I will tell you but
all the rest uh is just the same for you
so if you just follow along you um will
get the same results as I do all right
so when you go into vapi um you're going
to click platform here and then you're
going to click create
assistant and then you can call this
anything you want um like
And subscribe I like that one um for
this case we're going to build an
appointment setter create
assistant and then this is the
persistent agent that we've built uh
that we get inside of appy now I'm
quickly going to edit some small things
there's some things that just make your
agent uh sound and feel better I'm going
to change the max tokens into 150 going
to change this into GPT
40 I'm going to go to the transcriber
quickly check the settings there all
right so I think Nova V2 um is the best
model model here and with the voices I'm
going to choose 11
Labs all right and then choose
Sarah That's The Voice or markers right
here and then of course the newest best
version is 11 Labs flash so make sure
that you choose the flash model uh v2.5
it sounds the best it has latency if you
check here the latency is around 725
milliseconds cost per minute is around
12 cents and in some cases you can
actually go beyond below that 12 cents
now keep in mind this is only for the
web version you also have twio and phage
which will incase increase your latency
but still it sounds really really good
all right background sound I always like
putting on uh office sounds we have some
office sounds in the background like
turning those
on and then uh buct uation boundaries
which is something that's going to be
added to the orchestration model for
making it sound better I always add
commas and what is it actually called in
English uh Point commas period commas
not quite sure
semicolons I'm I'm Dutch so these are
some of the small things that I I run
into um filler injection enabl this
determines whether fillers are
injected oh yes this is something I like
to turn turn on back channeling of
course that's sounds better make the B
say words like H or yeah or some things
that make it sound more natural not
static like an actual robot I don't um
um change any of these settings at least
for
now quickly publish that then we go to
functions um enable end call function of
course you want your agent to be able to
um end the call now one thing that I've
noticed and that's really important to
remember when you want this is something
that many people are running into with
their agents and that
is sometimes when you're calling with
your agents and you're saying goodbye
and the agent has said goodbye the agent
still doesn't hang up the phone it just
leaves on the phone and it doesn't hang
up um and you can say goodbye or have a
good day or speak to you soon like 100
times but it will still not uh pick uh
hang up the phone and the reason for
that is it's supposed to call an actual
function in order to end the
conversation so the quickest way you
could do that is by literally putting
this exact sentence into the uh into the
prompt which
is end the call when
the when it seems apprpriate or the
caller has said
goodbyes by using the
and go function if you put something
like this into the system prompt it's
going to use that function way more
reliably and it will actually be able to
hang up the phone instead of having it
leave uh stay on the phone for another
10 minutes all right so that's something
that we've now turned on D keypad is
something I'm going to make a video on
in the future audio recording we're
going to turn that on Just for um
reviewing our agent
later um
don't change any of these but I do like
to turn on smart end pointing right here
takes care of most of those uh settings
um and then with client messages we're
going to turn all of these off because
client messages are actually only used
when you're uh building your agent
inside um of a web application but in
this case of course we're going to be
attaching it to our um phone number so
we're not going to need any of these to
be sent as messages so you can turn all
of these off honestly I'm not sure I
don't think it even matters if you turn
them off was quickly have to refresh it
or else we're not going to see the
difference but not sure if it even uh
matters if you turn them off but since
we don't need them it's going to make it
a
lot this is a small problem with vapy
that some of you guys might also be
running into we updating your vapy it
seems like it's not
updating so vapy is is a developer first
platform which means that it's not
paying that much attention to actually
people logging in they're more concerned
with people using the apis like we're
going to do right now um so we can
actually do this later I'll show you how
to do that all right so we've built our
agent and now of course we need to turn
that into a transient agent so what
we're going to do is we're going to go
here going to go to API Keys open that
in new tab and then also click here and
then go to a API documentation now your
API key I've always said I've said this
too many times is something you don't
want to share with anyone but um because
it's used to interact with any part of
your
system so I'm going to keep that off
camera for
now uh well in this case it doesn't
really matter anyway because this is an
uh
separate
um this is a separate environment
organization of course so I'll just show
you what that looks like and then I'll
delete the uh Delete the API key later
so again like And subscribe um allowed
Origins uh any origin do we need to add
an origin this token will be restricted
to
only these URLs okay we don't need to
add that and we don't actually need to
add an agent as well transient assistant
yes yes perfect great private token all
right so I can actually show you guys
what those tokens look like all right so
um you could just also um use this one
if you go here and just copy ID this is
the one that you're going to need or you
can add a new ID you don't need the
public one you need the uh private one
just click copy ID right here go to um
get
assistant click play right
here um oh that's the bar token add your
bar token right here and then of course
find your ID so this is your agent if
you go to platform assistant assistant
ID copy that ID go over here and put it
in here do remove the ID that you see
right here um you only need the actual
ID not the ID like the two letters need
to remove that and this is of course
your bar token you can click done here
click Send request there oh agent not
found that's strange let's
see assistant ID
bar
token let's see what went wrong
here I might have been in a different
organization or I did not save that par
token well in that case you can see that
if you uh just choose this private key
copy that and then go to assistant and
copy your assistant ID if you put those
in then you get the correct request all
right so we're going to have to Quick
this is your agent so this is what
transion agent is is now the agent is
outside of V of course this agent unless
it's on the server can't do anything but
this is the configuration of your agent
this is how your agent is saved in uh
vapy is the configuration now of course
this is not something we can actually
work with yet we have to format it a
little bit so what we go what we do is
we do this and then
assistance and then do this or actually
do this
and then put these in between
quotes all right so I'll try to see if I
can make that a little easier for you
guys of course there's going to be
blueprints in the member platform just
to make it easier for you guys at first
you're going to add curly brackets like
this then you're going to type uh add
quotes like this they you're going to
type
assistant and then put um
put this right
here and then if you so if you have this
exactly right this like this don't worry
about the errors yet so this is Json
editor online.org there's also something
that I add to the blueprints where I
edit pretty much anything it will tell
you about can help you format it it can
tell you that the um Json is
misconfigured but if you type exactly
this so these Cy brackets and then
between quotes and then
I'm not even sure what that symbol is
called um colons not sure but um yeah
adding this
symbol then you can go back to this page
CL uh click copy to clipboard go in here
and then add it right there and then if
once you've added that you can click
this middle symbol and it's going to
make it look much more pretty and then
the one to the left to make it all uh to
the left you get this right here so this
is now your agent configuration this is
now a transient agent just have to
remove some details so ID and or ID need
to be
removed
um let's see the creation dates help me
find it okay so this one has to be
removed is serve URL Secrets plus the
comma that you see right here also has
to be removed and then the creation date
has to be removed let's see where that
is cre add and updated ads both have to
be removed and now you have a value a
valid assistant they can actually use
with
uh
um with VY then remove all of the client
messages and then remove the status
update and hang but they keep the
function call all right
perfect so this is the agent we're going
to use remove all the client messages
remove the server messages and that
created a dat in the org ID and the ID
and the server secret all right so this
is what it's supposed to look like and
then of course you can edit the prompt
and you can edit the first message is
going to speak and you can edit this
voice ID by either looking it up in the
voice library with that or um redoing
building this assistant basically right
so this is going to be our transient
agents that we're going to use to pick
up calls and to execute calls so first
of all we're going to build a server URL
I always like to uh make one scenario
called server URL and this is going to
receive all of the messages from VAP so
um the next part we're going to build is
in make.com so you go to make.com make a
free account again as you can see I made
an organization with a free tier so that
means that you can just use a free
account for everything we're building in
this video um you can go to scenarios
create a new
scenario click that module here and then
either type in web hook or find web hook
there and then create um add custom web
hook and it should seem something like
this you can just call this server URL
it's going to look like this and then um
yeah this is the place where all of the
messages and information from vapi are
going to be sent to All right so this is
the web hook now let's see what are we
going to build all right so first we're
going to test if our transient agent
actually works so we're not going to do
anything exciting we're just going going
to add a sleep module right here to give
us some time to observe what is
happening so just type in sleep and then
make it 5 Seconds click web hook
response so type in web hook response so
not um custom web hook or anything like
that just a web response and then reply
with this so put the entire thing that
we've built right here put that in the
body and basically don't change anything
else and then click save and then it's
going to look um something like this so
basically what is happening is we're
going to um reply to vapi so vapi is
going to send messages to our server and
one of them is going to be an assistant
request we're going to reply to that
assistant request with the assistant um
Json that we've built right here our
transient assistant and that's the
assistant that's going to pick up the
phone all right so there's two ways uh
one thing that we actually have to do is
add our phone number of course now also
one thing that you can basically do is
not going to do it right uh now because
perhaps in a future video we're going to
we're going to use this one you can
actually remove or delete this entire
agent because we're not using that one
anymore we're using the Json one so we
only use this to build the agent but
after that we can basically just delete
it I just deleted it anyway and then uh
and it doesn't really matter for the
rest of the video all right so um phone
numbers um there's two ways of buying
phone numbers as I've said you can buy a
phone number right here but I like to
buy phone numbers in twio it gives you a
lot more room and flexibility on um
regions of phone numbers for example I'm
in the Netherlands so I'm going to buy a
Dutch phone number so what you're going
to do is go to console. twilio.com or
twilio.com make an account there you
even get free credits with twio but I'm
not quite sure if you can actually buy a
phone number with free credits if you do
have to add your credit card details
there's no way around it you're going to
have to uh add them and then buy a phone
number this case I've bought a Dutch
phone number and then you can find it
under phone numbers and then active
numbers and you can use this to find it
so for example phone
numbers buy a phone number and then if
you want to find your phone number that
you've just bought go to phone numbers
and then active numbers and then find
the phone number that you've bought and
then this is what it's going to look
like now this is the phone number that I
actually want to add to vapi so I'm
going to copy the entire phone number
and it has to be formatted like this so
there's also a difference formatting
somewhere around here with like in
between brackets that's not the one
you're going to need you're going to
want to add uh grab this one which is
e164 formatted go in here go and import
and then add it right there and then of
course you need your um developer kind
of password and um username in order to
make that connection now of course this
is not your actual username and password
this is something that is generated for
you once you build your account and you
can find it at Account dashboard or just
typing in console console. tdo.com and
copying your first your account Sid
right here putting that there and then
your authentication token now this is of
course something that I have to quickly
do offscreen because that's um protected
token that I can't show you guys but um
yeah that's the one that you're going to
add and then for the label you can do
anything um YouTube video that's that's
what I'm going to call it and then
you're going to click import from
twio and what um vapi actually does is
it finds that phone number in twio so if
we go back here or actually go
here it finds the phone number and it
changes this incoming web hook URL so
what this means is when when someone
calls that phone number twio is going to
send a message to vapi and now we've set
up vapy where um vapy sends a message to
our make.com com
server um okay what's the best way to
explain this twio gets a call and twio
asks vapi how am I supposed to pick up
the phone and then vapi has the phone
number but it says I'm not quite sure I
don't have an agent right here but I do
have a server attached which is our
make.com scenario I'll ask the server
how I'm supposed to pick up the phone
and then the message the request comes
in through here and then this is what we
tell to pick up the phone with so that's
what we're going to do right now and
there's only one small tweak that we
have to add is if we go here to our
make.com workflow click copy address to
flip clipboard go back in here go to
settings and then
this is something you have to change
into your own uh webbook quickly I'm
going to have to load this up all
right all right so where you going to do
is you're going to go to settings and
then scroll down here to server URL and
change this server URL into well your
own server
URL if we refresh the page it should be
the make.com webbook that we have right
here so let's see yes now it's the make
the comb book 1j
WSS let's see yes 1j WSS all right
perfect so that means that if you have
not attached an agent to this phone
number so don't attach an agent to the
phone number you just bought and
imported this should be empty then it's
going to say there's no assistant
attached I'll ask the server how to pick
up the phone and then reply with this so
basically this means that we should
already be able to actually make a call
and it the um vapi should pick up the
phone with our transient agents so uh
yeah let's try that out right now all
right so you guys already know this but
I'm recording all of my videos with my
camera uh or with my phone and my
provider doesn't allow me to make calls
to this kind of phone number so if
there's any Dutch people watching we
actually found a solution to calling
with these um computer generated uh
computer numbers here in the Netherlands
so if you're uh interested in that send
send me or send a team a message we can
help you out with uh with setting that
up we use platforms like did logic twio
and telx telx is amazing platform for
connecting to your voice agents through
Sip and getting access to around I think
it was 200 different countries of phone
numbers so is the perfect platform to
work with we have a great solution for
that so if you're curious send us a
message and um yeah we'll uh hop into a
meeting but for now I'm going just for
the purpose of this video uh us people
and Canadian people are not going to
have this problem so don't worry about
it if you're uh in US and Canada and
many other countries also don't have
this problem but for now let's um
actually make that call with my uh with
my mobile phone and what should happen
is that if we turn this on a request
should be sent send to our make.com
webbook and it's going to um pick up the
call with that agent so first we're
going to have to turn this on of course
all right and then we're going to call
that number so I got a keypad and
then 970
1024
531 perfect
hello couldn't get assistant either said
the assistant I okay couldn't get
assistant that's interesting so that
means that something went wrong now
let's see we did get an assisted given a
a correct reply but something went wrong
here so let's quickly see what happened
so we did reply with an assistant it
gave a 200 status which means that our
Json was correct so we don't actually
have to worry about our Json we just
have to worry about what we replied with
but a great thing is um vapi after
you've sent the first reply vapi
actually tells you what went wrong so in
this case assistant request return no
assistant so it runs two times as you
just saw the first one is an assistant
request so the type is assistant request
and we apparently replied with a wrong
uh phone number and then the second one
is going to be the status update so the
status update in this case is the call
ended and it's going to tell us why the
call ended let's
see couldn't get assistant um request
did not return one so we did return
assistant but we're quickly going to
have to look at the
documentation I think in order to see
what we
wrong so we're going to go here that's a
great way for you guys to also get
familiar with okay um how does that
actually work building agents transient
agents and getting familiar with that um
API
so let's see if we go in
here Pi
documentation go to server
URL server
events and then go in here this is what
we have to reply with so this is a
transcent agent and apparently we did
something wrong but the agent's not
telling us so this payload is not
correct so if we go here assistant
perhaps it's because it's a capital a
all right so the solution can be as
simple as that this a has to be a
lowercase a so this is something I
actually should have known but it's a
great uh case in point you are going to
run into problems when you're building
your own systems of course there a big
help watching videos like this but
actually being able to troubleshoot your
agents or troubleshoot the things that
you're building is going to be the most
powerful element so that's why I keep uh
bits and pieces like these in so they
can actually see ah okay so this is one
thing that um you might run into and how
do you troubleshoot it in this case
really quickly um we reped with your
system request here then we got a reply
from vappy of why did the agent not pick
up the phone in this case it didn't tell
us much it only said that um the server
did not reply with an assistant and
that's because we have to reply with an
lowercase assistant like it's to
completely different things because
that's just how computers work you have
to reply with a lowercase assistant and
not um lize assistance all right so we
changed that um we made that quick fix
and so uh if you were to make another
call the agent should probably pick up
the phone let's try that
out hello this um is Mary from Mary's
Dental how can I assist you today hi
Mary you sound like um you know what
you're doing how are you
oh you know just hanging around in the
toothy business I'm all ears well
figuratively speaking how can I help you
today okay to be very honest that is not
the best voice we could have picked I
just grabbed a quick random voice
there's a lot of voices that actually
work well but um yeah so as you can see
that worked quite uh quite well our
agent picked up the phone so that's the
easiest and quickest way to get a
transient agent is by building one in
vapi and then editing it in a Json
editor removing those things so remove
the org ID the ID the secret URL
removing that comma above that secret
URL as I showed you um the created ad
dates and um of course adding a
lowercase assistant so basically what
that's going to look like is
this let's
see um right
all right so you're going to have this
build exactly this and then put the
agent that I showed you right here
inside of these brackets and then it
should work with the lowercase a all
right so we built our transient agent
now one thing we're going to have to do
is make sure that it only uh
gets
um assistant requests for now that's the
only Parts we're going to work with so
we're going to make another quick call
and get that data so we're going to run
this module make another quick
call we're not even going to wait for it
for to reply so we're just going to do
this right here and then we're going to
go here and then type is going to be
equal to
assistant
request all right
perfect so this is going to be the type
and it's going to be assistant request
which means that only assistant requests
are going to be able to go through this
link I remove the Sleep module because
we don't need that right now and um yeah
so this is the place where we're going
to build all of the other functions I'm
going to go uh switch back to my uh
phone and see you guys in a bit all
right so the next part we're going to
build of course is the end of call
report we're going to want to know after
a call has ended what happened during
that call we want to track all of those
calls um what was the reason the call
ended for example keeping track of all
of those things we're going to build
that in air table of course but first
we're going to update our make.com web
uh scenario so the first branch is going
to be assistant request but another
thing we're going to need is the router
now don't worry about this uh you might
have already seen it in the introduction
or on the member platform I'm going to
add and share a detail a blueprint with
you guys that you guys can update and um
um make entirely into your own all right
so what we're going to do is copy this
right here and remove that so this is
how I built that if you want to keep the
filter but put something in between
add a module behind it and then uh clone
it and then put it behind that and then
we'll keep that uh filter uh right oh
but this is actually not something we
want to do because we want to filter
that Branch right here so ignore what I
just said it's true what I just said but
not exactly what we're looking for right
now all
right message type equal to assistant
request there we go this is the filter
we're going to build assistant
request all
right and then remove it right here so I
can remove all of
this so this is going to be an assistant
request this is the assistant that we're
going to reply with and then this is the
branch for the end of call reports we're
actually going to go here and then type
end of call report because that's what
it's going to look like and of call
report
so what vapi does is at the end of every
call is going to give a summary of that
call and um what did it cost and how
long did it take and who called and all
of these things what is the recording
URL all those things will be um given by
uh vapy at the end of the call and the
way we're going to use that is we're
going to go to uh air table so again
this is another part of the agent that
we're going to build the text tag is uh
vapy make.com twio and a table so you're
going to go to airtable.com I've made a
free account which means that also um
everything I'm going to do in here is
something you can do absolutely for free
um and of course if you want to scale to
like thousands of calls or hundreds of
calls you might have to um invest in
some parts of this teex stack but I
think it's the cheap cheapest check the
cheapest teex stack on the market right
now especially for beginners who want to
make this uh work and make an agent of
their own so we we're going to go in
here and then create and then um start
from scratch and we're going to build an
air table base so actually can I make
this a little easier for you guys um
yeah so you're in an air table this is
your plan and you click create and then
you have a base like this um and then
you can actually remove all of these
fields so that status one delete that
one assign e delete this one delete this
one we're going to build it complet
completely enter our own and then double
click this one and turn this
into
call uh ID so I like to give an ID to
every call it allows me to identify them
to search them to keep track of them and
it's just basically good uh good
policy so we can actually make this
something attached call
ID actually like to turn add this to it
as well okay so this just use lowercase
this is the easiest way to actually if
you make your variables kind of a static
format it's going to help you in
development but it's more high level you
don't have to worry about that right now
just turn this into call ID type um
formula right here you want to make this
into this type of field and then type
record ID it's already going to show
show up right here do add another
bracket or else it's not going to work
and then you're going to get supposed to
get an example right right there all
right so this is what it's going to look
like call ID formula record ID and then
right here what do we want to keep track
of
um phone
number type in phone number so this is
the phone number of the person who
called of course um next one is going to
be
call
summary and then make this a long
text what else do we need to track um
ended ended reason it's a great thing
with um vapy it always tells you what
was the reason that the call ended and
we can keep track of that so let's see I
usually do single select for this so
there's a quick trick that you can use
in order to get all of those it's
something I actually got from um tyon
Miller who whom I also did um a video or
an interview with is if you go to vapi
docs vapy documentation we going to go
in here of course all of these things
are in the blueprints if we go to API
reference if they're not there um make
sure to send me a message through
Instagram or through um the Discord from
the community and then I'll update it
with all the details so if we go in here
and then go to server
messages there should be a giant list or
just type it in right here
ended call ended reason there should
somewhere be an entire list of reasons
call ended okay let's just put this
into
um let's just put this into Chad
jpt and see if Chad jpt can help us make
this into one giant list I like to do
that base that right
here um all right
just going to go in here and ask CH GPT
just uh 01 Mini model put all of these
oh let's actually just do the GPT 40
model put all of these um and go reasons
without
description below each other in a bullet
list
all right perfect so these are all the
reasons that the call ended and those
are of course reasons that we're going
to save in our uh platform I am curious
because it does give
us let's see ended call ended reason it
gives us something like this which I
find peculiar pipeline error with some
asterisk right there I'm quickly going
to check if that's
correct oh yeah I guess it
is various error
codes all right just going to put it in
there I haven't noticed any problems
with that yet so this's a really neat
trick that you can use and should
probably remember in air table if we go
to air table we're still trying to build
this one we're going to first choose
single line text as the type so this is
the um where you're going to call this
field and this is what type of field is
it and we're going to choose single line
text for now and then copy all of
this let's see what it looks like in
that HTML viewer
first all right so this is
okay you can just you can ignore what I
just did and then paste all of them in
here expand the table do make sure that
it exp expands the table and then we
have all of them here and then we can
turn this into single select options so
type single
select and the great thing here is it's
going to add it to the list of options
in that single select so that's just a
great way of getting all of those
options and limiting those options to
specific variables in this case the
ended reason so everything we're going
to collect after every call for now is
the call ID phone number call summary
and added reason there's a bunch of
things you can add if you go in here and
then see API reference and then um get
call here's an example not everything
everything is included but this is an
example of all the things that you're
going to get at the end of the call but
we don't need that
necessarily oh one thing that we might
need is yeah this is something you're
actually going to want to keep track of
so I'll show you guys what what this is
this is kind of a thing in the middle
but it's incredibly powerful if you know
how to uh how to use it and it's called
metadata so basically what metadata is
it does absolutely nothing but allows
you to add some information to an agent
that you can use later on so if we give
this data this agent the following
metadata um metad
data um let's see this should
work metadata and
then
assistant
ID is going to
be uh um well in this case we can just
do a random
ID let's
see where was it oh there we are um just
do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 all right so this
will allow us to keep track of this
agent now every time I change something
to my transient agent I like to make
another call just to check if it still
works so let's run another call just for
now and then uh check if it still works
all right so so grab my phone again and
quickly going to call the agents just to
see if everything we've changed is it
going to work all right so calling the
agent
now hi Mary can you uh can you hear
me loud and clear like a dentist's drill
how can I help you today like a dentist
drill okay that's great to here um thank
you
bye-bye all right so quickly hung up the
phone so the agent still works that's
great to hear and we should be getting
an end of call report in a bit so this
is status update and then in a bit we're
going to get the end of call report so
that we can actually check if that
filter is working as well um let's see
if we're getting the end of car or was
this already the end of call
report oh that's already the end of car
report let's see I think it did go
through the filter but of course there's
nothing there there there's no reason
for it to go through that filter going
to go back in here here all right so
here we are again um back um in the
workflow the agent still works so that's
great to hear and then of course we also
get the metadata from the agents so what
we're going to do is go back in here uh
reason and then
assistant add a field and then single
line text and then assistant ID so these
are all the fields we're going to
populate at the end of the call so what
we're going to do is add an aor table
module go here click air table click um
create a record and then we have to
create a connection now the way that you
can make connections in air table is by
connecting it through an authentication
token so in this case we're going to use
an air table token or
key right here we're going to call this
um subscribe again all right
perfect so here we are and then of
course we're going to go back to our air
table we're going to click here and then
click um Builder Hub so you're going to
click your account click Builder Hub
this is going to show all of our
accounts of course because it just made
an organiz organization for this what
you're going to do is on the tab for
personal access tokens you're going to
create a new personal access token
create token right here uh and the name
is going to be air table um
YouTube video about building awesome
agents
in
2025 perfect uh you can basically name
this anything doesn't really matter you
can add all of the Scopes um so Scopes
basically what they are is they limit
the ability of your um token so if
you're bigger bigger organization or
there's some sensitive content in your
um bases or um you're working with
Freelancers or people that shouldn't get
access to all of your bases then well
this is what you're going to uh want to
do for now I'm just going to grab that
one
specific base that we built on title
base create token and then this is going
to be our token and then we can use that
to access That Base so copy that token
and then paste it in here personal
access token and don't worry about this
API keys will be deprecated by the end
of January 2024 that's only for people
who are still using API keys
they're currently using personal access
tokens you can even forget that I said
that nothing changes for you if you just
follow along step by step all right
click save and it's going to make that
connection is going to allow us to
actually connect to our um air table
base go in here click on our base and
then which is the table that we're going
to change oh let's actually rename that
table just to make it look
better so go to our air table base
on tile
base and then call this the calls
history or just
calls perfect go back in
here um reload that those
tables this is actually something you're
going to have to do if you're importing
the blueprint is um reloading all of
these um um fields and tables because
right now they're Mis referencing the ID
all right so we're going to have to
actually get that data as an example so
these are all of the things that we have
to populate but as you can see we still
have information about the assistant
request but there's many things that are
going to go through this server URL and
we actually have to get that one very
specific end of call report so all of
the things that we want from the call
are not in here so what we're going to
do is call the agent one more time and
try to see if we can get that end of
call report data all right so here we
are again at the webcan and uh calling
my agents now to see if we can get get
that end of call
report hello this arm is Mary from
Mary's Dental how can I assist you today
all right so I can immediately hang up
the phone so that we can get the end of
call report and it's going to load up
right here and now we have the end of
call report so we can actually work with
that data so if I click our um air table
module again and see here you're going
to see type and of call report so that's
great that's exactly what we want to
work with now I'm going to give you one
huge advantage in building agents this
is something you really have to know
because it gives you it makes building
agents 100 times easier what we're going
to do is click that web hook right here
click on this little symbol right there
and then click download in
output um uh download output data or
bundles and then what we're going to do
is go to let's see if I can find it here
Postman I'll add the link in the
description or in the blueprints if you
really want to know and I forgot to add
it for some reason you can send me a
message again and um I'll share this
with you but basically you can go to
web.
postman. and then you grab all of this
I'll quickly put it there for
now um or rather you can go in here so
web. postman. goco make a new API
request so actually I'll show you what
that looks like if you're here so web.
postman. Co it's going to look like this
new request turn this into post so we're
going to make a post API
request all of this you're going to
copy and you're going to put it in the
body right here so you're going to go
buddy raw and then put everything in
here and I think you should be able to
remove that no just keep it exactly as
is don't edit anything then go back to
your
make.com remove this copy
that um this right here copy the Ser or
the web hook go back to postman put that
web hook right here and then every time
you're sending data so I'll quickly show
you what that looks like the phone
number of course is something we're
going to populate with the phone number
that we just got so we go to the
assistant uh no not the assistant the
customer so theer customer's phone
number you also have phone number right
here don't be tricked by that because
that's your own phone number you're
going to want to get the phone number
from your uh from the person who called
the agent so that's the phone number of
course um call
summary let's see um a summary of the
call you can find
that here or rather one thing that we
can do is let's just add the transcript
here so no summary just a transcript
messages transcript it's just right
there and it reason is going to be this
customer ended call and then assistant
ID is of course going to be in your
assistant and metadata so if you see
this right here go to
assistant go to metadata and then
assistant ID perfect that way you can
keep track of your uh assistance save
that here and then I'm going to show you
that if you were to run that information
again but now through Postman so not
even making a call we don't have to call
the entire agent we can just do this
then we're going to get the exact same
information and as you can see we can
just work with that as if we just made a
call so that's one very important thing
to keep in mind uh every time you want
to test your agent this is what you're
going to want to do in order to not have
to actually make those calls just to
test your workflows all right back with
you guys in a bit all right so here we
are again um back at building the uh the
agent so now we have one branch
assistant requests and one branch of end
of call report we get all of that data
so now we can make the and build the
agent way more extensive than we
currently have so right now it's going
to save all of that data for our agent
and in order to test of course we can
make all of this empty and as I just
showed you we don't even have to make
the call all of that data that we got
from uh the server URL we can just send
through Postman right now
so our scenario is turned on and we're
going to simulate vapi sending us that
data so we're going to click Send
it's going to run through automation
it's going to take the end of call
report Branch it's going to populate all
those fields in the air table records
and this is what we get we get the
assistant ID the call summary which is
the transcript and then phone number and
call ID there's a whole list of things
you can you can add to that so for
example if you just were to browse
browse through here we can see exactly
what we want to add so for example we go
to message type and of carport we don't
necessarily have to add that started at
ended at that might be interesting to uh
to include so let's do that if we go
here end it
at single for now I just prefer making
this a single line of text you can
always switch back into something else
later um and of course duplicate
field
um
started
at Perfect
let's switch these two just to make it
look bit
cleaner and then what the only thing
you're going to have to do is go back to
your um air table module click refresh
and then it's going to find those fields
that you can add data to and then you
can populate them so if we go back here
start it at end it at wait no end it
at and then we can test it again if we
go in here remove that and then send
another request we should be getting
another row so there we go got all of
that data and you can do this well
basically indefinitely all of the
variables that you're going to want into
in your air table you can just look at
this um output right here and put it in
so duration in milliseconds for example
we can go in
here uh
duration
milliseconds and then we can actually
make that number so that's always a
number this looks a bit better make that
zero decimals so decimal place is zero
because of course milliseconds will not
have decimals create
field and then this is another field
that we can populate go back in here
click
refresh and then scroll down to the
latest field and then
add let's
see duration in milliseconds right there
now of course what else do we want to
add we want to add the um cost so the
total cost so let's see I think it's in
artifact messages well just type in
cost let's see cost total cost is about
four half a cent so that's not a high
cost but of course the call is very
brief it's just a cost call for testing
the agent so then we're going to go back
in
here type cost or rather total cost
because there's a lot of things you can
calculate with cost of course but total
cost and then um make this into a
currency and then let's see no don't do
this um for now the uh we're going to
use dollars two decimals or actually
let's make this many more decimals like
six decimals so you get very accurate
costs because of course this is all data
that we're going to use and then if we
go and remove this one delete call send
another request all of that data will be
left loed in oh of course we haven't
populated this yet so if we go back here
refresh we have still have to add the
data to the fields so if we go to total
cost cost here we did add it here but we
didn't save the scenario yet so if you
click save and then save then remove
this and test it
again
send it should run it again and all of
those fields will be populated exactly
like we needed to perfect and then of
course if many calls were made then it
sends in the same data and you get all
of these calls so just for now we can
actually make this into something we can
work with to make the air table bit a
bit more extensive so if we go in here
we're going to change this call type and
end of call type this one and just to
give us some more interesting data and
then turn this into into like seven and
then this into
five and this is a complete
dollar and this was like
$3 or $5 and this is a very short call
so it's about 100th of a cent or
something like
that perfect and then these durations
are like this and this so just this is
just some dummy or template uh
um data that we're going to use because
the next thing I'm going to show you is
how to build interfaces so if we click
interface right here start building
build an interface and then just some
data like right
here let's see um do you see a graph
somewhere I think this is good enough
next um let's see find dashboard click
dashboard right here click next and then
we build it on top of the calls and then
if we go here so this is the calls or
calls data count number of calls so an
interface is what you build um on top of
your air table in order to build um
something that
you it's an easy way to interact with
your data and your database so a
dashboard is going to give you all of
the graphs and all of the um numbers of
your data like number of calls total
cost all of these things something like
a form allows you to add data in a way
that's more user friendly um there's a
100 things you can add to an interface
just to make it a little bit easier to
understand for the purpose of this video
um we're going to just add one single um
dashboard a very quick very easy
dashboard so um you already get some
preconfigured um things added to your
agents so in this case count and uh um
reason call ended so customer ended call
happened four times um customer busy
Happened One Time pipeline error so
these are already things you can uh play
around with for now let's just add
another account just to show you guys
what this looks
like and then we're going to call this
um total cost so th this is the element
that you're going to see in the air
table interface uh this this is usually
what you invite your clients to in order
to see their agent but also if you're
building an agent for yourself this is
where you're going to get all of that
data and build that dashboard for you
for yourself so total cost we're going
to add filter buy oh we're not
necessarily filter anything we don't
have to filter anything here we just
have the summary and then total
cost and then summary type is sum
and then what this does is we called it
total cost so that's just a label to see
what is this about then uh we chose
summary and then the field is of course
total cost we want to calculate the
total cost and the summary type is sum
so if we were to change this into Min it
would be the lowest number Max would be
the highest number and average would be
the average total cost um or the average
cost and but in this case we're just
going to get total cost of the agent so
this is an uh all of the cost of all of
the calls so total cost total total
cost all of the costs for all of the
calls in the database are going to be
this exact figure and then if we go here
and turn this into average for example
we're going to see the average cost per
call so if you were to calculate this
and divide it by eight it's going to
give exactly this if we publish it
publish
interface this is what you're going to
see and if you click share and then
invite by link or invite guest users or
share publicly or invite by email you
can invite your clients into this
dashboard and they can see all of the
data that you've built into graphs and
they find important in order to build
their uh to track their agents all right
so we going to go back
to uh editing view
data all right so quickly to recap what
have we built we've built a transient
agent that can pick up the phone and
we've built an end of call report that
populates this air table table and then
gives a userfriendly interface to your
client or to yourself to keep track of
all of that data and all of those calls
but of course what is the purpose of a
transient agent is if you're just going
to pick up the phone with the exact same
agent that just made the that just made
the call or or that you just made in
vapi so what we're going to do is give
this agent some memory about the calls
that are made and how are we going to do
that of course we're going to have to
keep track of our customers and we're
going to do that with the end of call
report so we're going to add another
table and it's going to be called
customers right so this is the second
table that we're going to make just
clicking add and then start from scratch
calling a customer and then again we
have to remove all of these we NE not
necessarily all of yeah let's just
remove all of these and then we can add
our own tables later what what this
customer table is for is we're going to
keep track of everyone who's called our
agent and of course we want to be able
to identify them by phone number and
then give our agent the history of those
calls by their end of call reports all
right so what we're going to do is we're
going to um turn this into customer
ID and then again go to this go choose
formula type in record ID don't forget
to add this so if you just type
literally this it's going to to show you
the ID of every field here and again
just the same with this one call ID
customer ID so the customer
ID these are all of the fields of the
customers and then of course this one is
going to be phone number we're going to
identify them by phone
number right here and then um logs this
the most easy thing that we're going to
build just phone number and
logs and then we can give our agents
some history about these calls so what
we're going to do is go to
clone and then we're going to wait not
that's not how we're going to build this
how we're going to build this um so what
we're going to do is with every end of
call report we're currently keeping
track of every call and putting them
into the calls table but we also want
the end of call report to put all data
inside of the customer table so that's
what we're going to do right now we're
going to going to click add another
module we're going to click um search
records but if we're going to do that we
first have to check does that customer
already exist there's no reason to add
um another customer if they're already
in that database you might as well just
update those logs and add those details
instead of having duplicates of many
customers with the same phone number so
what we're going to do is add an module
and then specifically the search record
so a create record but a search records
module click on it choose your base
again in this case it's called entitle
base you don't have to worry about
changing it because if you click right
here it doesn't find your base based on
um um title it finds it based on ID so
if I were to change this into for
example F test YT sub oh YT sub for
example just anything I want then it's
not going to affect its connection
because it's still connected through the
same ID all right so test
sub we're going to choose the customer
table and then of course that's the
table that we just made sort don't worry
about that view don't worry about that
either don't add any of these because if
you don't select any of these you will
get all of them as it says right here
leave empty retrieve all fields
limit should only be one and the formula
should be exactly this so cly brackets
and then go in here copy this phone
number Lally what this is called go in
here equals in quotes and then right
here between those quotes we're going to
get the phone number from the customer
from the end of call report and
basically what this does this formula
looks at all of the records that have
this specific phone number
now if I were to type this in right now
plus
31 all right then it should give us
total number of bundles zero so we can
use that as a filter of course so that
means if we add a router right here
which is this module right here we can
do two things so um no customers
found or customer found those are the
two options that we have customer found
right here
perfect so the first branch is this so
total number of bundles the top one
right here equal to zero because of
course if it if it didn't find anything
the total number of bundles total number
of Records is zero so no customers found
total number of bundles zero the uh
bottom one is of course going to be
total number of B bundles not equal to
zero because if it's not equal to zero
it must at least be um one and that
means that a record was actually found
so in the first version no customers
found we're going to create a
record we're going to add that customer
to that
base just like the cost table we're just
going to populate all those fields in
this case we're just going to only add
the phone
number you can add anything you want as
I just showed you by just um looking at
all these variables and adding a field
but for now we're just going to add the
phone number and logs
all
right and for now the only log we're
going to use is the
transcript call transcripts or actually
just add the transcript right here
perfect oh and to make it even easier
for the agent we're actually going to do
this right here
so um
transcript for call on and then format
date
now and then y y y y mm d d
hhmm
z and then
UTC all right this looks way more
complicated than you guys think is even
necessary but the reason that I do this
is with every log we also want so every
time in the future with the agent that
we're we're going to build the agent
picks up the phone we're going to add
these logs to its prompt one thing
that's very important to keep in mind is
that we do need to tell the agent when
was this transcript when was this call
executed and that's what we're doing
right here so we use the now variable
gives the current time but we want the
current time in a certain format so we
want y y y which is years months dates
hour minutes and then Z means time zone
so it has all of the information that
needs in order to um to keep that log so
in the first version we're creating a
new agent a new customer so that means
there's no logs we can just do it like
this but with the second
version we're just creating so air table
get a
record we're updating an existing
customer what we're going to do is f go
test YouTube
sub click the customers table and then
choose record ID so the ID that you see
right here just ID
save all
right oh no not get a record sorry let's
redo that that's not right um we have to
update record that's
right update a
record
baseo test sub table
customers and then record ID is still
going to be this ID right here so not
this one do make sure it's not this one
it's supposed to be this one because
this is the customers and this is the
calls this one of course is going to be
the this one you don't even have to
populate this because that case it will
be the same it's just for your personal
reference and then this one is going to
be a little bit different so we do add
the exact same thing as the other one so
transcript call on so you can just go to
this one click uh do CR a select all of
them copy them and put them in here but
if we do this then we remove all of the
existing transcripts so what we're going
to do to fix this is add this right
here and
then
add the bundles that we got here so the
logs that we got here below it so that
means that with every new call the
existing logs are that we found in this
module are going to be added to the
bottom of this one so it keeps track of
all of those
and one more thing that we have to do of
course is the assistant request we have
to add that information into the
assistant request so what we're going to
do
is um let's see what's the smartest way
to do this we're going to add a
router and we're going to put this
here and
then is request we're going to add add
an air table module right there search
records so um this is the end of call
report branch and this is the assistant
request Branch if we go to the air table
right here for test sub we're going to
check with every assistant request if
that customer is already in our database
and if it is of course that means that
we're going to uh um give our agent some
information about them so going to go
back here phone number do this exact
same thing but then of course with
customers now we have to get the
assistant request information so going
to do another call or actually I think
it might be the exact same as the end of
call report
one let's see yeah I think it should be
so if we turn this put this in here I
think it should still work message
customer number I think this is right we
can remove this one all right so what
happens now is you get the assistant
request we're going to Surge for
customers and then if that total number
of bundles is equal to zero if we did
not find a customer in that base so no
customer found we don't have to add
anything to The Prompt because there's
nothing to add because we don't have any
history about this person so we can just
reply with the same um uh with the same
agent but if we did find a customer so
customer found
then um not equal to zero or equal to
one is also
possible save then we're going to have
to reply with something else so set
variable or rather let's use a Json
module for that
Json and then transform to Json let's
remove this one so that's the module
that you're going to want you're going
to type transform to Json so Json and
then transform to Json and then we're
going to go in
here copy this entire
thing put it in there and then also oh
make.com is kind of acting up again
seems all right so this is the prompt
that we give to the agent and we're
going to add something to the prompt and
that's logs the
person we have uh history with the
person who is calling
you here are the
logs there we
go here is their phone
number and then we also add their phone
number of course so phone number because
then the agent will know the phone
number and then we can also add it
here this is the phone number of the
color because of course the phone number
is not something you have to keep track
of the phone number is something we
always have because how is our agent
going to talk to someone if we don't
know their phone number and then we can
go here clone that one and then remove
this entire thing so with this one we
don't actually need it because it's
already in that prompt that we just made
and since it's an Json transform to Json
module we can actually remove the quotes
that you see right here which seems like
it would be wrong but since this module
already creates quotes around around our
prompt we can just do it like this so
now we've built an agent that can keep
track of all of the calls can um show
the calls data into a nice and neat
interface but also give the agent some
history about the caller every time it
picks up the phone so let's make an uh
make another call or two or three to
this agent and uh see how it works all
right so here we are again I'm going to
make a few calls um the first one is
going to go through this branch of
course and make a new call then here is
going to decide that that customer is
not found yet so we're not in the
customer's table yet so it's going to
create a new record after that I'm going
to make another call and it's going to
find that customer and pick up with the
ability to actually know um what we
talked about in the last call and then
after that call it's of course going to
update those records and add to the logs
so it has a more extensive logs and more
extensive history the next time we call
so I think this should uh work perfectly
fine let's uh let's try it
out hello this arm Miss Mary from Mary's
Dental how can I assist you today hi I
was wondering what do you guys
do hey we provide a range of dental
services to keep your smile sparkling
from cleanings and fillings to advanced
stuff like crowns and root canals what
can we uh help you with um yeah I don't
know quite for sure what you can help me
with I'm very scared of going to the
dentist but um is there any way that you
guys could go to my
home oh I totally am get the Jitters
unfortunately we don't do house calls
but you know what Dr Mary is actually I
have to go I'll uh call you guys back
later I'm really in a hurry I'll call
you back later
bye-bye thank you for in Mary's Dental
have a great day so that's great there's
one case in point where if you give it
that prompt of end call function it will
be able to predictably end that call so
as you can see it first it went up to
this branch and then it saw okay a new
customer so I populated the customer
field customer ID phone number and logs
and those logs should be added to the
next call so if I make another call it
should remember what we um discussed
just
now hello this is is Mary from Mary's
Dental how can I assist you today hi do
you remember what we talk uh talked
about oh hey yeah I remember you we
chatted about your um Dental Jitters and
home visits how can I help you this time
ready to take the plunge or should I
tell a joke to ease the dental nerves
well um actually that's quite funny that
you mentioned that um no what I wanted
to know is um who's the attending doctor
and um yeah does he have um good track
record ah you've got me on a subject I
love do Mary Smith she's The Mastermind
here at Mary's Dental she totally Aces
the gentle and friendly thing her
patients leave with smiles and uh no
regrets anything else I can uh do for
you maybe a little knock knock
joke um no no no not necessary uh thank
you
bye-bye thank you for contacting Mary's
Dental have a great day
perfect so now went to this one it got
the memory of course and now it's not
going to update the existing but it's
going to uh not going to create a new
one but it's going to update the
existing transcript so if we do this one
we're going to see it at a line here and
it should have an extensive history of
our call so if I were to call back our
agent should know all of the history of
all of our calls so let's try that
out hello this is Mary from Mary's
Dental how can I assist you today hi um
yeah I was wondering we we've had a few
calls today and could you remind me um
with every call um what we talked about
in the first and the second call and at
which times we
called oh for sure we've had a couple of
heart-to- heart chats in the first call
you are curious about our services and
asked if we um do house visits
unfortunately we don't but I mentioned
how gentle Dr Mary Smith is she's like a
tooth fairy in Disguise that chat was
around 2: or 6 a.m. in the second call
you uh were interested in Dr Smith's
track record and I sang her Praises of
course that was at 2:07 a.m. so what's
next anything else I can uh help with or
ready for a tooth Adventure tooth
Adventure um well yeah I'm I think I'm
excited about that I can't book anything
right now but I'll call you back
tomorrow thank you
bye-bye thank you for contacting Mary's
Dental have a great day
all right perfect so that worked uh
quite well it has extensive memory of
all of our calls one one thing to
actually keep in mind is um eventually
this is going to really add up if
there's people who call lots of times so
might want to change this into a summary
might want to add an openi module right
here that is actually going to summarize
the transcript instead of putting the
entire transcript there or use the
analysis report that is a feature of Vy
so this a more advaned versions of your
of your build this is how you can make
advanced memory in your uh in your
agents now one thing I also want to do
is add a tool because of course we want
to build an appointment setter that can
actually book meetings and that's what
we're going to do right now so we're
going to add a branch right here and of
course we're going to have to build a
tool and give that to our agents so
let's see what's the easiest way to do
that we're going to go um in
here create new tool so we're going to
go back to vapi this is just the easiest
way to quickly build something and then
turn into something transient we going
to click tool going to click um make
just make.com and then make that the web
hook of course going to go here this
going to be the web
hook yes and then click
save and then click next and then proper
so now come all of the data that we're
going to send to our server now of
course we're going to be um let's just
take the example of booking Dental
appointments we're going to have to get
some information so some things that
we're going to need are their phone
number so phone
number um this is the phone number of
the caller in e.164
format all
right and then what else do we need
we're going to need there
uh
name name of the actually it's better to
call them user because that's we're
working with the open AI mod model so
we're going to call them of the
user number of the user uh name of the
user name uh full name let's just make
this a full
name full
name full name of the user
save that and then of course add
properties and then add um
email email of the user perfect save uh
so phone number full name and email of
the user I think this is all we need oh
of course the date for um for the
meeting or for the appointments
appointment
date all right uh ISO 8601
formatted
date and let's see um how are we going
to format that I'll quickly see what
it's going to look like y y z all
right
um
formatted
date in
UTC perfect well this is this is is
basically enough if you put in UTC then
you can always um uh calculate it back
or calculate any way that you like so
phone number full name email and
appointment
date
um for the
appointment right perfect so this is the
agent that we're going to use and uh
what is your tool name let's call it
book
appointment use this tool to book
appointments for
[Music]
Mary's dental clinic all right click
next um let's just forget about these
messages so you can add messages for
start delay response success message
error message um don't worry about those
I think that the agent is actually
pretty good at coming up with their own
messages but if you want more control
about what the agent says when it's
going to execute a function you can uh
edit and update those
so yeah so let's actually turn this into
something transient we're going to go
back to vapi right here so the vapy docs
docs. vy. a and we're going to go
to create assistance get assistance now
go to
tools and then get a tool and then click
play right here enter the bar token
again of course let's see do we need to
add a add it here no okay this one's
already authenticated so let's just do
this one um again just adding your bar
token and you can uh make those calls
you should already have that um or if
you forgot how to do that if that's
removed you can go back to the beginning
of the video so get
tool and then copy this ID right here of
the tool we just made remove these two
letters send
request all right and this is going to
be the tool
right here so of course these for sure
have to be removed and then type is make
function is book appointments async is
there anything else we need to remove
here um or ID can be
removed um server URL is okay timeout
seconds 30 seconds that's okay async is
false um yes so that means that we're
going to send um reply right so if you
do that if you remove the things that I
just removed then this is what it's
going to look look like and then of
course we're going to add that to our
agents so the way we're going to do that
is we're going to go in
here and blow
model let's see where we supposed to add
that I'll quickly have a
look um create
call create assistant let's look at that
example so if we go here create
assistant we can give it tool
tools
tools all
right and where is that knowledge base
model is exactly below model and then
type transfer okay
perfect all right so if we go in
here
model model is GPT 40 and the tool is
going to be this one
so tools
and then this is going to be an array
it's just something you have to know is
it going to be an error or array or
something
different there if we go in here this
should work but of course this is
something that we have to test in order
to make sure that actually does work
right now it's just guessing work
so yes tools
array yes I think this should work so we
go back in here of course this is
something that's in your blueprint if it
does work I'll show you guys um why it
works in a bit so yeah let's make
another
call grabbing my
phone hello this arm is Mary from Mary's
Dental how can I assist you today all
right perfect so um it picked up the
call so that means that I correctly
formatted the Json so if we go back in
here and then go to the Json editor I'll
show you guys what I did so you can
actually understand how that works oh uh
it seems I edit might have edited the
wrong one or the upper one
so we're going to have to redo that for
this version going to go here it's
saying false all right perfect let's go
in here
model
perfect go in here let's go again and
see if it actually does
work go back
here and that's make another
call couldn't get assistance okay
couldn't get assistance oh so that means
something went wrong in adding those
tools to our agents so let's see what
happened
here
body assistant
tools we're going to quickly check if
this is uh even correct
Json okay show me tools
oh that's a funny mistake okay so this
symbol right here is not supposed to be
inside of the bracket should be outside
of it so if we click this and then this
this is what it's going to look like I
can I think that this should already
work so the model is the llm model
that's um actually thinking about how am
I supposed to respond so this is how
vapy Works unless you're using something
like the realtime API which is speaks to
speech um it has a TTS model so text to
speech model which is in this case deep
gram which turns the words that the user
or the calling is saying uh caller is
saying into words then you have the llm
like open AI CAD GPT of 40 which we're
using right now which interprets that
text and then formulates a reply and
that for that reply is then turned into
a voice which the we use the 11 Labs um
API 4 now the model is the llm so the
model is jet GPT or GPT
4 and this one handles all of the
function so what we did is as a part of
that model we added the tool right here
so and basically what that means is all
of these objects so the email the full
name the phone number and appointment
date are going to be added to our um
going to be sent to our agent so if we
go in here and this is just Json
something you have to get familiar with
but this should
work and then if we go back in here
change this into this let's see if it
works
[Music]
now couldn't get assistant okay so this
is still not something that um V is
expecting so let's actually see what
we're currently responding with to see
if our Json is still incorrect or we
just not doing what VAP is expecting
thing so if we go back in
here this is still incorrect oh I didn't
update it of course so you do have to
click save if you're trying to update
your uh agent let's see let's go in
here then tools and this one has to be
outside of the quotes of course click
save click save let's see is this one
still correct yes this one's still
correct all right let's try that again
hello this arm is Mary from Mary's
Dental how can I assist you today all
right perfect so that means I was
actually able to make the call now the
next thing we're going to do is actually
build that tool so I'll uh be back with
you guys in a bit all right so here we
are again we got that information from
uh um from vapi so the next part or the
next thing we're going to do is actually
build that tool um so we're going to go
here and this is of course another
branch in that router and what we're
building the appointment setter so what
we're going to use for um today's video
is actually cal.com this is something
many people actually want to get
familiar with so I thought hey let's um
actually use cal.com in this case um
because it gives you it probably gives
you the best appointment Setters and
most flexible appointment Setters that
you can use um and sell to agents so
what you're going to do is go to cal.com
or app.com you're going to click new
right here can make a free accounts is
completely free you can make an event
right here that people can book meetings
in so virtual meetings for example um so
quick
chat URL we're going to call this um
Mary's
Dental right here quick chat um marry
appointment well this of course doesn't
make sense why would you make a digital
meeting appointment for Mar's Dental is
just an example in this video because
we're actually um the most interesting
use case for people who are actually
watching this is booking digital
meetings so that's what we're going to
do right now um in this case duration is
going to be 15 minutes you can add all
sorts of things of course descriptions
for example and then this is what you
get so you've made an account with
gal.com you went to event types you
create a new event and then this is what
it's going to look like now for the
purpose of this video I'm not going to
change anything in here I'm going to
just book it as is use it as is
but what we are going to copy is this
right here all right and we're going to
go to the um gal Doom aal.com
API
reference we're going to go in here
actually show you how to read this
reference in order to actually be able
to build and um um call.
a call /ai yeah we're not building with
that right now just scale.com all right
resources and then go to
API and then we have the API reference
right
here and then we're going to go here all
right so we're going to build an um uh
an automation we're going to
automatically allow the agents to set
appointments through cal.com and it's
going to send a confirmation email and
it's also going to actually book that
meeting and allow us to jump into a
video call so what we're going to do
right here is get the colom
API um so we add an HTTP modules so you
click here and then click HTTP and of
all of the modules you can choose you're
going to click make a request so make
request module you're going to see this
right here and then the first thing
we're going to have to add is a URL of
course so if we go here we're going to
have to find the right URL in order to
make a call so these this is the API
reference cal.com dos API reference V to
introduction if we go here we're going
to have to look at book meetings so
create a
booking and then copy this right here so
you have
this add it right there so this is going
to be the same for everyone this exact
thing and then we're going to click post
so choose post method and then the
headers are going to be Cal API
version so copy this
add an header call Cal API version so
this is just the version that you're
using for the API um cal.com wants you
to know if you're sending a request to
book a meeting to their server which
version are you actually using so that
we know what you're talking about in
your in your request so that they know
how to interpret that request so that's
the reason why they're asking for it and
of course we're going to have to add our
authentication so let's see
create a
booking headers must be this body vent
type ID
start so this looks like we don't even
actually need to add an authentication
token which is
strange data start length
guests time
zone all right option two option three
let's see let's just copy all this for
now all of this in here so in the what's
in between the small quotes copy all of
that and then put it inside of the B
body right here so body type is going to
be raw content type is going to be Json
application request content is going to
be this right here um
start
is let's see
actually um we're going to have to see
what is actually necessary in order to
to book that meeting so attendee is
required and name time zone is also
required the rest is not so let's remove
everything that's not required time zone
is required um email oh wow it's not
actually required we are going to add
that email and then
name so time zone email and name and
then phone number and language are not
required so why even add those or let's
just remove the language because of
course we do have the phone number so we
can leave that for now um and then
guests optional list of guests attending
the event so apparently that's optional
so that means we can remove all of this
we don't need to add that meeting URL um
if no meeting URL is
said
then if not provided then Cal video link
will be generated and that's exactly
what we want we want to use cal.com
video links so we're going to remove
this one location can also be removed
let's
see not sure if this is correct
formatting body
metadata I think this is supposed to be
in Brackets like that open
open oh no never mind I misread that
okay perfect um start is that one
required
okay s it's
601 U metadata we don't need any
metadata for this call so we can remove
that one metadata is not
required if I remember correctly
metadata is required but you don't have
to add anything here so we can just turn
it into this right
here make this
empty um booking field responses custom
field custom value don't need that as
well uh either all right all right so
this should probably work let's see is
there anything we haven't added that is
necessary status required but that's in
the response right yes that's a response
meeting URL guest event type ID phone
number language time zone all right
perfect right and the length is going to
be let's see 30
minutes no we don't have to specify
length because
our um event type already has a length
Okay so if we go back to c.com right
here we're going to go to event types um
you can find the event type ID in your
url right here so this is just these
seven digits that you see right here and
you can already put them here right
there click save all right so the next
thing we're going to do is actually make
that call to get that information from
our agents so that we can actually book
that meeting so um yeah let's do that
right now let's make another call try to
see if we can book a meeting and then uh
have that set up back with you guys in a
bit all right so we're calling our agent
one more time and we're trying to see if
we can get that information now just to
make it a little bit easier for ourself
we're already going to give this agent
our
um data so transcript for
call
um AI can assist you what is it okay
user um my email is j. Bergen at
f.com my phone number is
plus1 all
right my name is just for R
Bergen my email that you can use
for booking appointment
okay perfect this is just to make it a
little bit easier and quicker for
ourselves and then we're going to call
our agents and uh see if it books the
meeting for
us hello this is Mary from Mary's Dental
how can I assist you today hi could you
book a meeting or an appointment for
me sure thing yeser what's the purpose
of your
appointment um I just want to
to go by you guys and have a talk all
right all right when would you like to
schedule this chat what date and time
works best for you anytime is okay
actually all right cool gper I'll
tentatively set it for tomorrow at 10:
a.m. that work yes that will work thank
you this will just um take a second all
right perfect so we got the uh tool call
so all of the information is here but of
course course we haven't set up our
automation yet so what we're going to do
is go to this HTTP module that you see
right here and add all of those datas
that we just got from our agent so we're
going to go here the start is going to
so first we're going to look at these
the type has to be tool calls and then
if we go here and then function and then
arguments the appointment date of course
is going to be this vent type ID we
don't have to edit that the name is
Jasper the email is j. ryberg of this uh
time zone is going to be let's see UTC
let see if that works and then phone
number of course is going to be plus
31
Etc and we can make the oh and of course
we have to filter type is tool
calls only
tools perfect
save right here we are we have two three
branches assistant request and of cor
report and only tools so that's how that
works and then if we go here and copy
all of this output again so output
bundles copy all of this then we can do
the exact same trick and just try and
troubleshoot it 100 times without
actually having to call that agent so if
we click run once and then send that
data we can check what does um what does
it do with our uh request so unexpected
string
in Json okay so our we can see that our
Json was not correct so if we go here
and then open up Json editor it's going
to say this is wrong and it's probably
because we missed a comma there and this
one has to have I
think okay yeah there we are let's make
it pretty make it look like this
perfect so I have to remove a comma
here um okay so if we remove or add a
comma here and then remove this one it
should work and then of course we want
to pass the response so at least the
Json is correct now but we don't know if
we're sending what cal.com is expecting
let's so let's actually run that again
if we go back
here send that data let's see ccom sends
us another error attempting to book a
meeting in the past all right so we made
one uh mistake with the agent we have to
give it the current time so here's their
phone
number here is the current date and time
in
UTC so this is something you actually
have to give your agent or else it's not
going to know when to book a meeting
it's going to think that it's like 2023
or something because that's how the GPT
40 model is set so format
date add the now variable click save
let's just copy it from here so all of
this
so this entire format date we're going
to copy that put it in
here
color and
then the current date and time is and
then that's the current date and time
and then copy that we can add that to
the second agent as well because if it's
going to send is if it's going to want
to book a meeting for tomorrow is going
to have to know what the day is today so
that I can calculate tomorrow so there
something we're going to have to fix so
let actually see if we can find that
here and already fixed
that all
right so let's
see
dates strange it should be in
there what's it called
email appointment dates strange thing
that I can't find
it let's see go in
here appointment date so let's see what
it actually sent us 2025
01110 Z okay yeah that's in the past
exactly has to know what the current
time is so let's turn this into let's
see tomorrow and at
29
perfect and then put that right there
just from just some testing
data save run once let's see what the
cal.com platform tells us now probably
going to get another error oh no it
actually booked the meeting data success
data meeting URL perfect so we're
actually going to be able to use that if
we go add an Outlook module for
example create and send a message create
a connection I'll conect it to our uh
Office 365 of course you can also
replace this with an uh Gmail module
Google module or any other email that
you use we're going to send a
confirmation email to our uh to our
user subject uh booked the
appointment body content I we
successfully booked your
appointments it is
scheduled
for let's
see tool calls just something very quick
just to make sure that it works
appointment
date good
luck oh and add uh here is
your meeting URL just something quick to
make sure that it's actually sends it so
if we go here to data meeting URL save
oh of course we have to add recipient
where we're going to send the email to
in this case it's going to be this
person and then full
name all right
save and then of course we're going to
have to add a web hook response so the
web hook response is used us to um the
agent is currently calling sending that
data to our server but it wants to know
or get a message that everything went
okay so once to get a response from the
server I tried to book a meeting um did
it actually go well so that's what we're
doing right now so if we go to Tool
calling right here if we go down here
click copy put that in there tool call
ID that's what's in here tool call ID so
that's the ID that that vapy server uses
to identify which tool is called so if
you like if you have a million calls a
minute just to give an exaggerated
example um many tool call webbook
responses are coming in all of the time
and by ID is going to recognize okay
which tool call was that and which uh
call was that all right so result is
going to be um
successfully booked uh meeting so this
is what we're going to tell our agents
save click save all right so let's uh
test that again and see if it works all
right so let's do another entire run of
our agent I'm going to delete all of the
history right here and we're going to
test the entire agent as we've built it
right now so we're going to look at the
interface we're going to look at the um
call history we're not going to remove
that because it going to look make it
look a bit more
fancy um all right and we're going to
look at all of the results that we get
in our uh make.com in our air table so
um yeah what is supposed to happen is
we're going to call the agent it's going
to create a new user I'm going to get
then call it back it's going to remember
our past conversation and then I'm going
to also book um a
meeting of course I always have to add
those um details in
here let's see so let's actually add
myself right here plus 31
I can do that later let's
see here we
go all right let's um try this
out so let's call the
agent hello this is Mary from Mary's

customer and then if we call it back
it's going to remember what we just
talked
about Hello this arm is Mary from Mary's

31637
37432 email jper home.nl sound good it
sounds perfect
yes give me a moment thank you for
contacting Mary's Dental have a great
day all right so something went uh went
wrong here let's actually dive into it
see what uh see what happened um booking
error bet exception message user either
already has a book looking at this time
or is not available ah of course and
that's what because we've already booked
a meeting with this uh email so let's
actually add that to the history what
we're going to do is make this an even
better um tool we're going to add a
router right
here all right copy all of these
modules put them
there um copy these
modules that's strange
should be able to copy them copy
modules okay for some reason that's not
working let's actually see if we can
refresh make.com to make that work so
what we're going to do is we're going to
save the ID that is generated or made
when
and upon
booking and then we're going to
reschedule a booking or delete a booking
so we're going to go in here that's
really strange
clone let's do it this way then go in
here clone and clone
perfect and then we can remove all of
these go
here and then we're going to add a
module which is going to be an air table
module search
records move
this remove this
L go in here go in here
here only tools only
tools what we're going to do is we're
going to build um we're going to track
the ID of every call and then we're
going to get that after every call and
then uh reschedule an existing meeting
or delete the existing meeting before we
U um make a new meeting or new booking
so go in
here what we're going to do we're going
to find that customer of course by his
phone number uh customers
formula uh let's see phone
number
equals um customer phone number right
here limit is going to be one of course
and then if we go in here there's
something we're going to have to add and
that is the um meeting
ID
perfect let's
see field date um single line of text
create field meeting ID perfect is that
what we're going to want and for now
we're going to do
this just populate with something
nonexistent like this plus 31 637 37432
hit okay and then it's going to find
this well it's not a real meeting ID of
course but it's something that we can uh
can
use all right so um yeah let's build
this out all right so we're back in the
uh in the scenario and what we're going
to do is build out this rescheduling uh
workflow so that I can also identify is
there already meeting and then
reschedule it if that's the case so what
we're going to do is go in here and then
click meeting ID and if it equals zero
or
empty it
starts a new meeting so the very first
meeting and then a reschedule
meeting reschedule meeting that's if
meeting
ID not equal to
empty all right and what we're going to
do is go in here and then delete meeting
so bookings cancel a booking go in
here http module clone this one we're
going to make another API request to
cal.com what we're going to do is delete
that booking so meeting
ID
delete and we don't need any payload
here we're just going to or do we
booking
uid okay this parameter headers is going
to be this one this is probably the one
that we already have yes all right and
then data has to be empty so that means
we can remove all of this for that
one perfect and then method is going to
be
post all right so this is what we're
going to do and then of course is there
something we need to add API data
response cancel a booking right we don't
even need to authenticate ourselves in
order to because this is more on the
user side of course only the user will
know what their appointment is and then
if we go in here data meeting URL oh
we're going to have to change that into
the new variable so this will all be in
your blueprint of course
23 meeting URL
23
perfect then this is still the same this
is also the same all
right and then we have we automatically
first delete the existing meeting and
then if we clone this one and then this
one and then this
one and then add an error Handler so
sometimes you the meeting you're trying
to book a meeting that has already
passed in that case you can just resume
it so you can just resume that
um so sometimes you're um trying to so
it doesn't identify whether that meeting
idea is something in the past so if it
is in the past of of course you can just
reschedule a meeting it's not in the
future so in that case in the past you
can um um you can just delete that that
this is going to give an error so we're
going to make it resume despite that
error and still book that meeting
because we already know what that error
is going to be and then this one of
course is going to be
the module
27 so if we go here module 27
let's
see add that here this should be the
same exact version but then for module
27 and the web hook ID and then of
course there's one thing that we have to
add we have to update the air table
record so update
record base real
test sub
table customers
record ID going to be this one and the
meeting ID of course is going to
be right so I quickly had to update the
time to tomorrow but if we try to book
it right
now and we go in
here it scheduled the meeting and also
we can make it update the meeting ID so
we now have that variable for the
meeting ID if we go in here and check it
right here okay it still has to load up
make com can be slow at times so if we
go in here go in data and we can find
the U ID and that is exactly what we
need and then of course with this one it
also has to populate the um the uid so
let's see update a record create a
record so if we go here the exact same
module
clone and then go in
here record
ID and then this one has to of course
b23 update the meeting ID now I'll be
able to keep track of whether it has or
doesn't have a meeting ID so as you can
see it gives an error because error 44
not found if it's not found doesn't
really matter that means that the
meeting ID in air table is outdated and
that we can just book the meeting
without uh um without rush or a care so
in that case let's uh actually try this
again and uh book another meeting all
right here we are it's the following day
I had a few meetings and uh yeah had to
sleep of course but the next day we're
uh going back into the build and
actually testing the entire system the
entire agent so what we're going to do
I've removed all of the history so as
you can see no logs no meeting ID and
we're going to check if the assistant
that we've built together uh works now
of course we haven't added a check
availability um system yet so it's just
going to guess if there's an
availability now in . I've turned it uh
turned looking for conflicts off so it
will just schedule that meeting if even
if there are conflicts what I would
advise is um adding um HTTP module here
to update those uh to check the
availability so that the agent will know
which time slots are or are not
available so what we're going to do is
call this agent we're going to call it
and then it's going to uh book a meeting
for us and then in the history so in
that logs conversation is going to be
able to remember what meeting we booked
the second time that we called and then
if we call back then it's going to be
able to book a new meeting for an hour
later for example and then delete the
existing one and then uh book a new one
so that's what we're going to do right
now hello this like is Mary from Mary's
Dental how can I assist like you today
hi um yeah could you book a
meeting of course let's get you set up
what's your full name um my full name is
Jasper Jasper is
fine got it jper what's the purpose of
your appointment cleaning filling or
just want to chat with anything is fine
basically I just want to uh have a quick
chat cool cool when do you want to swing
by got any date and time in mind uh any
date and time is okay really how about
next
week all righty let me pencil you in how
does um Monday February at 10 a.m. sound
got that fresh Monday energy uh yeah
sounds good you're all set appointment
confirmed for Monday February 5th at 10
a.m. anything else you need yeser if not
I can wrap this up um no that's all
right thank you thank you for contacting
Mar's Dental have a great day all right
perfect we do really have to change that
voice there's like 3,000 voices that you
can choose from I think this is a
terrible voice but uh Hey it sounds uh
sounds good enough so at the end of the
call we get the call summary so the logs
and as you can see all of the details
that we want are inside of here so let's
call that agent back again and see if it
can reschedule that meeting now if we
look at the transcript it should say
when it booked the meeting so February
5th at 10: a.m. let's call the agent
back and see if it can schedule that
meeting for an hour
later hello this like is Mary from
Mary's Dental how can I assist like you
today um could you remind me when for
which time slot did we book our
meeting sure you're booked for Monday
February 5th at 10 a.m. ready to kick
off the week um with some awesome yeah
could you uh reschedule that to an hour
later give me a
moment you're all set esper your
appointment is now rescheduled like to
Monday February 5th at 11:00 a.m.
anything else you need if not I can wrap
this up no that's it thank
you thank you for contacting Mary's
Dental have a great day all right so
that's great but the voice is terrible
but it does uh actually work so what
it's able to do is Friday the server URL
is going to um uh reply to that uh
assistant request and pick up with an
agent and then it can book a meeting and
if there's an existing meeting delete
the existing one and then book a new one
and then at the end of call end of the
call it gives an end of call report of
course it's going to update this
information with all the history from
that call and then we get the entire
transcript which is then given to the
agent so in the next call it can
remember what it talked about and if we
refresh this we see all of the data that
we want to see so the total cost of all
of the calls is
$765 now of course that's something that
we edited ourselves
um and the total cost uh total average
cost is uh about 30 cents per call 25
calls have been made during this testing
and um these are the different reasons
that the call ended assistant ended call
pipeline error customer busy customer
ended call silence timed out so this is
how you can make this entire flow work
you can grab your own uh server here in
make.com you can use air table tables as
a database and then you can use the
interface function has a visual um login
page for either you or your clients that
they can keep track of their uh of their
systems and their agents now just to
confirm this is what we got in our um uh
in our email so these are the
confirmations that we
got from our uh from our agent now of
course this is double because we did
some uh did some testing but as you can
see it's first let's see what's the
first one first book the meeting so
that's the meeting and then it's um
let's see that's the confirmation of the
meeting and then that's a second meeting
so a rebooking of that meeting and if we
go here of
course oh in our.com if you visit
our.com you will be able to see that
that list of booking meetings has been
populated and can be added to your uh to
your calendar so that's how to build an
uh transient agent with tools and an
appointment setter using the text tag of
make.com air table both e table
uh data and the interface and also um
g.com and Outlook or office of course
and of course you can also replace this
with a Gmail um module right so thank
you for watching this video on how to
build your own appointment set I hope
you've really learned something about
how does this text stack work and as
I've said at the beginning of this video
the purpose of this video is to make you
familiar with every part of that text
stack and every element in the thing
that you're going to be building so that
you can actually tweak it edit it make
it into your own and also replace um
platforms like cal.com into canly for
example or Google caner if you get
familiar with those modules at make.com
you can replace them and really turn it
into your own as I've said at the
beginning of the video If you go to
members. f.com uh where you also
download the resources be sure to join
that Community if you have any questions
reach out to those people in the
community and they'll be likely to
actually answer those questions for you
um be sure to visit the partner port
portal make your sa self available reach
out to people on that partner portal to
work with if you have a project and
you're going to need any of their
assistance these people will be um uh
will be people that you can reach out to
now of course if you have if you're run
into any issues during this call I have
my Consulting sessions that you can find
right here book a 101 with Jasper I've
got amazing reviews from my Consulting
sessions you can also find it at
f.com and um yeah I'll help you figure
it out and make the most out of your
automations now if you want to really
upgrade yourself with 2025 we have our
2025 AI Advantage agent if you look at
flo.com you can actually see that this
is the exact agent that we're selling to
our own clients
for around
$5,000 per client per project so how
this works is if you uh go to this page
the AI Advantage agent you get a quick
preview of once you've built out the
agent what is it able to do it can reply
through text it can reply through email
it can reply through voice complete
Advanced memory across all of those
channels it will be able to book
meetings across all channels and
reschedule meetings leave notes make
call backs um it has a complete cold
calling scheduler which means that if
you upload a complete lead list it will
call around 200 leads a day five days a
week for8 hours and well there's lots of
stuff in this AI Advantage agent that
you can look into now there's two ways
that we um uh you can invest in this um
the first one is save yourself countless
hours I'm constantly updating this AI
Advantage kit with our newest models
features tweaks and uh improvements so
you will get instant access to the AI
Advantage agent if you buy this package
right here keep in mind somewhere in the
future we're actually planning to make
this into a subscription model instead
of a onetime fee so if you're seeing
this way into the future it might have
turned into an subscription model
already but if you're early of course
this is just a onetime fee and you will
get permanent access to the entire
Advantage agent and the first idea was
to just give a bunch of blueprints and a
bunch of tools that you can use and
figure out for yourself I've been
planning to actually make videos
exclusive videos for this AI Advantage
kit environment where other people of
course these are not going to be put on
YouTube these are very specific to the
blueprints in the AI Advantage kit so
they can actually know how do these work
how can I get started with it now as you
see right here the advantage kit is $450
and then the Tex stack is monthly cost
you're going to build this into your own
environment so that's not something you
pay us this is your own cost but once
you've build out the agent um the entire
tax stack so all of the platforms that
you'll be using and the average cost per
minute are going to be $35 and 14 cents
per minutes on average so that's a great
um advantage that you have compared to
white labeling platforms or kits like
this now do keep in mind you get all of
the tools all of the blueprints but you
will still have to figure it out for
yourself so if you're running into any
issues while building out your advantage
agent or you want to tweak things make
things into your own have specific use
cases of course there's going to be
content on how to do that but if you
want some support you can go back to
membersof flo.com book a oneon-one
session with me and I will help you go
through that Advantage agent and really
make it into your own in the future I'm
also going to add coaching sessions to
this packages of sessions with me or
someone from the flo team in order to
figure out how to really use and get
everything you want and need out of this
agent so in any case uh thank you very
much for watching looking forward to
seeing you in future videos and in the
community of course and be sure to
subscribe to this Channel and also leave
a comment uh saying what you thought of
this video really like the comments
beting on my uh videos and um yeah
looking forward to the next one bye-bye
