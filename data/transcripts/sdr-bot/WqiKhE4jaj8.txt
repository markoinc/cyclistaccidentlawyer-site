I will break down how you can create an
AI Instagram chatbot in
2024 and we are going to create a
chatbot that automatically answers
questions about an e-commerce business
by using Ai and I will guide you step by
step so I will show you how you can
create your first Instagram automations
how you can train your chatbot using
custom Ai and train it on your own
websites or internal documents about
your business and the four best
practices on when you're going to create
your first Instagram chatbot or when
you're going to create this for one of
your clients and at the end I will even
give you the template for free so you
don't have to build it yourself and you
can just copy and paste it and if you're
new to the channel my name is Jordan and
I'm the founder of chamise and at
chamise we are inspiring over 50,000
people every month to create chat
automations that generate leads boost
revenue and reduce cost and we are
working with business businesses from
small to large and in any industry so if
you just follow the steps in this
tutorial it will work for your business
as well so here's what we're going to
build we are going to build an Instagram
chatbot that automatically answers
questions about an e-commerce business
and in this video I will use the example
of an e-commerce business but this will
actually work for any kind of business
because we're going to train the chatbot
on a custom knowledge based document so
if you just change the content of that
custom knowledge based document to your
own business and train the chatbot on
that document it can automatically
answer questions about your business and
you will get full access to this
knowledge based document because I will
also give it to you with the free
template that you can get at the end of
this video Let's dive in the first step
that you need to take is create a free
manat account and man chat is the chat
automation platform that I've been using
for the last four years for all almost
all of my clients and I use manhat
because they're very easy to use if you
don't have any experience with chat
automation you can get started
immediately they're 100% meta approved
so you can just use them without the
risk of getting banned and they're very
cheap they offer a free plan but the pay
plan already starts at $15 a month so
what you need to do is you need to go to
jiz.com
/mc and this will bring you directly to
the man website and then here you can
click on get started and then select
Instagram and then continue with your
Facebook account and then now you can
log in with your Facebook account once
you have done that your manhat account
gets automatically created and I
actually have a separate video that
explains all the steps for connecting
your Instagram account to manat so after
watching this video I highly recommend
going to that video as well because
there are some steps that you need to
follow and if you miss one of the steps
it might be the that you cannot use all
the features of manat but once you have
connected your manat account to
Instagram you can get started with
creating your first Instagram automation
so let's say someone has a question
about your return policy this is a
question that is asked a lot to
e-commerce businesses then you want to
automatically answer that question and
we can do that by using manat so in many
chat we can go to Automation and then
click on new automation and then click
on start from scratch so this is an
Automation and each Automation in man
chat starts with a trigger and a trigger
is an event that starts the automation
so in this case it will be when someone
asks a question about the return policy
then we want to automatically answer
that question so in order to do that we
can just click on new trigger click on
Instagram and then select the Instagram
DM keyword the user sends a direct
message with a keyword and then here we
can determine to what message we want to
reply so we want to reply if the message
contains return and we want to reply if
the message also contains policy and we
can do that by using a message condition
so if you click on message condition
then we can say if the message contains
return and the message contains
policy then we are going to reply with
an automatic message so if you just
click on create here then we can
determine the first message in our
Instagram automation so here we can
select Instagram and then we can give an
answer to their question so I just copy
this from my second screen but we can
say at e-commerce Bas you always have
the option of returning your order
within 14 days after the delivery make
sure that the products have not been
worn and have all text attached when
they are returned so now if someone asks
a question about return policy then we
automatically answer that question with
this answer and after you gave an answer
to that question you actually need to
ensure a good customer experience and
you can do that by just asking Does this
answer your question and if they say yes
it did answer my question then it's all
fine if they say no it didn't answer my
question then you can connect them with
one of your live chat agents so what we
can do here is we can add a Next Step
which will be another Instagram message
and we can say does that answer your
question
and then we can add two quick replies so
one quick replies is will be yes it does
and the other quick reply is no it
doesn't oh no it
doesn't and then we can connect these
quick replies to two other messages and
to be clear quick replies in Instagram
are buttons where users can click on so
if they click on a quick reply we can
trigger another message so in order to
do that we can just grab this this
direct that over here and this is the
option when somebody clicks on yes it
does yes it does answer my question then
we can just say great if you have any
more questions feel free to ask them
here if they say no it doesn't we
actually want to forward them to one of
your live chat agents and this is great
about using man chat because man chat
has a build-in live chat so when your
chatbot doesn't know the answer to a
question we can actually forward them to
a live chat agent that can solve the
problem of the customer so here we can
just say no problem we will now connect
you with one of our support agents and
in order to connect them with one of
these support agents we actually need to
add an action to our flow so what we can
do here is we can add a Next Step which
will be an action and then here we need
to add three actions so if you can just
click on this then you can click on live
chat and then first we need to Mark the
conversation as open so in many chat you
have two types of conversations we have
closed conversations and open
conversations closed conversations are
conversations that are handled by your
chatbot and your chat automations open
conversations are conversations that are
handled by your support agents so what
you need to do in this case is Mark the
conversation as open then as a next
action we can click on this again click
on live chat and then assign the
conversation so here we can assign the
conversation to a specific team member
or to a specific group of team members
so in this case I would just assign it
to myself and then lastly we want to
notify the person or persons that are
assigned to this conversation so as a
last thing we can notify the
SNES and then we can say full name just
did something you wanted to know about
and you can actually change this
notification text so here you can for
example say okay someone has a question
about return policy and then you can
also determine how you want to notify
them so you can notify the whole team or
you can just notify them one person so I
will just select myself again and that's
basically it so now we can just click on
set live and that should be working so
every time someone asks a question about
return policy we give an answer to that
question and then we ask does it answer
the question if they say yes it does
then say great if they say no it doesn't
then we say no problem we will now
connect you with one of our support
agents so up until now it has been
pretty simple someone sends a question
to our Instagram account and we can
automatically reply to that question if
there is a certain keyword in it but we
can actually take it one step further we
can add custom AI that is strained on
our own data such as our website or
internal documents about our business
and many chat doesn't have build-in ai
so that's why we're going to use
chatbase chatbase is an AI tool that you
can use to train a chatbot on your own
data such as your websites or internal
documents and if you haven't used
chatbase before what you can just do is
you can go to chadis.com
[Music]
slcb and this will bring you directly to
the chatbase website and then here you
can just click on build your chatbot and
then you can log in with a free account
I already have an account so I'll just
go here to chatbots and then click on
this chatbot so what I have done is I've
trained this chatbot on a custom
knowledge based document and this custom
knowledge based document looks like like
this so it has information about returns
about delivery so the delivery times and
how people can trct their order the
shipping cost and about the warranty so
what are the warranty conditions if a
product is broken how they can get the
warranty all that information so what I
did in chatbase is I trained the chatbot
on this document so if you go to sources
and then go to files then here we have
the file that it has been trade on which
is this file and then here we can ask
questions to this chap out so here I can
say okay what are the shipment
costs then says if you order more than
50 the shipping costs are free otherwise
it's 5 then we say okay what are your
warranty
conditions then say if your product is
broken within 8 weeks of ordering it you
will be eligible for a full refund so
you can basically train chat base on
your own custom data which is in thise a
file but you can also train it on text
on your website on q&as on notion
basically on literally anything so this
is great so what we actually need to do
now is every time someone asks a
question in man chat we need to send
that question over to chat base chat
base will answer the question for us and
we can give the answer back to manat and
in order to create this integration we
are going to use make so make is an
integration platform that you can use to
connect applications to each other
without using any code and in this video
I'm going to use make to connect many
chat to chatbase and if this sounds like
a lot I actually have a step-by-step
video on how you can create this
integration between many chat and chat
base that appears over here probably so
if you're interested in that I highly
recommend checking out that video in
this video I will just use that
integration and we'll explain it like in
general terms but if you want to Deep
dive in all the things that need to do
please go to that video as well so what
we can do here is in many chat we need
to set our default reply so if we go to
settings and then go to Instagram then
here we have the default reply and the
default reply is the Automation in man
chat that triggers if no other
automation is triggered so if someone
sends a message and that message is not
triggered by any keyword or any other
manat automation then it will trigger
the default reply so what we need to do
here is in the default reply we need to
grab that question that they are asking
us and then we need to send that over to
Jet base and I actually created already
a flow for this that is also part of my
template that you can just download for
free so I highly recommend just checking
out my template and then using that in
your man account so here you can just
click on select existing and then you
need to select the Instagram default
reply
which is the flow that is part of my
template so we can pick this Automation
and then click on it and with this flow
there are a few important things so the
first important thing is the trigger so
the trigger is the default reply but it
needs to be set to every time so every
time someone asks a question we're going
to send it to chatbase and we want to
skip the story replies so if someone
replies to a story then we don't want to
send this to chat base basically because
story replies don't have have anything
to do often with customer support so
then what we're going to do in this step
is we're going to save the last text
input which is the question of someone
we're going to save that to a field in
many chat so I created a field which is
called chat based question and that
contains the last text input and then
we're going to send that question to
make so this is the trigger to make and
what then happens in make and this is
the scenario that we' been using again
this is part of my free template but
what we do here is we watch the data
from manat so every time this action is
triggered then this will start then
we're going to send the question to
chatbase chatbase gives an answer we're
are going to store that answer in a
manhat field and then we're going to
send a flow in man chat and the flow
that we will be sending is the chatbase
answer Instagram again this is part of
my free template but what we do here is
we're going to give the answer from chat
base and then we say Does this answer
your question if they say yes then it's
great if they say no then it says no
problem one of our agents will contact
you as soon as possible and help you
this is basically the same flow that we
did before with the return policy but
now we're using the chatbase answer
instead of a predefined answer that we
did ourselves but that's it that's how
we can add custom AI to our Instagram
chatbot so what you need to do now is
you need to make sure that this is set
to life and also you need to make sure
that the instag default reply is also
live when those are both live we are
using custom AI in our Instagram chat
bot and now we can take a look at
Instagram how this looks on Instagram
okay so now I'm on Instagram and then if
I ask a question about the return policy
so I can say what is your return policy
then our Instagram keyword will trigger
and it will automatically answer the
question for us so it will say at
eCommerce B you always have the option
of returning your order within 14 days
after delivery and then if we say yes it
does then that's working and now we can
also trigger chat Bas so if we just ask
another question for example what are
your warranty
conditions then it says if your product
is broken within 8 weeks of ordering it
you will get a full refund and I can say
okay what are your delivery
times and then it says if you create an
order before three it will be shipped
from our warehouse within two business
days and then if we say no it doesn't
answer my question and I need
help then it will say no problem one of
our agents will contact you as soon as
possible and then if you go to many chat
and then go to live chat over here you
will see that the message comes up and
then what you can do as a live chat
agent and this is the great part about
many chat because they have a built-in
live chat what you can do is you can
just pass the Automation and then you
can say hey Jordan here from e-commerce
Bas how can I help you and then a
customer support agent can actually
solve the problem for them and you can
see that it will look the same on your
uh Instagram account so we'll say hey
Jordan here from e-commerce B you can
have a back and forward conversation and
once you have solved the problem for the
customer what you actually can do you
can just pause the Automation and then
you can mark the conversation is closed
and then the chatbot will take over
again so now if I type in another
question for example how can I track my
order then the chatbot takes over again
will send the question to chatbase and
chatbase will send the answer back to
man chat so here will say yes you can
track your order when your order is
shipped you will get a track and Trace
link so that's it that's how you can
create an AI chatbot for an e-commerce
business on Instagram and before I'm
going to end this video I first want to
give you the four best practices on
creating your first Instagram chatbot or
when you're going to create this for one
of your clients so my first best
practice is to go live as soon as
possible and you want to do this because
when you go live you can get real
customer data and you can see where your
chatbot is already pretty good and where
your chatbot can be improved and this
will give you steps on how you can
improve your chatbot even faster so
that's my first best practice so my
second best practice is to go live with
just using Instagram keywords and not
going live with AI and if you get more
experience with ai ai is sometimes
really bad at giving good answers and
because of this what you actually need
to do is you need to train your AI
chatbot on your own custom data and then
you need to to have a lot of
conversations with your AI chapot to
fine-tune the answers and once you have
fine-tuned the answers then you can go
live with AI but especially at the
beginning I would just go live with
Instagram keywords because then you can
control how your chatbot responds to
certain questions and once you find
youed the AI part then I would go live
with AI and especially if you're doing
this with clients I don't recommend
going live with AI because if the AI
tool is giving bad respons to clients it
actually hurts their business and they
can probably back out from the project
all along so what you need to do is just
go live with keywords first and then add
AI in a later version so my third
recommendation is to create an
integration between the chatbot and an
e-commerce system so whether they're
using wo Commerce or Shopify or
Bigcommerce or Magento it doesn't really
matter you need to integrate your
chatbot with that e-commerce system
because that's where you can add the the
most value because a lot of people will
have questions about the status of their
order about the status of their return
and if you can get that information
automatically that will actually save a
lot of time and money for the business
so that's actually the third
recommendation what you need to do is
you need to create Integrations with the
e-commerce shop and my last
recommendation is to actually improve
over time and you can do this in
multiple ways you you can add more flows
you can add more knowledge to the AI
tool you can add more Integrations it
doesn't really matter but you need to
have a plan on how you are going to
improve the chatbot step by step but
that's it that's how you can create an
AI Instagram chatbot in 2024 without
using any code and there's actually much
more that you can do with Instagram
automation for example if someone
comments on one of your Instagram posts
you can automatically start a
conversation with them in the Instagram
DM and you can actually use this to
boost the engagement of your Instagram
account but also generate more leads
from Instagram so if you're interested
in that I highly recommend going to the
video that appears over here and if
you're interested in getting more
familiar with using many chat and
Instagram I actually have a manat
Instagram beginner course on my website
