once again the game has changed and
getting appointments for your business
has become so much easier with instantly
new feature the AI sequence generator
one of the most important aspects of
getting appointments for your business
or for your agency is to ensure that
your copy is set up for success and the
problem that I see a lot with business
owners and agencies they get roadblocked
on copy they have a brain dump they're
not copywriters by trade and it becomes
really challenging for them to figure
out what copy is actually going to
generate the appointments that they're
Desiring and this causes them to feel
frustrated and delay the ability for
them to actually get appointments or
they write copy that they think is good
that's not actually converting into
appointments and they just stop using
cold email in general with instantly new
AI sequence generator these problems are
now going to be solved let's check it
out all we need to do is log into our
instantly and when we go to our
campaigns all we need to do is add a new
campaign let's just call this test
campaign I'm going to click on continue
what we're going to do after we add
leads of course is we're just going to
pop over to sequences and then now what
you'll be able to see down below is what
we call the AI generator if I click on
AI generator it's going to ask me a few
questions first question what is the
name of your company so let's just call
Test Company cool continue what are the
details of your offer we help plumbers
generate five new sales appointments
every single week we do this by using
our lead pipe social system and continue
then let say our audience is plumbers
and HVAC companies and then it's going
to ask us what are some of the case
studies John's Plumbing added
$60,000 new Revenue SD plumbers got 20
appointments in 2 weeks JD plumbers had
to hire two new salese to keep up with
the volume continue and then ask how
many steps that basically means how many
emails do we want to send within the
sequence and then all I have to do is
click on generate what's going to happen
is it's going to automatically generate
a four step cold email sequence to
Plumbers with my offer using the answer
that I submitted and what it's
automatically doing it's automatically
adding spin tax it's automatically
adding in the company name it's
automatically adding in what's relevant
like our case studies and it's
automatically adding spin text to call
to actions adding spin text to the email
signature as well so let's just assume
that this is good to go I'm going to
click on use sequence it automatically
adds the subject line quick insight for
a company name what I can do is I can
click on preview now I can see the
preview of the actual sequence let's
just say first name is John company name
is John's Plumbing then sending account
first name would be whoever you're
sending it from which is based off of
your emails so now what we can see is we
added a four step sequence and the email
copy is pretty fire in my opinion so
let's go to step to open this up let's
just add in the first name of John
company name is SD Plumbing hey there
John just following up on my previous
email we've seen great success with our
lead pipe social ass in helping
companies like JD plumers hire two new
sales people to keep up with a volume
interested in learning more then the
sending account first name that will
come from the emails that you will add
in there and then the random variable
could be like hey hi whatever that's
coming from the spin tax once you add
the leads then it would add their name
the company name all we need to do is
save it and we can launch the campaign
after we add the leads to it how about
that guys for helping you get
appointments that much easier to get
started with this just go to instantly.
