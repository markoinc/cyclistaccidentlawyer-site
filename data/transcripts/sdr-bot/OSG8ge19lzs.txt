give you guys a walkthrough of an example 
conversation of how this would actually  
work um so one of the biggest ways that most 
people want to utilize conversational AI is  
as an appointment setter in their business 
um obviously because this Cuts labor costs  
a lot and if you can get if you can get a bot 
to act sophisticated enough to almost be seen  
as a human then it's very very efficient to use 
this in your business because they'll contact  
everybody that comes through into your system the 
speed to lead is under 5 Seconds the bot continue  
to follow up Etc so here's an example conversation 
of how this would work somebody would sign up and  
the example that we use here is for Fitness I 
just feel like it's one of the best examples uh  
because it's applicable to everybody so a lead 
will come into the pipeline let's just say they  
signed up through an ad and the bot would reach 
out with a trigger message say hey Woody thanks  
for signing up for a new fitness challenge 
what's your main Fitness goal right now just  
trying to lose a little weight the bot responds 
instantly uh that's a solid goal losing weight  
can feel like a journey but it's so rewarding 
what are you currently doing for exercise and  
then she says I can agree with that I Tred to 
do cardio on the weekends aha the struggle is  
real trying is the first step so you're on the 
right track and then the conversation goes back  
and forth until the bot sends an appointment 
link and that person has the ability to book  
their own appointment here now I'm going 
to break down two different ways of how  
you can actually go about this and set it up the 
first way is going to be a more simple version  
the second way is going to be slightly more 
complex if I have enough time I'll go through
both go ahead actually have a quick question here 
I'm sure on everyone mind how does the bot know  
when to send the appointment link now is it like 
based on duration of conversation or you how does  
the bot know when to send appointment link good 
good question so we basically we program it in  
a series of steps where it has to ask qualifying 
questions so our qualifying questions in this case  
were um let's see what are you currently doing for 
exercise and qualifying question number two was if  
they prefer group or personalized training and 
then after the qualifying questions are answered  
we move forward and book and we we tell the bot to 
send the appointment link and book the appointment  
wow that's amazing man is there is there a a place 
where disqualify that say you only do groups and  
if they answer like they want personal trainer 
would that disqualify them or is that more like  
the complex style thing uh not in this case 
but you could you could set it up to where it  
disqualifies People based on uh certain scenarios 
100% wow that's amazing this is something new uh  
all I can actually show you a yeah yeah I can 
actually show you a pretty cool example of that  
as well and how I buil it out so um I'm going to 
go ahead and run to the autom and show you exactly  
how this is set up well actually let's start in 
the settings so if you go to settings and you go  
to conversational AI you'll see back here you 
have the conversational AI now this suggestive  
conversational AI or the autopilot is not what you 
want to use it is something completely different  
to what we're using so you want to scroll down 
and you would just want to look at these settings  
down here the reply time and the maximum amount of 
messages that I can send to a contact so I reply  
time I usually utilize about 5 Seconds sometimes 
people um if it's a longer message the bot  
actually responds too quickly and people recognize 
that it's AI just because the the message is  
coming too fast so sometimes I'll I'll advise 
people to to make this 15 seconds now if we go to
automations the first one I'm going to go over is 
the simple automation all right so here's how this  
works let's say um you have your ad campaigns 
connected to this right so let's just say for  
example our trigger up here is like a Facebook 
lead form being submitted so now a Facebook  
someone is submitting a Facebook lead form and 
instantaneously that person is getting a trigger  
message so this is just a normal SMS action so 
uh Facebook lead form is being submitted this  
is just an example and then an SMS is being sent 
that is our trigger message so hey contact first  
name thanks for signing up for the fitness 
challenge what is your main goal right now so  
this is that initial message that we use now we 
add a weit period in here and we're waiting for  
contact reply we're waiting for a reply to that 
SMS specifically and typically I would time this  
out after about a day um but in this case I have 
a set up uh shorter just for this example okay  
now we have an if else condition so uh just to 
walk through this again leapor being submitted  
text messages being sent we're waiting for a 
response and based on when they respond or if  
they respond we have a condition contact replied 
true and then the other one is going to be false  
so nothing happened that means they didn't reply 
now if they reply we have our conversational AI  
tab here where we have our prompt our personality 
or instructions or questions um now something cool  
that we've done and actually um Vico this is one 
of the reasons why I didn't put together a Google  
doc is because we've actually pre programmed props 
into this so that you guys can edit them just by  
the click of a button so for example let's say 
you're clicking anywhere to add a conversational  
AI action that first it's going to pop up empty 
this Advanced bot configurations if you click  
the on button it pre-populates the prompts so 
we basically we know that not everybody's a  
prompt engineer so we push this button on and it 
automatically repopulates those prts and it will  
automatically um tell the bot that it's working 
for the company name uh that's on the sub account  
and it will pre-program those all you have to 
add is the qualifying questions that you want  
to include which is pretty cool um can I just 
quickly ask is that my in in a snapshot how can  
the prom be preloaded like that is that part 
of the snapshot or like so it's not actually  
part of the snapshot it's part of the actual 
conversational AI so anybody that goes High  
Lev snapshot or has go high level snapshot 
or not they can just click here type in the  
conversational AI action and it will pre-populate 
for anybody that pulls it up so all you have to  
do is turn this on and it loads by itself so 
voco for example if you were to pull up your  
own go high level and do this yourself it would 
pull up oh so like it's it's like a default prom  
that build in high level correct yes okay gotcha 
all right so we have um so lead form submitted  
text message we're waiting for the contact reply 
we have the if else condition whether or not the  
person replied and now we have our GPT action so 
what we're doing is we're telling the bot who it  
is so you are highly skilled Rockstar salesman 
for Total Fitness this is just a name I made up  
and your name is Alice and now uh this is just 
all of this is pre-loaded in this prompt and  
our first qualifying question is what are you 
currently doing for exercise and and then you  
have a a timeout option here which is basically 
if the person does not reply for uh in this case  
1 minute but again I would use one day and then 
we have our conditions now our conditions down  
here the way that it's set up is these are these 
are programmed by or they're determined by AI so  
they're not like your normal if else conditions 
in go high level where you have to manually like  
select reasons for why things have split decisions 
if so for example this decision down or this uh  
scenario down here says question is answered and 
I'm saying question must be answered to move to  
this step or to move to the next step so AI is 
able to register whether or not they answered the  
question and it will only move them to the next 
step if they answer the question if they answer  
any other question or they ask a question or the 
question just isn't answered at all it will not  
go into in this case right it won't not go to the 
next step um so we have our prompt in here AI is  
determining what our scenarios are and uh this 
is actually where you could put for example um  
disqualify right so let's say for example Vico we 
were to put um person does not exercise right and  
this is just an example we're not actually 
we would never disqualify someone if they  
don't exercise that that isn't a thing that 
any gym would do but um you would say if the
person says they do not
exercise they are dute so we would save this 
action and now it adds that action here person  
does not exercise so they would answer you know 
I'm not you know I don't currently do any exercise  
at all we can just add them to a workflow whatever 
disqualification workflow that you guys have so  
some people um yeah so you could just remove 
them from the workflow or whatever it might  
be mark them at a tag mark them as dqd whatever it 
might be um so you can just add on conditions that  
easily um just quick question here Ashton like 
from your experience how good is the actual bot  
um actually being able to like you know separate 
this person based on the condition that you have  
like for example you you write the one here uh 
they are theq does the Bob actually understand  
what DQ mean yes yes it does yeah all right 100% 
does a very good job yeah it's it's connected  
directly to Chad GPT so um yeah if if it will be 
able to recognize based on their response whether  
or not they you know the person does or does not 
exercise and it will know that it needs to move  
them in here to disqualify and and just a followup 
question on that um is that GPT 3.5 or four right  
now it's 3.5 all right cool but we're working on 
adding four uh so you can toggle between back and  
forth all right so I'll go ahead and delete this 
option for now and we'll keep this thing going  
so in this case if the go ahe oh sorry we have 
a question in one of the comment Melody R ask  
can we train the bot on nich specific terminology 
100% so in here if you're updating the like for  
example in the additional instructions you could 
add whatever you want so for example I have use  
your Woody side and say things like LOL and haha 
when necessary this makes it seem more personable  
to to use that type of terminology so any specific 
or nich specific terminology you would want it to  
use you can just add it to the instructions um 
so you could say you could even provide like a  
list of um you know phrases or terms that you 
would like the bot to frequently use and you  
could just paste them in there and say um try 
using these terms um frequently as it relates  
to my Niche for example you just want to tell 
the bot how to behave and prompt it accordingly  
I see well that's amazing Sebastian here ask 
uh are we able to use this B on WordPress via
plin great question not at the moment but 
we are currently working on adding it and  
I think it's we're about three weeks away 
so three to four weeks and we will actually  
um have an option to start using this so 
if you go if you look down here we have  
the option to select between the channels of 
where you would like to use the bot so right  
now we have SMS Facebook and Instagram we're 
going to be adding the chat widget very very  
soon so you're going to be able to embed this on 
websites oh I'm I I really want to see that on  
email man we got a lot of email replies really 
yeah this is uh that's another one we're going  
to be adding to um that one takes a little bit 
more work though because you have to structure  
emails in a certain way uh and they have like 
a specific type of format so it takes a little  
bit more work but we're we're trying to make 
it for as many channels as possible all right  
all right so in this scenario so we have um the 
bot here question is answered is our a scenario  
so if that is the case so here we give it a 
scenario if they answer the question it goes  
to qualifying question number two and I actually 
the the conversation that I showed you is using  
this workflow so the the conversation that 
I showed in the beginning is actually using  
this workflow so qualifying question number 
two at the bottom do you prefer group fitness  
classes or more personalized experience right 
so it's the exact same personality the exact  
same instructions on every single one that we use 
the only thing that we change is the qualifying
question and then we have the conditions 
breakdown again so now if they answer this  
so question must be answered to move to the 
next step if they answer qualifying question  
number two we move it down to booking bot 
and in the questions area we say send the  
booking link tell them to let you know when 
they have booked so that you can confirm it  
again the personality is the same additional 
instructions are the same in every single  
one and then just in case they ask another 
question instead of booking we create one more
step same personality additional 
instructions and then questions  
are just any general question questions that 
the bot feels necessary to ask based on that
response okay so now to do the let's do one 
more run through here on how this is working  
Facebook lead form is submitted we send that 
trigger message we wait for a response whether  
or not they respond determines where they go 
here if they reply we have our conversational  
AI widget with the prompting if they answer 
the question it goes to qualifying question  
number two if they answer that it goes 
to the booking bot just in case they  
ask another additional question it goes one 
more step and you can make as many steps as  
here as possible so if you feel like the person 
might continue to go back and forth and back and  
forth you could just keep duplicating the step 
and going down and down and down all right any
questions um I might miss this but uh is there 
is there any prevention let's say if someone  
stop replying because that happen all the time 
right when you text someone and then they just  
stop replying it would they go into a another 
follow-up sequence like that good question so so  
in the simple buildout so I have another one I'm 
going to go over as well in the simple buildout no  
this is just the person responds the bot responds 
if the bot if the person does not respond there  
is no follow-up sequence in place the second one 
that I go through includes a follow-up sequence  
in M multiple different scenarios it's a little 
bit more complex and it looks kind of scary so  
I wanted to go over this one uh first I see I see 
so I I think we go to let the audience aside guys  
we're going to give you two option here number 
one we're going to spend the remaining uh minutes  
or you know we're going to spend the remaining 
minute dive a little bit deeper to the simple  
workflow which is the one we looking at right now 
or option number two we're going to go into the  
complex workflow which involving the followup 
if the lead is not responding so I'm going to  
let majority vote here if you want option number 
one which is staying going into more detail about  
the simple workflow drop a one uh if you want to 
do two where we look into a complex workflow just  
drop a two and we'll we'll just let you got decide 
all right we'll go a lot two here Ashton all right  
perfect looks like we're going to the the complex 
workflow so this is going to initially it looks a  
little bit scary but it's not as scary as it looks 
okay slightly more complex here I know it's there  
like webs going all over the place but uh once I 
walk you through this I think it's going to make  
a lot of sense okay so similar trigger right uh 
at the top so let's say a Facebook lead form is
submitted we have that trigger message that goes 
out we're waiting for a response and now this is  
a little bit different so the condition we have 
here is if the person responds if the person does  
not respond if the person does not respond we 
have a another conversational AI action where  
we specifically make a follow-up bot so we still 
tell them who they are the only difference is that  
they objective is you have not received a response 
in your last message and your goal is to come up  
with a unique follow-up message person has not 
responded in one day never use the same response  
twice every response should be entirely unique 
and then the question is any relevant question  
that they haven't asked in the past so AI will 
just generate you know a new question to keep  
them engaged or try to re-engage them into the 
conversation so we create a section where if  
the person doesn't reply now if they do reply 
we still have our same uh basically the exact  
same setup as the previous one okay so we have 
the no condition met timeout which means they  
didn't respond and if the question is answered 
so what's happening here is for the timeout so  
timeout means the person did not respond in this 
scenario right so the one day goes by there's no  
response we have a go-to action that routes 
specifically to the follow-up AI now let's  
say the the bot will send a follow-up message and 
say hey I see that you uh weren't able to respond  
to my last message um and if a conversation was 
happening it will actually refer to something  
that it said in the last conversation like I 
see you're trying to lose weight just one to  
reach out and see when's a good time to set up 
an appointment something like that um it would  
come up with a unique response every time 
and then we have different conditions here  
on this one so we have person responds with no 
conversation history so if if it's their first  
response and then we have the person responds 
but they already have answered the qualified  
question number one and we have it go to so if 
the person with no conversation history answers  
we send it to ask the first qualifying question 
if the person person responds and they've already  
answered qualifying question number one 
we send them to qualifying question number
two does this make sense so far yeah yeah it 
it looks FX but I'm I'm staring to get it so  
hopefully okay hopefully you guys do the same 
oh we got the a little bit question here Goan  
here asking like canand these be trigger from a 
regular form like when a form is submitted I think  
100% yeah and uh Eric here asked will we get the 
world slow so we can modify that to our business  
I think he referring to a snapshot like will 
that will be will you be sharing the workflow I  
think that's what he meant we will potentially be 
giving away both snapshots so the snapshot the the  
complex snap snapshot and the simple snapshot but 
I've also I'll go over this a little bit after uh  
I actually complete this I I've uh I've created a 
way to make this very very very very simple um and  
I'll get into that after after the I I finished 
with this portion so now we have if it times  
out we're setting it to the followup now if they 
answer the question qualifying question then the  
same kind of thing it goes to the booking bot if 
they answer that question if it times out again we  
send it to the follow-up bot so it's actually now 
that I'm breaking it down it's probably seeming a  
lot simpler than it looked in the beginning no 
condition met I have a weight period here and I  
send it back here so for example we're sending 
it to the follow-up bot if it times out if the  
question is answered then we send them to the 
booking bot no condition met basically means  
maybe they responded and they didn't answer the 
qualifying question so qualifying question here  
is or the qualified question number two would be 
do you prefer group or personalized training maybe  
they say something like just tell me how much it 
costs for example right A lot of people like to  
say that instead um that would fall into into 
no condition met we have a weight period here  
where I usually just put like a a few seconds on 
the weight period and then I route this back to  
question number two and it will basically um 
address the question that they asked or what  
they said but it will continue to try to get the 
answer to that qualifying question now the reason  
why I have a weight step here is to avoid uh loop 
blcks are you familiar vco with Loop blcks have  
you ever had that happen in a workflow uh yeah 
so a a loop blocks meaning it's it's going to an  
infinite loops and the high level system just try 
to cut it out yeah on the right track yeah bingo  
bingo yeah so if you if you were to remove this 
weight period and it was just no condition met  
go to back to qualifying question here um adding 
a weight step actually gives you some leeway it  
gives you some room to kind of make that error 
or make that mistake without actually getting  
flagged so uh the more weight steps you you have 
before the go-to action the more you will actually  
be able to avoid getting Loop locked what is 
the interval like 30 minute like or like uh it  
doesn't matter I just use a few seconds here oh so 
0.1 minutes yeah the weight step in general just  
helps avoid that all right and then we have uh so 
qualified question number two so no condition met  
we're routing it back to the same questions if it 
time out or it times out we go to the follow-up AI  
if the question is answered we send it back here 
so this setup is basically the exact same as the  
last one the only difference is that number 
one we've created a follow-up bot right so we  
have this and two creating a go-to action to that 
follow-up bot every time the bot times out so if  
the person does not respond we are now following 
up with this person every single day until they  
respond which means if AI is creating follow-up 
messages you don't need your own nurture campaigns  
you have a never-ending follow-up sequence here 
so if someone enrolls himself or opts into your  
ad and they don't respond like a lot of people do 
um because leads aren't perfect you know a lot of  
people just opt in and they don't respond for 
whatever reason you have a follow-up system in  
place to continue reaching out to that person and 
AI will generate a new and unique message every  
single time it's trying to follow up with that 
person and re-engage them so it's it's pretty  
awesome actually and then we run this down to 
stage number two or well the booking bot and then  
if they ask a question we have another booking bot 
the only difference here is our conditions we have  
the same conditions but we're just creating weight 
periods and we're routing them back to the booking  
bot so that a people continue to ask questions or 
if they don't respond without booking whatever it  
might be then we're routing it back so that the 
bot continues to re-engage them continues to  
answer questions and basically just be a general 
support bot until that person finally books an
appointment questions do you think will work with 
e-commerce let's say um let's say someone have a  
low ticket where you know you try them back to 
buy a $70 uh ebook or something or or even an  
abandoned card will this work with e-commerce 
100% absolutely yes you could set this up uh so  
the initial triggers would be different right 
so um I'm not too familiar with the e-commerce  
triggers but let's just see if there's a yeah so 
abandoned checkout right duration 10 minutes so  
let's say um they abandoned their checkout for 
example you could create a specific workflow to  
reach out and follow up with that person in the 
exact same scenario the only difference would  
be the prompting you would want to specify the 
prompting for the scenario so you would let them  
know in the additional instructions that um you 
know the person visited the page added to their  
cart but they did not buy and your job is to 
follow up with the person ask them questions  
and re-engage their interest something like that 
wow yeah I I definitely use a coupon code yeah  
for e-commerce but yeah man like I I would bet 
all those e-commerce store would be willing to  
pay a lot of money for for an AI bot like this 
guys like if any one of you in the e-commerce  
space this is a huge opportunity right um so 
yeah I mean like is there is there more to it  
or is there like Q&A time Ash um so there's one 
last thing and then and then we'll go Q&A so save  
this so that basically breaks down the gist of 
How I build it um and exactly how we get it to  
respond and follow up now what I have done is I 
created a snapshot um and I if if you aren't go  
high L users I actually have uh the entire you 
know go high Lev sub account that we that we  
give to you but we set it up in a way like this 
you don't have to ever go into the workflows to  
actually program the bot I have the workflow set 
up and it's already deployed in the account all  
you have to do is go to the custom values I 
created a conversational AI folder and all  
of the custom values are editable directly from 
just from this folder so if you want to make any  
changes to the bot to the um based on its company 
information the company name the name of your AI  
assistant qualifying questions all you have to 
do is go back here edit the information and it  
will automatically update the workflow because 
we pasted these custom values in the prompt that  
we have so no steps no building 100% just you 
deploy this into your account and you can make  
the updates just from the custom value no way 
man that's crazy that would save me so much  
hour because my my intention was to come to this 
training learn it from you and spend the next two  
to three day build it myself so you you're telling 
me I don't have to build this on my own so is it  
like a snapshot or what is that is it gonna be a 
snapshot at the end of this right uh yeah so um  
I I put this snapshot together uh recently just to 
to make it more user friendly for everybody um and  
then Vico whether or not we're going to we can 
we can connect after this and kind of see what  
the best way to go about it is um but yeah I I 
would like to I would like people to have access  
to this they didn't have to go through actually 
setting everything up guys that that is like I  
said my intention was to come here and learn and 
spend the next three long days building it myself  
but it looked like we're just going to shorten 
that to three minute based on the custom value  
that he showed us so thank you so much ashon 
thank you so yeah no problem no problem you  
any time guys uh thean here asked uh do you think 
you can add WhatsApp as one of the medium in the
future yes so that's um chat widgets WhatsApp and 
email are three things that we're looking to add  
in the future yeah and when you said we you mean 
the high level team right not not not the uh your  
company yes yes correct yeah high level is um so 
one of the uh the director of automations who is  
like in control of the research and development 
um so we're working on implementing new channels  
and that is our that's our next step so I know 
um the chat wages we have coming in the next  
few weeks and we're continuously making those 
developments all right yeah let's go ahead and  
uh yeah come come to the stage bro what's up hey 
hey guys sorry um I didn't see how they're getting  
kicked out of the workflow is it when they book 
an appointment it automatically kicks them out of  
the workflow I have one similar to that is that 
how they get out of it great great question yeah  
100% so um depending on the use case you would 
want to we create like a stop bot campaign where  
we can just remove them completely from that 
workflow and um add a tag or something that  
just make sure they don't get re-enrolled to that 
workflow anytime an appointment is booked now this  
would be specifically for an appointment booking 
bot if you're using it for abandoned checkout or  
if you're using it for maybe maybe just like a 
general support bot uh you'd probably want to  
use a different trigger but you can you can 
cre workflows to make those to make the bot  
stop replying hey what's up Daniel hey how you 
doing bdy um yeah just curious I came kind of  
late so I know that like I was testing out the 
you know like the regular go high level bot or  
whatever uh like on an Instagram and stuff like 
that and it was just tripping up like crazy and  
sending information that just was not correct so 
is this bot like the regular go highight bot or is  
this like something different and I apologize for 
being late yeah yeah no problem so it's completely  
different the regular go highle bot uh it well 
if you want to call it that is the it's like  
this autopilot and suggest suggestive version 
so it's based off of FAQ and it's programmed  
by links that you give it um so it's not as 
sophisticated it's not very conversational  
and if it doesn't knows the answer to a question 
it will say things like sorry I don't have enough  
information to answer that question in this case 
we're prompting it which chat GPT and we're giving  
it a specific direction to follow down so that it 
can always it always has an answer to a question  
and it doesn't trip up like the one that you're 
talking about I know exactly what you uh what  
you're referring to those Bots um the very first 
bot that was programmed in the go high level was  
not the best it made a lot of mistakes this one 
is much more sophisticated okay cool yeah thanks  
um I got a question myself which uh thanks to uh 
Daniel for reminding uh remind me of this how is  
this different from Eliza cuz go have 500 bucks 
a month paid service for Eliza right even like HL  
Pro 2 have something like zap chat right and even 
uh extended themselves have something like extend  
starting to build their own AI bot so like how is 
conversation AI the one which just build different  
from those bot that which like cost F above the 
months right yeah so the plus side to Eliza is  
that it's programmed to work directly with the 
calendars of go high level right um the downside  
is that it's not actually AI it it's programmed 
by FAQs so when you're booking an appointment  
with Eliza it's able to actually say um toes 7 
o'clock work tomorrow someone says yes and it can  
actually book that appointment onto the calendar 
manually which is another thing that we're trying  
to program into the chat GPT bot that I just went 
over but the problem is that it's an FAQ bot so  
it it's not conversational um if it doesn't have 
the answer to a question or it's not in the FAQ  
list that you give it it's not able to respond 
and be conversational the plus side is that it  
can just book onto uh actual calendars and in this 
case it cannot book on accounts oh makes sense um  
yeah this is another real quick so I was just a 
little confused um by what Ashton said there so  
the bot that I was using on Instagram even though 
it was basically uh for lack of a better word junk  
it still was able to book an appointment directly 
on uh my calendar so it so is so is the bot that  
you're talking about here not able to book an 
appoint man or so here is uh an overview of how  
the bot works so it's programmed by a series of 
qualifying questions it's connected to chat GPT  
so that I can remain conversational um and 
we set it up in a way so that it has like a  
direction to go in its ultimate goal in our use 
case is to book an appointment but we do that by  
sending an appointment links uh an appointment 
link so it'll ask those qualifying questions  
it will send that link um after their qualifying 
questions are answered and the person can click on  
the link and go to book an appointment now with 
the Eliza booking bot it's not as sophisticated  
not as conversational so if you look at these 
conversations here uh even when it's referring  
back to what the person said or like haha the 
struggle is real trying this first step so you're  
on the right track very conversational almost 
comes off as a human there's no way you'd be able  
to tell this is AI unless it was just responding 
too quickly so that's the upside to this one the  
only downside is that you have to send a link to 
book an appointment but um you get better show up  
rates 90% of the time if you send it a link and 
you allow the person to book themselves so um  
show rates actually decrease whenever you have the 
Eliza booking bot book onto the calendar okay one  
last followup question to that yep uh the links 
that it's sending uh are we able to customize  
those ourselves or or are they just being pulled 
from the calendar 100% you can customize them  
however you'd like whatever link you want to 
use you can use a calendar link you could use  
a HubSpot link use a schedule once link use a go 
high level link any yeah just a quick note on that  
I would personally redirect uh I'm going to go to 
setting on high LEL and go to URL redirect and red  
like redirect it to my domain so it's like it's 
it's look more professional and then you get more  
flick through with that I personally would do that 
uh Daniel Harris have a question hey please go let  
them Speak oh yeah just um just one quick one I 
have a um a client who has an Aesthetics when so  
it's all Botox injections and all of that kind of 
stuff to do something like obviously they've got  
a range of services that a offer would I need to 
create a new flow um a new a flow for each service  
so it would know how to respond or is there a way 
of doing it for sort of Aesthetics generally great  
great question so um when you are and I'll go over 
this I'll share my screen to kind of give you a  
breakdown for that question so in these The Prompt 
is the same in each one right the only problem is  
that it caps you on how many characters you can 
enter so what I would do is create custom values  
for each service that you would like to to be 
familiar with um and I would paste the I would  
say something like these are the services that 
you offer or that um the company that you work  
for offers something like that and then I would 
paste the custom values below it and use it in  
each prompt like every single prompt that you 
see in here uh for just for the conversational  
AI actions and then the bot will be able to 
reference those Services any point that is  
necessary in conversation so you could have one 
bot understand all of the services okay yeah that  
Mak sense yeah so that yeah cuz otherwise it's can 
be for L work to do I I 100% agree with you yeah  
I would say in the additional instructions just 
let the bot know um these are the services that  
you offer and just make sure it knows that you'll 
be 100% fine perfect thank you yeah no problem  
uh um just quickly I I have my own personal 
question do you happen to have an example of  
um um a followup bot right so basically if like if 
you don't respond and you ignore them do you have  
like any example that I that we can see of them 
following up to you uh I could probably I I would  
love to that man so I just enrolled myself into 
the workflow see I received that trigger message  
perfect and now I'm in the weight period and I'm 
just going to push myself through to that next
stage if you're ever testing workflows by the way 
um as you're creating uh workflows or actions or  
triggers and you don't want to wait for the 
weight steps that you have in your workflows  
you can always just come to the enrollment history 
and just throw yourself into the next stage it's  
actually really helpful Tim Tim rise asking uh 
is this using uh using chat GPT API therefore  
needing a fun chat GPT account um no no this is 
actually yeah I'll yeah no I was goingon to say  
yeah this is uh directly made in high level um 
they charge you per action I think it's like one  
to two cents per go like chat gbt response um but 
it's included in high level and then here is an  
example of followup message it will basically just 
continue to follow up every single day depending  
on how long you set up the timeout period it will 
just follow up with that person every single day  
until they get a response and then it will be 
reenroll back into the conversation the bot will  
start responding again and and when you said every 
every single day like that's like infinite right  
so it's just going to go on forever 100% yeah oh 
wow um the cool thing about this is if you're if  
you're consistently generating leads once you 
set this up uh eventually you get to the point  
where let's say a month goes by and you have new 
leads coming in and you're continuously following  
up with people every single day it's almost like 
you're doing a reactivation campaign every day  
like for example for for my B well it it's worth 
it so with with follow-ups you start booking  
appointments just from follow-ups alone like we're 
we're sending probably like 20 thou, messages on a  
daily basis here's another one so um yeah here's 
a followup see if you had a chance to check out  
our latest fitness challenge how can I assist you 
further with your fitness goals um you'll start  
sending up bulks of messages because people keep 
following falling into that follow-up Pipeline and  
then you'll see just appointments getting booked 
just from follow-ups alone it's awesome this is  
life changing this um uh just just quick question 
here uh like so H have 97 297 and 497 plan this  
will work in all here or is it just for the SAS 
mode good question I believe I know it works for  
the 297 plan I think it works for the lowest tier 
as well but I'm not 100% positive all right yeah  
okay cool just just give give us an idea here um 
how many of you guys in the zoom chat is on the  
497 plan right now just just the type of one if 
you have 497 plan oh wow so we have a fair bit of  
people that's good yes oh uh we got Claudia here 
ask if the person doesn't want to receive a full  
followup uh message could ason show us the part 
of the workflow um if if the person doesn't want  
to receive that I would just assume like they just 
reply stop right it does so another another thing  
you could do as well and this is uh we haven't 
ran into many issues with this but sometimes when  
you're doing cold campaigns you will obviously not 
everybody wants to be contacted you'll get people  
who um cuss you out or just don't want to be 
contacted so what I would do in that that scenario  
is let's say let's use the simple one I would add 
a condition on here and you could just say person
is unhappy or
uninterested just copy that you would paste that 
in the condition so the condition is where you're  
naming it or the branch name you're just naming it 
something but the condition is your actual prompt  
to chat GPT so person is unhappy or uninterested 
you could say something like any signs
of
disinterest send them here and that will create 
another branch and then you could DND that contact
so you don't continue to reach out to that person 
so there's a solution to that problem okay there  
is no question this guy can't answer so um yeah 
uh man that's amazing um like just quick one  
here can we integrate picture or or GI right GI 
into this like let's say we want to lighten the  
M like we send a picture or give is that is that 
possible or not in this conversation not at not  
at the moment uh unfortunately so uh Nan here say 
that conversational AI work for all tier so that's  
mean 97 plans still work I guess this makes sense 
because that action out is a paid action guys so  
they actually make money every time you trigger 
it so I would assume they um have it for all plan  
even the small plan right so yeah yeah one of 
the um something that's actually really awesome  
especially if if you're if you're running a 
marketing agency but even if you're not they  
have an unlimited plan $49 a month you can use 
as many chat GPT actions as you want doesn't and  
it has like it it doesn't matter if you're you 
cold messaging 10,000 people a day whatever it  
might be $49 a month doesn't matter how high you 
go on that and and and and how can you buy that  
you go to uh marketplace right or you go setting 
and Marketplace and you buy the 49 how I I how  
do you actually subscribe to that if you it does 
make sense right once once you actually do it at  
MTH volume yeah 100% so if you go to settings 
you go to conversational AI you scroll down  
to the bottom current plan upgrade to unlimited 
boom boom there you go guys you're selling it to  
your client and like you can actually charge your 
client for this and then actually have yourself on  
the unlimited plan I think yeah maybe you can 
do that and then that would be really highly  
profitable yeah % um thank you so much guy for 
tuning in and I'll see you on the next one hey  
guy if you enjoy watching the video make sure that
