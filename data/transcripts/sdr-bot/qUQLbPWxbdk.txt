# Category: vapi-voice

hello and welcome in this video I'll
create an air voice agent sort of like a
virtual receptionist from scratch the
air agent will receive a call answer all
the users questions from the knowledge
base and then send them an email with
the cly link so that they can book a
meeting and finally after the call ends
the a will create an end of call Report
with the call summary and write it to
Google Sheets okay so I'll be creating
this AI receptionist for my AI agency
flip bites so that you can follow along
also in this video I will deep dive into
the W voice a platform and we'll go over
all the key settings you need to know to
build powerful voice AI agents okay
here's a quick demo of what we will be
building okay great so for the demo what
I'm going to do is I'm going to call
this number 646 762
5060 and uh then I'm going to talk to
the AI agent basically because this
number is connected to flip bites AI
agent right here okay so once I call
this number this should get activated
ated and once this activates I'm going
to ask the AI agent certain questions
and after that try to book a call if
possible so okay let's see how that goes
I'm going to call it right
now there thanks for calling flip bites
AI agency we specialize in AI automation
to boost your business how can I assist
you today hi I wanted to actually get a
wife's a solution for my business
awesome our AI voice agents are designed
to optimize customer engagement and a
automate business operations would you
like to set up a free consultation to
discuss this further yeah sure but
before that I wanted to know what
exactly voice AI is could you tell me a
little bit about that sure thing voice
AI uses Cutting Edge Technologies like
vapi and Hume AI to create intelligent
voice agents these agents can handle
customer inquiries provide seamless
interactions and automate business
operations they help enhance user
engagement and operational efficency
would you like to dive deeper into this
during a free
consultation yeah I want to know that as
well but uh before that again uh wanted
to know more about your services so what
all services do you guys
provide sure thing we offer a range of
AI driven services including one AI
voice agents these optimize customer
engagement and automate business
operations two AI chat Bots intelligent
chat Bots that provide instant responses
and automate routine interactions three
custom coded AI apps tailored AI
applications for your specific business
needs four AI okay marketing automation
that sounds good okay so yeah I can I'm
ready to book a call
now great let's get you set up can I
have your first name phone number
including country code an email address
I'll send you a calend link to book a
time that works for you yeah that sounds
great okay so my first name is Rob and
my phone number is + 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
and my email is hello flip b.co and that
is flip bites which is starting with an
F uh f l i p b YT s.co did he get all
that got it Rob so to confirm your phone
number is +12
345678 your email is hello at flip.
compan is that correct it's not compan
it Isco so it'll be f as in Frank
LBT s.co and it's hello flip bites. got
it so your email is hello flip bites.
that's f as in Frank L IB YT s.co
is that correct yeah that is correct
perfect I'll send you the cly link so
you can book a time that works for you
keep an eye on your inbox if you have
any more questions just let me
know sure that sounds great all right
awesome so I've received an email and uh
let me just open this right now and it's
right here uh for Rob with the canly
link so if you click on this link you
directly go on the meeting uh you know
you can easily book a meeting with me uh
for flip bites so this is exactly what
was intended and if you go to the end of
call report that is the Google sheet you
can see the summary of the call so it's
right here just buy a Rob the number is
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and it summarized
everything so it says Rob called flip BS
ai ai agency seeking a a solution oh
sorry not a voice but a voice solution
and the call concluded with air
confirming drops contact information and
promising to sent a cand lead link which
it did and you have all the other
information as well so you can see the
transcript here as well of the call you
have a link and you can click on this
thing and uh you can actually hear the
the actual call itself and uh okay and
this is the status which is resolved
which is true because the call actually
happened was not a fail and then of
course the email which is hello flip
b.co so it captures all those things and
this is what we will be actually seeing
in this video how to uh build a system
which sends an email out and then of
course has an end of call report as well
okay so let's see how to do that
and just like that the air answer all
the questions send out a canly link
using email and summarized all the call
details in the Google sheet so whether
you're running an agency a restaurant
real estate business or working as a
lawyer doctor dentist or any other
profession AI voice agents can function
as a virtual receptionist they can
handle calls inform callers about your
product or Services book appointments
take orders and much more the
possibilities for automation are endless
helping you streamline your workflow
boost your productivity and save you a
lot of money in the process also I've
been building AI voice agents for my
clients for a few months now and I've
explored W's many features so in this
video in addition to building the
receptionist I also want to go over all
the important Wy settings and explain
when and how to use them essentially I
want this video to serve as a reference
guide for anyone looking to build an AI
voice app showing you how to maximize
the potential of Wy okay if you're
watching my video for the first time and
don't know who I am my name is sandep
kesta I have over two decades of
experience in Building Technology
different systems and have worked with
multiple Fortune 500 companies I also
hold double master's degrees from Top us
universities now I run my a agency
called flip bite where we help
businesses with automations using AI to
help streamline their workflow uh get
them more clients boost their
productivity and save them money all
right here are the topics we'll be
covering in this video first we'll start
with a brief overview on what is voice
Ai and how it works next we'll go over
the wppi dashboard and I'll provide an
OV of the platform then we will create
an assistant and we'll go through every
setting in each tab including choosing a
model
transcriber voice functions advanced
settings and call analysis next is the
phoneone number setup and I'll show you
how to add a phone number using
twio after that is the files tab also
known as the knowledge base and I'll
show you how to add files to create a
knowledge base from scratch and then use
it in the system we are creating the
tools section is the key section that
lets W take actions such as adding
client's detail to CRM sending emails or
sending a candly link and so on next we
will briefly go over blocks and squads
and I'll give you a brief explanation of
what they are and how to use them after
that we will see the voice library and
how to get different voices for your
project including creating and importing
your own voice and lastly I'll show you
logs where you can see all the call
details including transcriptions
summaries Etc so there you go that's the
plan also at the end of each section
we'll apply what we have learned to
build our AI receptionist this way
you'll not only understand the settings
but also know how to use them
practically this will be a comprehensive
step-by-step video for building a basic
AI inbound call agent or an AI
receptionist which should suffice for
70% of the business cases however if
your requirements are more advanced I
suggest joining our flip bites AI
Community where you'll meet other voice
a enthusiasts who can help you or you
can book a free Discovery call with my
agency flip bite where we can discuss
your project I'll leave the link to join
the community or to book a call with my
jensy in the description for now now
close all your tabs grab a cup of coffee
or your favorite drink and let's get
started don't forget to add this video
to your favorites so you can easily come
back to it later for reference as always
all the templates links documents prompt
Etc which I use in this video will be
available on the resource Hub also this
is a long video so my suggestion is that
if there's a part you want me to explain
or a topic you want me to cover in the
future videos pause this video and write
down your comments in the section below
so you don't forget and miss it okay
let's go to Step One what is voice AI
well voice AI refers to a system that is
designed to interact with humans using
spoken language you've probably already
encountered it in everyday life uh think
about Voice air systems like Siri Alexa
or even automated customer service
systems these systems use ACC
combination Technologies speech to text
to understand what we say and natural
language processing to interpret that
information and then back to text to
speech to respond back to the user next
how does voice air work so let's break
down how this all works in the voice
orchestration model when you talk to a
voice assistant your spoken words are
first turned into text using something
called a speech to text engine this
engine might be powered by services like
deep gram whisper or some other service
then this text is processed by AI models
such as open AI or anthropic or some
other large language model which
interprets the meaning and context of
your words after that the AI process is
what you have said and it generates a
response this response is then sent back
as text which is then again converted
into speech by a text to speech engine
uh something like a 11 Labs or a play HD
the key challenge has always been making
these steps happen fast enough to feel
like a natural
conversation okay now let's go to the W
voice a platform we start with the
dashboard which provides a breakdown and
Analysis of your calls it gives you a
quick snapshot of how calls are
performing within your organization you
can view key metrics such as total call
minutes number of calls total spent
average calls per sorry average cost per
call reason call ended and average call
duration by the assistant this ovie
helps you monitor call activity and
performance at a
glance okay now let me create an
assistant so that I can walk you through
all the assistant settings as well as
configure it as we go along to create an
assistant click on create a assistant
button you can choose a predefined
template or you can go with a blank
template I will choose a blank template
so that I can explain all the settings
for the assistant name since I'm
creating it for my agency sorry my AI
agency I will call it flip bites AI
agent now our AI assistant is created
okay the first tab is the model this
section lets you set up the model for
your assistant first message this is the
initial message the assistant will say
when someone calls you can either write
the message or provide a URL to an audio
file MP3 file wave Etc it acts as a
greeting for the caller the system
prompt the system prompt is where you
set the context role personality and
instructions for your assistant this is
the most important part because it tells
the AI exactly what you expect from it
creating clear and specific prompt is
crucial for getting the right output
from the model I can make a detailed
video on prompt engineering for voice AI
systems if you're interested just leave
a comment below if there's enough
interest I'll break it down and explain
how to craft a perfect prompt okay next
is provider and model here you can
choose the language model provider such
as open AI enthropy or Gro the model you
choose will depend on the provider for
our flip a agency example we'll use open
a GPD 4 which I found to work best so
far okay knowledge base in this section
you can select the knowledge base you
want to use we haven't set up one yet so
we'll come back to this part later after
creating the knowledge base temperature
this setting controls how creative or
predictable the assistants response are
a higher temperature results in more
creative responses while a lower
temperature which is close to zero makes
the output more focused and predictable
if you want the system to strictly
answer word for word uh from the
knowledge base set the temperature to
zero personally I prefer keeping it
around3 to4 which allows the assistant
to reference the knowledge base but
still add a bit of creative flare keep
in mind the higher the temperature the
more likely the assistant will generate
off topic or hallucinated responses okay
Max tokens this setting limits the
number of tokens or words the assistant
can generate in each conversation for
voice AI it is best to keep responses
short and concise so I recommend setting
it around 250 to 300 tokens any higher
and the assistant might generate overly
lendy responses detect emotion now
enable this feature to detect the user's
emotion like anger or joy and add that
as an extra context for the assistant to
improve its
responses okay now let's configure the
flip bites AI agent for the first
message we will simply say hi there
thanks for calling flip by geny we
specialize in AI automation to boost
your business how can assist you today
next is the provider and the model so
our agent will use the provider as open
Ai and the model as GPD 40 because in my
experience it has worked best but feel
free to play around with other models
for your project okay for the knowledge
base um once I create it I will attach
it to the assistant uh for temperature I
will keep it at Point uh 4 to have the
right balance of the AI Crea flare and
uh I will keep Max tokens as 300 so the
answers are short and crisp and I'll
keep the delete emotion switched off as
I don't want it okay finally the system
prompt I've created a system prompt for
flip btes and I will share it with you
in the source up however here's a brief
overview on how to create a system
prompt the main thing is that you need
to tell the AI who it is and what it
needs to do so for flip bites first I
have to I have specified that it is uh
it's an AI voice agent second you need
to give instructions on what it should
do so in this case it should answer all
the questions and then ask the users U
its name uh you sorry users name email
and phone number if they are interested
to schedule a free Discovery call third
if there are any function calls and we
will cover that shortly you need to
specify it here in the correct order so
that the AI can take the necessary
action and fourth is Give an example
script of the conversation this really
helps the AI so as I mentioned earlier
writing a system prompt is a detailed
process and I would be happy to create a
video dedicated for creating great
system prompts okay so if you want that
please pause this video and and leave a
comment below okay the next section is
transcriber so the transcriber is a
speech to text engine and converts audio
into text so that we can send the
questions to the AI there are various
providers you can use to handle this
okay so like you have deep gram you have
open AI you have
tasbe so after choosing a provider you
need to select a model offered by that
provider uh such as you have NOA 2 for
deepgram uh however if you choose a
provider as Tas cribe the only available
model is whisper so the main purpose of
this section which is transcriber is to
turn spoken speech into text to give to
the AI all right so for our sorry for
our agent I will use the provider as
deep gram the language as English and
the model as NOA 2 all right the next
section is the voice section this part
is about converting the Air's response
from text to speech so that the user can
hear it there are many voice providers
like Cartia and 11 labs and you can
choose the voice that works best for you
providers like 11 Labs even let you
upload your own voice you can record
your voice on their platform upload it
through the API to Wy and use your voice
in your AI system okay so if you're
interested I can make a video showing uh
showing you how to do this just let me
know in the comments below okay so when
choosing a voice be sure to keep the
latency which is the delay as low as
possible for a smooth conversation the
higher the latency the longer the AI
assistant takes to respond okay
so uh okay so first pick the
provider and the voice you want to
use so in the additional settings you
can configure the background sound you
can also decide if you want background
sounds like the noise of a busy office
to give you the caller sorry to give the
callor a sense of an active environment
personally I'm not a big fan of it but
by default phone calls have an office
background while web calls have it
turned off and you can change that from
the drop- down input minimum characters
now this sets the minimum number of
characters sent to the voice provider it
helps decide the size of the text Chunk
for generating The Voice by default it
is 10 okay punctuation boundaries these
are the punctuations that are considered
valid D limiters this helps decide the
chunks that are sent to the voice
provider for voice generation as the llm
tokens are streaming in even though I've
not used them the common punctuations
are commas and pipes filler injection
enabl this decides if uh filter sorry
fillers like um and O uh are added to
make the speech sound more natural like
in nor uh normal conversation you know
people generally use arms and rs so if
you want that a assistant to use these
filler words as well you can switch on
the setting uh and it will exactly do
that well this is uh off by default back
channeling enabled this B the bot can
say things like M or yeah while
listening to the user to make the
conversation sound more natural this is
again uh off by
default and the last is background d d
ionizing enabled this setting filters
out the background noise while the user
is speaking this is again off by default
okay for the flip bites AI assistant
I'll select the provider as aure and the
voice as Andrew okay the rest of the
settings I'll keep uh default so default
background sounds and nothing enabled
but feel free to play around with these
to get the perfect AI Voice
output all right next up is function
call
now let's talk about function calling
this is one of the most important parts
of the system because it connects wppi
to the outside world with function
calling you can do things like send
emails update CRM or perform any action
you need all while the call isn't
progress or when the call ends if you
give multiple instructions in the system
prompt the AI will perform the first
action then the second third and so on
for our flipy agency example we can have
the assistant U you know ask for user's
name name phone number email and then
send them uh an email with the candal
link also we will configure the end of
call report where the AI will summarize
the full conversation and output that
into the Google sheet so if you want to
make the system more advanced you could
also do things like uh you can check if
the caller is an existing customer and
then do a certain action uh second you
can actually do something like pull the
customer's data from a CRM and then
personalize the whole conversation
according to them or third you could
have separate workflows for new or
existing users so the possibilities are
endless and can be tailored to your
business needs I won't cover this more
advanced setup in this video but if
you'd like a tutorial on handling both
new and existing customers using vapy
leave a comment below you uh could also
schedule a free Discovery call with my
agency to discuss your project okay next
is tools so tools allow your voice Bots
to perform specific actions uh sorry
task during a call you can add tools
from tools library to connect your Bots
with a workflow for platform like
make.com or go high level you can also
create custom tools using your own
backend okay predefined
functions enable end call function allow
the assistant to end the call on its own
you know so best for gbd4 or larger
models and then you have dial keypad
which lets the assistant dial numbers on
the keypad it is off by
default after that is your forwarding
phone number so W's call forwarding
functionality allows you to redirect
calls to a different phone number this
is the number the assistant will use to
transfer the call and this only applies
to phone calls not web calls so this is
something which you need to understand
okay and end of call phrases Now by
default the wapy assistant doesn't end
call on its own however you can set up
uh you know end of call phrases like
goodbye or talk to you soon to signal
that the assistant should disconnect you
can add multiple and of called phrases
here separate by commas and whenever the
user says any of these words or phrases
the bot will end the call finally
there's custom functions custom
functions operate similar to tools but
follow an older format based on the a uh
open AI specifications however there's
no need to use custom functions since
you'll be utilizing tools instead so
it's basically one of the same thing and
we will be using tools okay
next is the advanced settings okay
privacy hiaa compliance Hippa uh which
is health insurance portability and
accountability Act is a US law that
ensures that privacy and security of
medical information any organization uh
handling protected health information
you know which is called Phi must follow
Hippa guidelines to keep patients data
safe so when this setting is enabled no
logs recording or transcriptions will be
stored if you are developing an AI voice
solution in USA for medical
practitioners you definitely need to
activate this and get more information
on Hippa so you are compliant audio
recording this setting will record the
conversation with the assistant video
recording so turns video recording on or
off during a web call this records your
users video okay now let's configure
these setting for our flip bites
assistant since flip bites is an agency
I don't have to worry about the Hippa
compliance so that is off I will switch
on the audio recording because I want to
record the conversation with the
assistant and the video recording uh
stays off okay next is the start
speaking plan now this plan controls
when the assistant should start talking
okay wait time before speaking this
setting sets how long the assistant
Waits after the customer finishes
talking uh the default is4 seconds but
you can adjust it if the assistant speak
too quickly or waits too
long all right smart endp pointing this
detects when the customer has really
finished speaking even if they pause
mids sentence it's off by default but
you can be turned on uh if needed
transcription based detection you
customize how the assistant detects that
the customer has finished talking based
on the content of their speech for more
precise control so you can have on
punctuation seconds uh which is the
minimum seconds to wait after
transcription ending with punctuation uh
on no punctuation seconds which is the
minimum seconds to wait after
transcription ending without punctuation
and the last is on number seconds which
is the minimum seconds to wait after
transcription ending with a number so
now for a flip bites agency I'll go with
the default values which is 0.4 seconds
uh for weit seconds smart end pointing
off and
0.1 for on punctuation seconds 1.5 for
on uh no punctuation seconds and 0.5 for
on number seconds all right so the next
is the stop speaking
plan first is the number of words now in
this setting you can set how many words
the customer needs to say before the
assistant stops talking you can set it
to zero for immediate reaction or
increase it to avoid interruptions
during short responses like
okay voice seconds this is the voice AC
ity detection you can set how long the
customer must talk before the assistant
stops the default is 2 seconds but you
can adjust this to avoid false
triggers and uh back off seconds now
that controls how long the assistant
waits to start talking again after being
interrupted the default is 1 second but
you can adjust it depending on how fast
you want the system to respond for our
geny it will be zero for number of
words2 for voice seconds and one for or
back off
seconds okay call timeout settings
silence timeout this sets uh how long
the assistant Waits before ending a call
due to silence and the next is maximum
duration this sets the maximum length of
a call U Can last so for flip bites what
are uh what we'll do is it will be 30
seconds for silence time out and 1,800
seconds which is approximately half an
hour for maximum duration
okay messaging so these are settings for
messages sent to and from the assistant
okay the first is server URL now this is
a URL W uses to send and receive
messages via HTTP post requests so it
helps W retrieve context call functions
and generate call reports server URLs
allow your app to uh you know receive
status updates about the call get
transcript updates trigger function
calls when the assistant needs to
perform actions receive assistant
request for dynamic configuration get an
end of call report receive notification
if the assistant stops responding and
for more complex setups server URS can
also provide real-time conversation data
to your back
end all right voicemail messages this is
the message that the assistant will say
if the call goes to the
voicemail end call message and this is
the message the system will say when the
call ends
idle
messages messages that the assistant
will say if the user hasn't responded
you can select one or more from the
drop-down so you
have Max idle message this sets the
maximum number of times the system
repeat idle messages during the call and
idle timeout set the number in seconds
before an idle message is spoke all
right for flip bites I'm not using the
server URL as of now but we will be
using it later in the video so I will
leave it empty for now okay for client
and server messages I will go with the
default values for the voicemail message
uh let's add hey this is sandip from
flip bites AI please call back when
you're available and for the end of call
message let me add thanks for reaching
out to flip bites AI it was great
assisting you have a wonderful day for
the max idle messages we will leave the
default
values okay and finally we have the
analysis tab so the call analysis
feature helps you summarize and evaluate
calls you know offering useful insights
into how effective the calls were we
will be using summary uh success
evaluation and structured data for our
flip by agent so we can get the end of
call report and we will write that into
Google sheet to sort of create a call
dashboard this will help us know uh how
the AI agent is handling the calls and
how to prove them okay let's have a
closer look summary this is the prompt
uh which will be used to create a short
summary of The call so uh here's the
prompt you are expert notaker summarize
the given transcript of a call summarize
the call in two to three sentences if
applicable the output will be stored in
call. analysis. summary and you can also
find it in the call logs page let me
show you that uh where you can find that
so now if you go to logs and then you
click on the
call you can see all the details of that
call including logs trans scripts and
messages Etc however in our example we
will extract this data and add that to
the Google sheet okay the next is
Success evaluation now this evaluates
whether a call was successful or not you
can use a rubric a success valuation
prompt or both now if you if both are
used they are combined into a set of
instructions so now we will use this
success evaluation prompt uh you an
expert call evaluator you will be given
a transcript of a call and the system
prompt of the AI participant determine
if the call was successful based on the
objectives inferred from the system
prompt all
right success evaluation rubric the
rubric defines how the success of a call
is measured these are the sorry these
are the available rubrics number one is
numerical scale which rates are from 1
to 10 descriptive scale rates as
excellent coulde fair or poor checklist
a list of criteria with their stat is
Matrix a grid evaluating multiple
criteria at different levels percentage
scale rates from 0 to 100% like scale
rates from strongly agree to strongly
disagree automatic rubric breaks down
evaluation into different criteria each
with its own score pass fail it's true
or sorry it's simple true or false to
indicate if the call
passed okay structured data the
structured data prompt extracts specific
information from the call and stores it
into call. analysis. structur Data now
this is great when you want to extract
user data such as users name his phone
number email or any other data that the
user gives during the call okay to
extract the data you first need to add a
property such as a name and then add a
description then in the prompt you can
add uh something in the prompt you can
say extract the name that the caller
gave us in the name property field what
this will do is this will extract the
user's name and store it and you can
then extract it later you need to do the
same thing that is you need to create a
schema and write a prompt for every
property you want so if you want an
email or if you want to extract their
phone number you need to add a property
for phone number and then add a prompt
for that and then same thing for email
if you want the email you need to First
create a property for that and then
mention that in the prompt okay that
wraps up the AI assistant configuration
now our AI assistant more or less done
let's move to the next section which is
getting a phone number I've already
covered this topic in another video so
I'm going to add that video snippet here
and it will walk you through how to buy
a phone number in twio and then import
that into the W platform all right let's
see how that is done uh so there are two
options basically one is that you can
buy a phone number from um sorry from uh
wppi so from W you can actually only buy
phone numbers which are from US and
Canada all right and there are two other
options the the second option is that
you if you have a twio account and twio
again is I'll just show it to you this
is twio for communication it has amazing
apis and everything for communication
but it also has a feature wherein you
can actually buy a number and it you the
numbers available for US Canada
Australia a lot of other countries as
well so if you are outside US and Canada
then you can actually probably look at
uh twio or wage so I don't I don't have
a w account I don't have wage basically
but I do have a twio account okay so I'm
going to show you how to buy a number in
twio and then connect it to uh W's AI
assistant so let's go to twilio and this
is twio I'm going to go I have an
account so basically I'm going to log in
but if you don't uh create an account
very it's pretty straightforward once
you create an account you'll come to the
Account dashboard right here okay and
once you and this is where you will
actually so in order to buy a number uh
you'll go to manage and within manage
there's something called buyer number
okay and uh again for the purpose of
this video I'm going to buy a US number
only and you can select the number you
want uh pretty much like you know if you
know the area code let's say if you want
New York you can do 212 646 depending on
the availability you will get a choice
if in case they are not available then
of course you will not get that area
code all right perfect so I'm going to
buy one of these numbers so I'm just
going to go ahead and buy and it's going
to ask you this is the number which
you're buying are you okay with it so
I'm just doing it for the demo right now
so I'm just going to show you how to do
that 1 14 this number is
done I'm going to say byy that's
it and that's like that have youve
purchased this particular number and now
it should show in your active
numbers okay and this is what I bought
right here you can see this okay so now
I'm going to pick up this number okay
and let's go to w sorry let's go to uh
Wy and then out here in twio just say
the phone number just paste the number
out here This Is Us number you need your
T accounts SSID and Au token so for that
I'm going to go to the Account
dashboard okay so I'm going to copy
account SS
ID and then I'm going to copy Au
token and I can
say
uh
vapi SFO San Francisco okay
bfo and then say import from too all
right so let's
import and there you go so you see the
number right here that's it okay so vapy
SFO and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to connect it with an
assistant next let's go to the knowledge
base okay a knowledge base is a
collection of files that an AI assistant
can access to provide more detailed and
accurate responses during conversations
so you can upload documents like PDF or
images example jpegs and your assistant
will use them for extra content sorry
context so why use a knowledge base well
integrating a knowledge base with your
voice AI assistant offers several
advantages the first one is it improves
accuracy and it helps your assistant
provide upto-date and precise
information second is enhanced
capabilities it allows your assistant to
answer more complex questions and give
detailed responses and the third is
customizations so you can ta uh sorry
you can tailor the assistant's responses
to specific topics or areas by using
custom documents now how to create a
knowledge base it is very simple to
create a knowledge base in W so the
first step is to upload the documents
now go to files and upload your custom
files in formats like markdown PDF uh
plain text Microsoft Word and so on so
forth I only have one PDF file uh for
FAQ for my uh knowledge base but you can
add multiple files as well all right
once you do that your knowledge base is
created now the next step is which is
step two is to connect your knowledge
base to your assistant okay so that is
uh to your W assistant and step three is
to configure your assistant so what
you'll do is once it's connected you
adjust the assistant uh system prompt to
make sure that it uses the knowledge
base when responding to user
queries okay the best practices for
creating an effective knowledge base is
is one organize your documents so
arrange them by topic or category so
that the assistant can find the right
information quickly number two is use
Clear language so keep your documents
clear and concise for better
understanding and response accuracy and
the third is that keep your documents
updated regularly updating your files to
ensure the assistant gives the most
current and accurate information another
thing is that you don't have to go
through W's uh knowledge base okay so if
you have you can also create a custom
knowledge base so if you prefer not to
use W's inbuilt knowledge base you can
set up your own this can be done
directly in a platform this sorry this
cannot be done directly in a platform it
and it must be handled via code you can
create a custom knowledge Base by
connecting your own server which will
then handle all the knowledge requests
okay next let's briefly talk about
blocks and squads now blocks and squads
are Advanced topics and not a part of
this video however I just wanted to give
you a brief overview so blocks are the
building unit in a conversational
workflow that help design and manage
interactions so each step in a workflow
contains one block which defines the
action at that stage of the conversation
okay blocks are currently in beta and if
you want to know more about it and want
me to do a video on how blocks work and
how to use them let me know in the
comments next is Squad squads are a
workflow tool that lets you connect
multiple assistant into a single
workflow each assistant can be fully
configured to use existing tools prompts
and set settings or you can customize
them with unique overr rights squads are
idal for managing complex workflows and
tasks okay so instead of placing all the
functionality in one assistant squads
let you break down larger more complex
workflows into smaller specialized
assistants each assistant in a squad
handles a specific part of the
conversation for example one assistant
might qualify a lead and if they are
qualified another assistant might take
that over and book an appointment and
yet another can write down all the
details of that lead into a RM and so on
an a driven call center would be a good
example of using squads if you want to
know more about squads or want me to do
a video on how to use sads with multiple
assistants pause this video and let me
know in the comments below okay next I
want to briefly touch on The Voice
library now in the voice Library you can
import voices from 11 Labs playhd or
many other providers after you import a
voice you can use that voice in your
agent now to import voices you need to
enter your provider credentials and once
you do that you can import all the
voices from that provider whether it's
11 Labs playhd or others directly into
your W platform so in 11 Labs you can
also clone your own voice and then
import it into wpp to use for your
agents now this is especially useful if
you want to use your own voice for
answering questions or booking
appointments if you like me to make a
video on how to clone your voice in 11
labs and then import it into to and
sorry and use that in W as well let me
know in the comments just a quick note I
hope you're finding this video helpful
and if you are please give it a thumbs
up and drop a comment below making these
videos takes a lot of time and effort so
your support really helps the channel
and encourages me to keep making more
cont content sorry like this for you
also I firmly believe that air
automation can be transformative for
many businesses so on this channel my
goal is to create many more videos where
I show you step by step how to use AI to
automate business workflows and
processes to boost your productivity so

so you never miss out when I post a new
video if you like to work with us you
can schedule a 30-minute free Discovery
call with me I'll leave all the links in
the description okay let's get back to
our
video all right so the final section is
the tool section and uh you know we have
already covered the assistance phone
number files blocks squads voice library
and everything okay so the final section
is tool section and uh uh so I've
already created a tool out here called
email can lead link and what this tool
does is essentially it sends an email
out okay and uh but before I actually go
into how to create a tool and explain
you all the stuff let me just take you
to assistance right now and show you
exactly how tools and where tools are
used so when you create a tool a tool is
nothing but uh it is basically to do a
task uh outside of Wy environment so
when you want to send an email out via
Gmail through W you will use a tool
which actually connects via an an agent
which is something like a make or a
zapia and uh then it sends an email out
or if in case you want to write
something to a CRM okay and they can be
endless tasks basically so for that you
will use tools now once you create a
tool uh you will come here in this
section functions and then you connect
it out here so let me just go to flip by
agent and if you see functions right
here you can see you can see all the
tools right here and then you can select
the ones which are pertaining to your
assistant all right and uh in this you
have email candy link and the next part
is in the model in the prompt so in the
prompt as you can see we have when a
person when a user calls the AI agent
the AI agent will first greet the user
uh that's the instruction second thing
is it will actually answer all the
questions what the user poses and the
last is that if the user is interested
in actually scheduling a call then what
the AI agent is going to do is is going
to ask their first name phone number
including code and email address okay
once it gets all this uh all this
information it will confirm that and
then it will do a function call now this
is a function call if you can see send
Cy link this is the same this needs to
be the same as your tool name uh as in
the function call out here and the
function call out here okay all of those
places all right so now we can go back
to Tool because we have some context now
all right so in order to create a tool
it's pretty straightforward just go and
cl click on new tool you you have a
choice of Provider you can create a
custom tool you can create make or you
can create go high level now go high
level is a CRM it's integrated uh but
for our video we'll use make now just to
give you some context what is make in
case you don't know that so now make is
a connecting uh agent sort of like when
you you have a v environment okay this
is a voice a platform and you want to
send an email via Gmail which is a
totally different application now how do
you how do they talk to each other and
that is what we makeup comes in you talk
to each other while make okay so make
essentially is uh is an application
which connects different applications so
whether you want to uh you know let's
say you want to take some information
from wppi and you want to add it to a
CRM which is HubSpot so then again you
can use make or you want to write
something to Google sheet you can again
use make so the make if you go to the
platform right now let me just uh take
you right there it's called
make.com okay and that's what it does it
connects app app s so if you can see
right here is the platform you have apps
and services so they have got like a lot
of apps so you can connect different uh
so helpspot CRM LinkedIn you want to
write something to CRM or if something
happens in LinkedIn let's say somebody
uh creates a post in LinkedIn and you
want it automatically to email somebody
else you can do all those things you can
basically connect different apps that's
what make does okay connect anything so
anyways coming back to um W so this is
what we'll do and uh in order to create
a tool we need a server URL now what is
a server URL now let's go to make and
within make once you actually create an
account you will come to the section and
within scenarios okay so you can see all
the scenarios right here I'm just going
to open the one which I have which is
Fitness uh sorry flip by agent and email
Cy link okay this is the one and you can
create a new scenario uh also but I'm
I've already created this one so I'm
just going to explain this okay so the
first thing is the web hook now what is
a web hook a web Hook is like a program
which is uh looking for information it's
polling information okay so this is the
URL now what you do is the first thing
you do is you actually go here and you
add a web hook and once you click on
this button it's going to add this and
once it comes here then you can add you
can click on this thing and then you can
name uh your web hook anything in our
case it is you know I'm creating an uh
I'm creating this for flip btes in web
hook I'm saying byes email agent sorry
uh flip byes agent and email cly link so
this is exactly what it is out here and
once you do that it will create a web
hook and it'll add this uh you know this
URL so you need to copy this URL and
you'll go out here and you'll paste this
okay and then you say save and next now
when you do this what happens is that
every time this function is called so
let's say during a call the user says
hey uh this is my first name this is my
email address what is going to happen is
the moment you say that within the
function call as you saw in the prompt
it is going to call this uh function
okay so because this because of this URL
it is going to send information out here
saying that hey uh this is the
information and then this is going to
capture this information so that is what
a web Hook is it actually captures
information and then it is going to pass
this to the gmail which has uh you know
all the details like uh it has thanks
for calling so this is email body this
is uh the email address and all the
things so I'm going to show this to you
exactly how it works but just to give
you an overview this is the web hook and
it is connected to Gmail now how do you
connect it to gmail you connect it from
here so you can actually just go out
here and you can connect it to Gmail
Google Sheets or whatever you want I
mean there there are like 2,000 apps out
here or probably more all right so once
you do this this is connected now every
time uh you know so let me just go here
I've already created this so I'm just
going to okay so let's go to the email
candly link okay so once you create the
function you'll come here so let's go to
integration and if you can see in the
integration this is the server URL this
is exactly the same URL which is this
one okay all right
so I'm going to save this all right so
once you create this after that you need
to add properties so you will say tool
name and you can name it any way you
want I generally use the nomenclature
uncore email so that at least I know
this is a user defined rather than a
system find uh tool name but yeah you
can actually use anything whatever you
want the tool description is extremely
important because it tells wppi what is
this function doing like you know so in
this case this function will get the
user's first name phone number and email
address and then send them an email from
flip bites with the Catal link so this
is what it's telling W that this is
exactly what the function does it's
supposed to capture these three things
so where is it going to capture so that
is when you actually write properties
okay so in properties I've put in the
name email phone number and you can
write more you can actually add many
more properties whatever your use case
is so if you want to say that okay
whether it wrote to a CRM or uh you want
to say something else basically capture
their WhatsApp number or uh you know
whatever it is anything else so you can
write those properties and then you can
Define the kind of property it is like
in this case it is a string uh but if
it's a phone number it's a number and
email is again a string name is a string
and so on and so forth a string is
nothing but but it's text all right and
if it's a phone number then it's number
and then of course you have to write the
description as well so remember the
description is very important it
basically tells Wy what this property is
what is this field so it says first name
of the user so email ID of the user so
all of these things this is what is
telling W that these are the properties
and this is the function which has these
properties okay all right so now let's
test this so in order to test this what
I'm going to do is whether it's working
or not
I'm going to start this so now I'm
running this okay now let's go back to
and uh this is our function call so I'm
going to go to
assistant right
here and within the call itself it's
supposed to actually invoke this one it
so what is going to happen is when the
call is going on it is going to ask me
all this information and when it
confirms all this information the Second
Step it is going to call the function
right and that is when you'll get all
the information right here so let's test
this okay so I'm just going to run this
right
now hi there thanks for calling flip
bites AI agency we specialize in AI
automation to boost your business how
can I assist you today hey John I'm
interested in actually getting a an AI
chat bot for my
business awesome you're in the right
place our AI chat Bots are designed to
elevate customer support and automate
routine interactions would you like to
set up a free consultation to discuss
this further yeah sure why
not great let's get started can I get
your first name phone number including
country code an email address I'll send
you a link to book a consultation at
your convenience sounds good so my name
is John and my phone number is +
one12 3 4 5 6 78 and my email is hello
at flip bites. that is h e l l f
LBT
s.co did you get that got
it all right let's confirm everything
name John phone number +12
345678 email hello flip bites. company
is that all correct uh no my email is
flip b.co that Isco
got it let me correct that so your email
is hello flip b.co that's h l l f
LBT s.co is that right that's
right perfect I'll send you a link to
book your consultation I'll get that
link over to you in a jiffy one
moment all said John goodbye you're
wel goodbye have a a great day and feel
free to reach out if okay so that's it
basically so you saw that this is
working so when actually it calls a
function okay and then as you can see
right here uh we've already received the
email as you saw if you go here and I
can see right here okay and this is the
email right here with the call with the
with the link and so if you click the
link it directly takes you to okay so
this is the link all
right okay uh so this is a function
called basically so this is like just
one example in our for example we are
just using this to send an email out but
you can do multiple things you can
actually as I said add it to a CRM sends
a WhatsApp message send SMS do whatever
you want okay and there are 2,000 apps
and so you can really create a pretty
complicated or a comprehensive workflow
all right so as you saw like once it
runs it sends all the information right
here so you can see all this information
right within the message itself it has
timestamp it has tool scal now if you go
and keep on opening it it has all the
details so this is the can this is the
function this is the argument so you
have John you have hello flip bites and
you have the phone number as well all
right and now this is sent to your uh
Gmail and so in Gmail when you say
address and the first time when you're
doing it when you click on this you just
need to actually go here in the tools
and then function and arguments and then
you have it out here basically so in
this case you will just pick up this um
email portion and then you just drag it
here okay and that's it so this is the
email address
uh similarly you will put in the first
name out here so that I'm saying hi John
and the reason I'm using this P this is
basically HTML tags if you don't use
HTML tags what's going to happen is it's
going to lump everything into one uh you
know paragraph and you don't want that
so if you want an email like this which
comes directly like this so basically
what you'll do is you'll just go uh go
to chat GPT put in your email say that
add HTML tags and then whatever output
is just input it out here and that's it
so so this is exactly and say it says
that it you can use HTML tag so use that
all right so this is pretty much it so
this is exactly how you can create a
function call okay all right so the last
thing remaining which was the end of
call report once the call finishes you
want this end of call report to be
updated with the call uh call summary so
it will actually add everything it'll
add the call summary it'll add the
transcript what happened and so on so
forth okay so in order to do that what
you need to do is you need to do of
things so now there's nothing so we have
finished with the tools section now
let's go back to the
assistant and we'll go in advanc now in
advanced you will see a function
basically when you go down there's
something called messaging right here
okay and it in messaging you have a
server URL now what is this server URL
oh sorry this is the one Advanced I was
in the different
assistant all right so in this case
basically I'm using this server URL okay
and you need to
specify what is it that you want now
what you'll do is you'll go back to next
there's another scenario which we'll use
which is called this one so this is the
end of call report for that you will use
another web hook so again in order to
use a web hook you will again go here
you can add a webook right here okay so
when you click on this thing I've again
called it um flip bytes end of call
report okay and once you do that once
you create so in order to add that again
as I said it's very easy just click on
ADD and then you name it the way you
want whatever you want the nomenclature
you want and after that just says save
what it's going to happen is it will
generate this link and then you copy
this link okay let's go back and out
here in the server URL I'm just going to
show this
again all right so these are two
different server URLs so if you see this
is the same one okay so you will use it
out here because again what it does is
This Server URL tells vippy that okay
the call is over now okay and so take
all this data which the user given which
which is the phone the the name the
phone number the email and you know the
transcript what the user spoke all that
data basically collect that and send it
to this particular URL okay so this is
the existing data which is like the data
which we just had a call about so if you
open this you can actually see
everything right here so this is all the
details you have the Tim stamp it has
type of end of call report and then it
has got the summary John called flip
bites AI to inquire about getting an AI
CH chatbot for his business the AI
representative offered so it basically
tells the the what exactly with the
conversation about and this is really
really helpful especially when you would
actually you know when you put a
solution as an AI receptionist uh into
your business or for your client and
everything and then you need to know how
many calls were there what exactly
happened how did the AI respond so you
can kind of tweak it as well basically
so if you go to the AI report now you
can see it's right here all right so
this is exactly what happened here are
the two three sentence summ John called
flip by AI agency to inquire about about
getting an air chatbot for his business
the air representative offered to set up
a free consultation and collected John's
contact information including the name
phone number and email address after
confirming the details the a
representative promised to send John a
link to book the consultation which it
did okay and this is the actual
transcription so it's the whole trans
the so the transcript uh transcript
sorry of the phone call and uh you have
a URL as well so basically if you click
this it will take you to the recording
and you can actually listen to the
recording as well all right so yeah so
this is pretty much what it does now
this is the end of call report okay so
once you're here okay so then this is
this is this has got all that
information now when we configuring this
why do we need to do this all right so
as you saw when you get the information
it sends you a lot of information okay
so obviously you cannot put all this
information into Google sheet you can if
you want to but generally you don't want
to okay so that has a lot of information
because things which you don't need you
have cost you have end reason you have
end at start at I don't know I like a
lot of things basically cost breakdown
there's way too much data so what you
need is you want to filter all this
information and you want only couple of
things to reach Google sheet so in your
Google sheet you basically will map
those columns all right so what you do
is you add a Google sheet you first add
a router basically a router the reason
you add a router is so that you can add
a filter now this filter what it does is
basically all the data which is coming
in through the web hook it it actually
uh filters all that stuff okay and it
only lets couple of things pass or
whatever you specify out here so as I
said end of call report in the message
type now once you do that after that
basically you have in this particular
one so you add a Google sheet and then
uh you know you actually go so in my
case the Go sheet is in Shar Global air
receptionist and of call report and
wherever the path is basically so your
Google sheet path you put it out here
the sheet name you'll put it out here
and once you do that that it will
actually get everything okay and then
you need to so I have not put in the
name here I probably forgot to put the
name here so that then probably doesn't
have the
name yep it doesn't have the name right
here so that is the reason it doesn't
have the name because I did not added
out here so you see this is the blank
and in the phone number also this is
this is this is gibberish okay so oh
sorry this is the ID I put the ID
instead all right so you saw firsthand
what exactly happens let me just go and
correct that uh all right so
this says table content header okay so
the name so name when I click on this
thing I
have okay so yes it is an analysis
structured data now if you
remember okay let me just open this and
show it to you structured data okay so
why is this coming here so all of this
thing is right here you have the name
you have the email you have the phone
number so let's go back to Wy okay and
if you remember when we go to assistant
within the assistant itself uh you know
when you go here we had actually set up
all of these things right so earlier in
the video I showed you this prompt for
summary for Success evaluation and for
structured data and we had specified
structured data here right so we had
said that okay this is the name property
add property this is the name email and
phone number so this is different than
the tools this is the end of call report
okay so it can you can actually add much
more out here basically because if you
want capture more information you can
add this out here as well but you know
uh so anyways so what we we are we
wanted to capture is I want to capture
the name email and phone number so I
could add that in the report and for
that I did this so I added the
description as well for each one of them
and then I added a prompt as well so it
says extract the name of the caller
basically gave it to us uh the name in
the name property field so what it does
is that within the call when the call is
going on it actually takes the name
extracts that and puts that into the
name column so that is the reason we
have all that data right here okay so
when I go here I can so now if I want
that to be captured what I'll do is I'll
just pick this up and I'll put it right
here okay so now the next time when it
runs it is it knows that okay within the
name field I need to put data from here
and there is an email field as well
which I have not updated so uh what I'm
going to do is uh let's see if I can do
that right
now all right so this is rece resolve
yes and no but there is yesterday I
added oh I added that but I did not
refresh it so I need to refresh this
okay so refresh
it
okay all right so perfect so the email
is also right here so now I'm going to
go back to my analysis Tab and then I'm
going to go to structure data and then
I'm going to pick up the email and put
it right here okay and I want the phone
number as well so it didn't phone number
again it was coming as Gibb because Ive
had put message call ID instead of the
call phone number so that was that's the
reason if you go here it is giving you
that uh phone number this kind of weird
thing right so I don't want that what I
want is
uhoh okay what I want is the phone
number so I'm just going to delete this
and then I'm going to pick up this phone
number from here and put it out here so
now I know basically within the and I
say
okay and then just remember to save and
it's all done okay perfect okay so let's
see let's run the system one more time
and then let's see what happens so what
I'm going to do now is I will switch on
both of these agents all right so you
can either switch them from here you can
run once or you can just switch them on
so once you switch them on this is like
running you don't have to see them again
so it will start showing it out
here okay so you can see it out here
flip bites this is on and so I'm just
going to go down and see the flip bites
agent example as well so I'm going to
switch this on as well okay so both of
them are switched on
now okay great so now now this is both
are running right now and this is also
we've already tested this is also
working fine okay so what I want to do
now is that I don't want to actually
call from the platform what it should do
is when somebody calls on the phone to
this number right we'll go into phone
numbers we already have this phone
number I've got connected this okay and
I've bought this phone number from um
trilo as I showed earlier in the video
but I did not connected so let me show
you how to connect this as well to the
assistant so when you go down if you go
into inbound settings inbound phone
number number and this is assistant so
you need to select the assistant and I
will select Fitness Now flip by a agent
okay so you just select that and that's
it that's all you need to do all right
so now the inbound phone number is
this and it is connected to the flip b a
agent so every time somebody calls this
particular phone number what it's going
to do is it is going to start this
particular agent which is a flip bit
agent and then as the call progresses
everything else falls into place so let
me just call this number and then what
we'll do is we will actually see if this
works or not okay so now let's try to
give a call okay I've already connected
the number with uh the assistant as you
saw so now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to actually call this Us number
which is 646 762 and 560 just so you
know basically this is a temporary
number so after this uh particular call
