# Category: n8n-automation

Welcome to the most comprehensive NATO
course where I take you from a real
beginner in AI automation [music] to
someone who's actually able to build
automations and AI agents for themselves
or for other businesses. And in case we
haven't met, my name is Mikuel and over
the past 12 months, we've helped over 40
businesses implement AI and automations
and taught over 20,000 people in the
process. All starting with zero
technical knowledge. So, we're going to
go through everything from understanding
[music] what is AI automation to setting
up your own end to end account,
understanding how to build stronger and
faster, more scalable AI automations and
AI agents, and finally actually building
systems step [music] by step. By the
end, you'll be an AI automations and AI
agents expert and you know exactly how
to build systems that drive real
business value. So, the course itself is
split into six different modules. Module
one is getting started with NAT
foundations. We'll go through exactly
what automation even is to understanding
how you can set up everything within
Nitn and build your first automation.
Module two is [music] core niten
foundations using automation logic and
APIs and walking you through exactly how
automation really works in the back end.
Module three is AI agent fundamentals
and really understanding how AI agents
work. Module four is building smarter AI
systems using frameworks and prompts
which allow our automations and AI
agents to make sure that everything that
we build is actually scalable, tangible
and can actually be implemented into a
business. Module five is real world AI
agent projects end to end builds showing
you exactly different use cases within a
business that you can [music] implement
AI agents and showing you how I build it
step by step. And module six is real
world AI workflow projects end to end
builds [music] where I show you exactly
how we now not only just use AI agents
but use entire workflows to be able to
implement into a business and showing
you how I build different use cases step
by step. By the way, if you want access
to all the resources that we're going to
be talking about in this video, plus
being part of a community of over 3,000
people who are actually building
automations every single day and growing
their own businesses. Check the second
link down below. I'm going to leave all
the timestamps down below in case you
want to skip through some modules or go
to the direct part or even come back to
this video. Uh because I know it's
really long. Um so without further ado,
let's dive in.
All right, before we jump into Nit,
let's talk about what is automation.
Automation is the process of using
technology to do tasks without you.
Whether it's AI agents, whether it's
workflows, whether it's all these stuff,
that's exactly what it is. It's using
softwares to be able to do things
without you. Now, every day we all
perform many regular ad hoc tasks. Ad
hoc just means it is repetitive. Whether
you are a working professional, whether
you are a business owner, whether that's
in sales, marketing, operations,
finance, or business management, we all
have different parts of the business
that we have to do because that's what
drives the business forward. But the
problem is these tasks are repetitive,
so they happen every single time.
They're notori.
They're low value addition. So you do
them but they don't add that much value
into your day and most importantly
they're effort and timeconuming. So you
do them they take a ton of time. You
don't want to do them. They are
repetitive. They're very easy. And so
the solution is automation. Now you
might not be fully conscious of it. But
automation actually plays a big role in
our everyday lives. For example, when we
have a meeting in our school community,
so we have two weekly calls. One is a
weekly huddle, the other one is a bip
coding session. when the meeting is 1
hour away then it sends a notification
over email to my school members or
Netflix when you watch a certain type of
movie then Netflix recognizes that. So
it says hey he watched this movie that
means he must like something else right
and it gives you a recommendation that
is automation because it automates the
process of you having to find a movie
that you like yourself or a coffee
machine and you might be asking yourself
how does a coffee machine even play a
role in this? Well just hear me out.
Whenever a coffee machine finishes
making the coffee then the timer
finishes and lastly chbt right because
when you give a prompt to chbttt then it
gives you the output right now chbt is a
bit different just because it's
non-deterministic so nondeterministic
that means that one series of input so
you can say hey can you do this for me
and it does something else you can say
the exact same thing and it might do it
differently next time right because you
can determine the output that you get
but at the end of the day everything is
automation now I don't know if you
noticed the way that I was actually
explaining these concepts but we
actually use a very simple principle
which is if this then that. So if we
have X then it goes to either A and B.
If it's B it go it goes to either E and
F. If it's A then it goes to either C
and D. And that is exactly how
automation works. Everything and
everything is built on logic right
whether you're building code whether
you're using automations whether you're
using niten make.com zaper power
automate all these tools they're all
built on logic. If this happens or when
this happens then you do this. And the
question then becomes, what can
automation do for you? Well, as a
business owner or an individual, it
increases productivity and efficiency,
which means that you can do more with
less, more leverage. You save time to do
other things, right? Because automation
for a business means that they can now
focus on other areas of the business.
Has an increase of availability because
automation doesn't need holidays. They
don't need any emotional support.
They're always there working 24/7. You
can scale with less resources. And by
the way, we've come to a point where
automation allows us to be able to build
a oneperson company as you might have
heard. Uh but it's all because of the
softwares and technology that is out
there all because of automation. And
it's more robust and less errors.
Especially when it comes to the
repetitive tasks that you have to do
every single time. Because if you are
anything like me, when I do something
over and over again, I get tired and my
quality of output goes down, right? And
so with automation, it's consistent. And
with that said, let's jump into N8N. All
right, so this right here is N8N. Now,
all you have to do to get to this page
is go to nitn.io and you'll have this
dashboard. Now, as you can see here, is
a flexible AI workflow automation for
technical teams that allows us to be
able to build automations without
needing to know how to code. Now, the
automation can vary, right, depending on
what you're using it. IT, security, dev,
sales, you can do a bunch of stuff
within this exact platform. And it
allows us to have so much flexibility
around what we build as well as plugging
it to over 500 integrations, which is a
bit lower than other platforms, but it
still allows us to be able to speak to
different softwares altogether. And
also, it has the ability for us to code
when you need it, the UI when you don't,
which means that you can go either way,
which is why I mentioned that it's
flexible in what we do because it's
great for two kinds of people. All
right. So, if I go to pricing right
here, I can see how much we actually
have to spend to be using any. Now, N10
does not have a free plan on the cloud
version, right? Cloud version. Now, if
you're a beginner to N10, you have
probably heard about self-hosting versus
cloud hosting. Cloud hosting just means
that you just use N10 within the cloud.
Literally just here on Chrome, on
Safari, whatever it is. But we do have
the option to self-host, which means
that we create our own server and we
self-hosted in our own server. So, we
don't have to pay. Now, don't worry. I'm
going to show you exactly how to
self-host as well in the next few
videos. So, you'll have that, too. Now,
for the cloud hosting version, which is
the one that most people use. We don't
have a free plan, uh, but we have a
starter plan, pro, business, and
enterprise. Now, most people use the 24
plan, which is, I believe, about 30
bucks. And the way that Niten actually
prices us is through work for
executions, which I'll speak about in
just a second. But we do have the
ability for us to start a free trial
with no credit card required which
allows us to test any for about 14 days
before we have to upgrade to a paid
plan. And here we have one shared
project, five concurrent executions,
unlimited users, 50 AI workflow build
credits, and forum support, which is
more than enough for what we need. Now,
if you are building Nitan for a bigger
company and you want more workflow
executions, then you're most likely
going to be using the pro plan, which is
€60 a month. Now, honestly, this is not
super cheap, but when you think about
the concept of how they actually price
their automations, it is much better
than any other platform that I've seen
before. And same thing here, but it has
a bit more stuff when it comes to the
actual plan. All right, so for you, just
press start a free trial right here.
Then you can start filling out the form
and then you can press start a free
14-day trial.
Go through the onboarding questionnaire
right here where they ask you a few
questions just so they get to know you a
little bit more. Okay.
podcast submit. And you can also invite
members into your workspace. Let's just
press skip. And now our workspace is
starting up. Now, I do really like the
onboarding um sequence that Enit has. Is
really, really quick and is really,
really easy to follow. Now, because
you're watching this video, there's no
need to press this video right here cuz
I'll show you everything that you have
to know. Uh but it is a pretty good
starting video as well. And this guy is
a legend. [laughter] All right. All
right, once the workspace is ready, just
press start automating, which will take
you to a dashboard that looks like this.
So, welcome to Nintend. Now, on the top,
you get to see that you have 14 days
left of your free trial, and you have
a,000 executions, which is again the way
that N10 charges you. And then on the
top, you have upgrade now, which is a
button to upgrade. I'm going to press X,
and now we have this page. All right, so
on the top right here, we have a
dashboard that allows us to visualize
the numbers. So, I can actually press
inside each one and be able to see the
different graphs. Now, production
executions just mean that hey, how many
executions? So, how many times did our
automation run every single uh 7 days?
How many times did the automation run
but it didn't work? Then out of all the
executions that didn't run in the past 7
days, how many of them did not work,
which is this percentage right here. And
then how much time did you save or how
much time did the workspace save with
these automations in place which is good
to have but at the same time it isn't
super accurate because to understand how
much time you saved for a company or for
yourself any needs to know how much time
did you take in the first place to do it
right because then you're saving them
that much time and lastly runtime. So
for how long are the automation running
now right here and on the top as well
you have the ability to create a
workflow and this is how you start from
scratch. This is how you start building.
Now before we get to that we have
workflows here. Then we have credentials
right here, which is the ability for us
to be able to add credentials for the
different software APIs. Now, if you
have no clue what APIs are, it's how
automations are basically happening, how
they're existent. I'm going to go
through APIs in much more detail in the
later stages of the video, so don't
worry. But here, we're basically adding
the username and password for each
software. So, we always have it here. We
don't have to re-upload it again. It's
always a repository of passwords. Then,
we have executions. So we can see all
the executions which is hey this
automation just ran it logs it so you
have everything logged and uh secured
here which is great. And lastly it's
data tables. Now I'm going to dive into
data tables in this module I believe or
next module um where I show you exactly
how you can use data tables how they're
powerful how they're better than using
tools like Google Sheets or Air Table or
Notion. So we'll dive into that. Now
without further ado let's press start
from scratch or you can press create a
workflow. All right. And once you get to
this dashboard you'll be introduced with
two different options. The first one is
adding a first step which is adding a
first step manually right here trigger
which is the first step of the actual
workflow automation or you can start
using build with AI. Now build with AI
is only something that depending on when
you're watching this video it only came
out about a month ago. But when I press
this button right here it takes me to
this right page right here. Now the good
thing about any is that it has two
different types of support. It has the
support where you can ask any questions
about anything and you can simply type
any message here and it will give you an
answer sort of like an annot coach that
helps you when you're building your AI
agents or automations. And then we have
the feature which is build. Now build
again is something that recently came
out but it allows us to actually give it
a prompt. So we can tell it hey what
would you like to automate? And it
actually builds a thing. I'm going to
just do this real quick so you get to
see exactly how it looks. I'm going to
say AI agent that drops my emails and we
have only 20 credits a month to use. I
want to press go. As you can see now,
this is thinking it's searching through
the nodes. I'll explain exactly what a
node is. Essentially is a step in an
automation. It's getting the node
details. So, it's understanding exactly
automations in any understanding which
steps to put together and what. On the
left hand side, you get to see that this
is working. Now, you get to see that
it's adding the different steps of the
automation. And the best way to describe
this is that it's searching through a
puzzle. It's understanding exactly what
pieces do I need for the puzzle and then
it's getting the pieces and then it's
putting the pieces together right here
and then it's connecting making
connections inside those pieces which we
have right here. And now we can start
using the automation. Now I'm going to
delete this and start from scratch
because I want to show you exactly what
it looks like without the build with AI.
As you can see now we have no option to
build with AI. We just have the first
step. So when I press this I can see
that on the right hand side it asks us
what triggers this workflow. Now a
trigger like I mentioned before is the
first thing that starts the automation.
Now in N10 we have the ability to
trigger manually. So we can manually
trigger this. We just press this button
right here which is execute workflow
which means that we're starting the
automation and it executes manually.
We're able to trigger from an app event.
So something happens within any of these
apps we can get notified and then it
starts the automation. And there's about
500 apps here. a bit lower than other
platforms but N10 is constantly adding
it here which is great. We have on a
schedule. This is in case you want to
start your automations maybe once a day
or you want to run it once a week or
every other Tuesday on a July. You can
do this. You can do on web hook call.
Now a web hook is something that I'm
going to explain in a later stage of the
video but it's something that we use
when we want to get notified when
something happens. We have on form
submission which is for us to be able to
use forms inside of any end so that when
someone submits the form it then sends
us the information inside the form and
then we can start the automation. Then
we can do when executed by another
workflow. So we can actually have a
workflow that calls another automation
right. So workflow calls another
workflow and then brings the data back.
Then we have on chat message in case we
want to create a chatbot within any then
we have when running evaluation. So this
is in case you want to test the
performance of your workflow or of your
AI agent and then you can do other ways
as well which in this case it's using
other different service. Now I will
cover this in the later stages of the
video but understand that a trigger is
just the first step of the automation
because let's say we do it manually. Now
we have the ability to then add the next
steps. And so when we have the first
step here the way that this works is
that we have this connected to another
step right here and I can choose the
next step. In this case we have the
ability to use AI in our workflows. We
have the ability to use any
applications, so any softwares, the
ability to transform any data right
here. The ability for us to have some
sort of routting, which means that if we
send the automation one way, if this
happens, the other way if something
happens and again all these things might
look complex because you're new to Nit,
but trust me, they're much easier when
you actually put them into practice. We
have core which is using code HTTP web
hooks a bunch of stuff that you
shouldn't worry about now and human in
the loop which is another feature that
I'll be explaining. So we have the first
step then we have the next step. So
let's say I want to talk to notion or
Google sheets. Let's say Google sheets.
Now we are introduced with Google sheets
and these are all the actions that we
can do within that software. Right? So
with every software that we have, let's
say even Gmail, if I press on the actual
software, I can see all the actions that
I can do within that software. I can add
a label to message, delete a message,
get a message, get many messages. I can
do a bunch of stuff within each
software, which is where automation
truly shines because it does the things
that we don't want to do or that we
don't have to do. And so let's say I
wanted to go back to Google Sheets. I
can just press Google Sheets here.
Action and app, which you find again
right here, action and app. So in I can
go Google Sheets I can choose the action
that we want to take which is append the
row and now we're introduced to this
page right here now every node has an
input then has in the middle the
configuration which is how do we
actually set the thing up and then the
output which is okay using the
configuration here what was the output
all right so I just made a Google sheet
here that has name email phone number
company row and address let me name this
contacts now here if I go back to any
the first step to building any kind of
automation with different steps in the
flow is connecting our accounts to these
softwares. So we're able to access them
without us having to go to the actual
software to do it. So right here you get
to see on the top that we have
credential to connect with which is just
press here. You can create a new
credential which means that you're
connecting your account and you're
introduced to this page. Now if you see
ooth 2 service accounts allowed HTTP and
you get overwhelmed don't worry just
sign in with Google. It's just a simple
login verification and you're all good.
I'm going to press the account that I
want to connect to. You can press select
all. So you're basically saying, hey, I
trust Nitn to have access to my Google
Drive and my Google Sheets. You will get
to this page which is connection
successful. And you'll be redirected
here to Niten. I can make a name. So I
can say Mikuel
system
account.
So on press save. And usually what we
have is also the date. And the reason
why we add the name is because when you
connect 20 to 30 accounts here, you want
to know exactly what the account was.
And so the only way for us to know
exactly what the connection is is to
name the actual connection. Once you
have this here, now the resource is
usually what is the thing that we're
manipulating. What is the thing that
we're taking and doing something with?
In this case, it will be a Google sheet.
The operation is always the action that
we're taking. So as you can see here,
you have different options. We have
create, delete, delete rows, get rows,
update a row. You can do a bunch of
stuff and in this case you have append a
row which is create a new row in a sheet
right here. The document is choosing the
actual Google sheet which in this case
is contacts right here. See how I just
here and also what you could do is
actually go to the ID or the URL of the
Google sheet which I can find if I go
here I can find in the URL here and the
ID is usually right here and then the
sheet which is a sheet within the Google
sheet which in this case is sheet one.
That's a lot of sheet right there. Um,
and finally, you have this right here.
And so, this is where you start to map
columns. So, again, what we're doing
here is we're adding a row inside here.
So, we're adding a row into name, email,
phone number, company name, role, and
address. Which is why when I go back
here, I can see that it's asking us,
hey, what are the different values that
you want to send? In this case, for
name, let's just put James Arthur. Let's
do email. My email here, my phone
number, my company, the role,
and the address, so on. And now leave
everything else as is. These are just
other options that you can um sort of
play around with, but there's no need
for that. And all we have to do now to
actually run the automation is to be
able to connect this to here. So this is
saying, hey, the first step now is
connect it to the next step. And so if I
press here execute workflow, this should
now start the automation and do the
action append the row like we mentioned
and adding these details in a new row.
So let's try it out. Let's say I go to
execute workflow. I can see that the
first step executed. And we know this
because it was all green check mark. And
the second step as well. And if I go to
my Google sheet, I can see now that
James Arthur with his email, phone
number, gem solutions, CEO in Spain was
added to our database. And that right
there was a full execution from the
start until the end. Workflow executions
from the first step until the last step.
Now we can add another step which let's
say is Gmail. So I just type Gmail. I
can choose a software here. And now I
can choose the action. So in this case
it can be send a message. And now we're
introduced to this page right here which
is very very similar to the one that we
had on Google Sheets. But the only
difference now is that we have access to
the previous we call them variables
right because there are different
variables here. And now we can use these
variables in the automation. And that's
why we don't call them variables but we
call them dynamic variables because they
change every single time. Because when I
put name somewhere here and I run the
automation again later if the name
changes this automatically changes the
name. So all I have to do here is do the
same thing. So I can send a message
which in this case is send an email. I
can sign in with Google. I can choose my
account. Select all. Connection
successful. And now [snorts] I can name
this. Press save. X. And now we have
connected our account to any. So now N10
is able to use our Gmail. The resource
which is what is the thing that we're
manipulating again changing is a message
which in this case is an email. And you
can use draft thread label. You can do
whatever. Operation which is what is the
action that we're taking. In this case,
it's sending, but we can do a bunch more
stuff here depending on what you want to
do. And then it's asking us who do we
want to send the email to? What is the
subject line of the email and what is
the message of the email, which is the
email body. So now, as you can see here,
when I pressed on two, it gave me the
ability to drag an input field from the
left to use it here. So now I can take
the field from the previous step, drag
this across over here, email, and have
this be the variable that we use every
single time instead of putting the email
here, right? Instead of putting the
email manually cut
to5gmail.com,
because if you do it this way, it's
going to be fixed. But if you take the
variable from the previous step and I
drag this across here, then only are we
able to change the variable dynamically
without us having to go here and change
it manually ourselves. And so what we're
doing now is that we've just pulled in
the variable here. We can do name. So
pull this name here and say welcome to
the team. And also one more thing that
you start to see is JSON code. Right
now, this looks very intimidating for
someone looking to get started with
automations and going into Nitn. But
trust me, it's actually quite easy
because this code right here is
literally just the variable here that we
just pulled across. So, you don't really
have to know exactly what this is. But
in case you're wondering, we can
actually hardcode it. So, we can do
curly bracket curly bracket. This opens
this up. You can do JSON dot the actual
step from the previous step. So, you can
go to let's say email. And when you
press email, it automatically takes us
back in the same place as if I were just
to drag this across.
And this is great for us in case we want
to reference any variables from the
previous steps. And there's a ton of
variables and we just want to reference
them really really quickly. We just
manually hardcode it. But most of the
times you're just going to drag and
drop. And then we're going to ask the
email type. So in this case, let's just
do text. HTML is just the way that you
make your emails look pretty. We can say
hey brother happy to work with and let's
do company right here. So now we're
saying hey brother [snorts] happy to
work with JSON variable which is company
which is this name right here. We just
don't see JM solutions because it's a
variable right here. Now the good thing
about N10 is that we can actually see
the output. So we can see the actual
variable before we run it which is
amazing because now this gives us the
ability to visualize whether it's
correct or not. So, James Arthur,
welcome to the team. Hey, brother. Happy
to work with JM Solutions, which is
great. Now, what I can do is go back. I
can go back here. I can change the
email. So, let's say
this one here that I have, make
dollar5@gmail.com.
And now, all I have to do is execute the
workflow again from the start until the
end
right here. This now goes into Google
Sheets and goes here. I can see now that
I have the name, the email, and I guess
the email changed, right? because we
changed them manually in N10. The phone
number JM solutions CEO in Spain. And as
I showed you, it also sent the email. So
if I go to my email here, I can see that
we had a new email called James Arthur,
welcome to the team. Hey brother, happy
to work with JM Solutions, which is the
exact same email that we added into our
Nintend. And so now that we built this,
I can explain exactly how the pricing
works. So from the start until the end,
right? When you are testing. So when
we're pressing this button and we are
executing this, we're not paying for it
from the time that we want to set this
live. So we don't have to manually do it
every single time. We can turn this on
by pressing this button. So right now
the workflow or the actual automation is
inactive, which means that the
automation is only running when we
manually run it. When we go inside the
platform, when we manually press this
button and it goes here. But in the case
for clients that you want to set this
live, it's sort of like this is just for
testing. When you're building
automations, you're testing here and
there. And the lives when you want to
actually set this live, it goes live.
Now it works by itself and it runs
through this at whatever interval you
want. And the good thing about this is
that we're not paying for it when we're
testing, which is great because it
allows us to be able to spam the testing
as much as we we can because the way
that they actually charge you is by word
for executions, which is from here to
here. As you can see, we have the green
check marks which tell us that
everything went good, which is awesome.
Now, let's say something went wrong,
right? So, if I go here and I just
create a new credential and I just save
it. So, I just put a fake credential.
Close Gmail account. This shouldn't
work. So, now if I execute the workflow,
I can also execute it here instead of
going here. I can see that now in the
bottom, you can't see it because my face
is there. But if I just move myself
here, I can see that I have problem in
node here, right? Which allows us to see
that we have a problem in our
automation. And so this node right here,
again, a node is just a square within
any is a step in our automation. We can
see that we have an issue. And it tells
us the actual issue unable to sign in
without access token, which means that
the authorization, the actual account
was invalid. And on the right hand side,
you can also see if something went
wrong, what is it that went wrong? And
you can also ask AI, which is amazing
because this AI is actually good. It's
not some sloppy thing that they just
added into the software. It actually
works and it's pretty good. With that
said, make sure that when you build
automations, you always save right here
on the top. And up here, you have the
ability to edit. So, this is where we
edit our workflows. Executions is where
we get to see all the times that this
executed that this ran, right? The first
time it ran, the second time when we had
more steps, the third time when we had
even more steps, right? So we get to see
exactly the previous times that are run.
And then we have evaluations in case
you're running some more advanced
evaluations. You're testing your your
actual workflow. If you're building this
for clients, you're most likely going to
use this, but it is not necessary to
start. Going back to editor right here
on the top right here, I have the
ability for me to duplicate the actual
workflow. So if I duplicate this, I have
to rename this. And I can press
duplicate. And this will now make the
exact same workflow here. And then I
have the ability to download. So if I
download it now, I get a JSON file. And
so the good thing about that is that
this in the back end is all JSON, which
is is all code. And so I can simply just
press download like I showed you. And
then you can press import from file,
which allows you to import the
automation into your own workspace. So
if I go to a blank workflow, I can
simply press this button right here. I
can import from file. And now I can put
the actual file that I need. And
suddenly I have the actual automation
which is imported into your my own
account. And then finally, we have
change the owner. So you can change the
owner of the actual automation. You can
rename the automation like this right
here. And you can import from URL. So in
case you turn the file into a URL, you
can simply import it there. On the right
hand side here, like we mentioned, we
have the ability for us to add steps. We
have the research. So we can command
bars. We can actually search through the
different notes that we have here. We
have notes, which is a big part of
Beniten because we can actually start
documenting our automations. So I can go
in here and I can say first step is
manual and I can delete all this and I
can put this over the automation which
is great because when I want to give the
automation to someone right I can
actually give them an explanation of
exactly how it's working. If I go here I
can also say this step allows us to be
able to manually trigger the automation.
Right? And so we have the text here and
you can start to see how bigger
automations and bigger workflows use
this and it's something that I use all
the time when I have to give workflows
in AI agents to my community members who
are looking to get them and then start
using them right away and now they have
an explanation of what it is. Then we
have right here focus panel in case
you're doing some note stuff here. We
don't really use this that much so don't
worry. Uh and finally we have AI which I
mentioned is able to build the actual
workflow. Let me turn this off. Which is
able to build the actual workflow for us
or is able to assist us whenever we have
any questions about automations. Now,
you probably might be asking yourself
this question, right? Which is if we can
build with AI, why are we learning this
at all? It's because AI only gets you so
far. When something doesn't work, how do
you know if it doesn't work? How do you
know if it's not good enough? How do you
know if it's not efficient? Which is
where understanding the fundamentals is
very, very important rather than relying
on AI for everything. All right. So now
that you understand exactly what
automation is, how you can set up your
own niten account, howen actually looks
visually, plus building your first
automation inside of niten. Now it's
time to go a level deeper because in the
next module we'll dive into actually
understanding how automations really
work. We'll dive into APIs, web hooks,
and how data flows within automations.
We will look at credentials. We will
look at transforming data and also
understanding error handling. So if
something goes wrong, what do we do
about it? And lastly, understanding the
core 17 notes that you need to know when
you want to master N10. So by the end of
this section, you'll not only use any
10, but you'll actually understand it.
If I had to learn just one skill for AI
automation, it would be understanding
how APIs work because fundamentally they
are the things that allow softwares to
speak with other softwares. And so once
you understand really understand how
APIs work, you'll be able to use nitend
zapermake.com Power Automate all with no
problems without getting stuck and
without any limitations. And the problem
is most people skip this. They go
straight to the platforms to build
automation step by step. And when
something breaks, they have no clue why.
So in this video, I'm going to break
down exactly how APIs actually work, how
to read an API documentation without
freaking out, and how to build your
first real API request inside of Venet.
Let's dive in. All right. So, API stands
for application programming interface.
[music] Very fancy term that nobody even
knows the meaning to. Uh, but what it
means is the ability for softwares to
speak with other softwares. Now, think
of a waiter in a restaurant, right? This
waiter has the chef and he has the
customers. And between the chef and the
customers, there's a series of actions
that happen, right? So, take the order,
bring the order from the kitchen, they
deliver the order, make the order.
There's a whole repetitive loop that
happens over and over again. And so that
is the exact same when it comes to APIs
for softwares where we have one software
here, one software here and these two
softwares communicate to each other
through a series of requests and
responses. So request in this case would
be to make the order. The response would
be the actual order being delivered to
their table. And that is the exact same
when it comes to the softwares. And so
fundamentally the waiter in this case is
the API and the chef is one software and
the customers are other softwares. And
this right here is the thing that allows
the softwares in make.com and it end to
speak to each other to be able to have a
sequential order. So we send data to a
place and get something back. And that's
how automations and AI agents are built.
Now what can APIs do with software?
There's a few things that APIs can do.
We call them requests. So requests are
just a way for the server, the API
server to send information to the actual
software itself to then create an
action. Now the first thing it can do is
post. So this is when any type of new
record is created in a software. So this
is like making a Google sheet row. It's
creating a contact on ClickUp, a contact
in Hopspot, it's um you know sending
information to OpenAI to make a LinkedIn
post. This is a post request which is
sending information from one place to
another. Then we have get. So get is
extracting any details from any record
from the software. So let's say someone
filled out a form on your website. You
wanted to get the information from that
form and then use it for whatever you
want. Right now you're getting
information because the information is
going from somewhere else to us. That's
getting information. Then we have putter
patch which is updating records uh in a
software. So let's say John's name is
not John anymore. it's James then you
use a put a patch request right so
updating information and then we have
deleting so you can't see this fully but
it's deleting a record from a software
so let's say we had a Google sheet or
maybe a contact we just want to delete
the row or delete the Google sheet or we
just wanted to delete the contact that
is a delete request so again post is to
send information get is to get
information then putter patch is to
update information and then delete is to
delete information from somewhere now
I'll share a story here so I was on a
call with a client a while back and she
asked to automate different parts of her
onboarding process. And she used Zoho
CRM as the CRM, which by the way is just
a place for companies to store
information uh to be able to send
information to Zoho to make a new
contact whenever someone filled out a
form. Now, the problem is I had never
used Zoho CRM. So, I had never used it.
I didn't know exactly what you can and
cannot automate with Zoho CRM, which is
why we get to the next part, which is
finding the information of what you can
automate and cannot automate within a
software. So all I did is a simple
Google search and I searched up the
software name. So in this case it can be
Zoho CRM Monday, it can be openi, it can
be whatever it is API documentation. And
this is where we get to the fundamental
concept of an API documentation which
allows us to be able to see exactly what
you can automate within a software and
how to set everything up. Now here's an
example of an API documentation. This is
Apollo's API documentation. And at first
you think this is way too complex. But
the reality is if you understand how
this looks, all the others will be very
very easy because they all follow a very
similar structure. So the way that an
API documentation works is that on the
left hand side right here, you get to
see all the types of requests. So this
is enriching people, it's searching
people, searching organizations,
creating an account. There's different
things that you can do within Apollo's
API, which means automatically without
having to go to Apollo, right? And so
each action right here, so each thing
that we can do has a corresponding type
of request that follows [music] through.
So people enrichment in this case would
be a post request because we are sending
information to the server and then it's
enriching the person. Then we have let's
say organization enrichment which is a
get request or update account which is a
put request right so we have different
types of request and different actions
that we can do using Apollo
automatically within our automations and
the only way to know is actually just
looking here. Now let's say we go to
people enrichment. So this will now look
at what you can do within that specific
request which in this case is enriching
people. And this request right here has
the type of request and then has a URL.
Now the URL is something that is very
very important in our API requests
because they are the thing that allows
us to be able to send the information
the right way. It's sort of like going
to google.com, right? The server knows
that you want to go to google.com
because because of the request, because
of the URL. And so this is the exact
same because this allows the server to
know, hey, he wants to use Apollo and he
wants to enrich people. Then in the
middle here, it gives us a summary as to
what it is, how it works and so on. So
these down here are basically saying,
hey, this is the type of request. So
right here, this is the information you
have to send to the server to call the
request to make it happen. In this case,
it's enriching people and you have to
send the first name and the last name,
right? And those are the details that
you have to look into understanding
exactly what to send to the server. And
on the right hand side, you get to see
the um the actual setup. So how can we
set this up in our automation platforms?
And quick side note, the reason why we
look at the API documentation is because
here if I go to Apollo, I can't find it.
Which means that now we have to set up
the API request using the documentation.
And so the left hand side is the type of
request. The middle is to show you the
exact request and sort of to give you a
summary of what it is and what it looks
like. In the right hand side is saying,
okay, we have the request, we have the
summary. Here's how you can set it up.
Now, the main thing that we have to look
at when we have to set up an API request
through an API documentation is the
curl. Now, the curl is the thing right
here that you see which basically gives
us a heads up or an understanding of how
the request actually works. And if I go
to any time right here and I go to HTTP
request, which is the thing that we use
to make the actual request, we can see
that we have a button right here, which
is import curl. And this will be the
place where we import the curl, which is
the one that we saw on the API
documentation. And then this basically
makes the whole request for us, which
I'll show you in just a second. Now,
this will make much more sense once we
actually build the API request, which is
super damn easy. So, don't worry. Uh,
we'll go through it step by step. But
now you got to see what a structure of
an API documentation looks like. And
this is for a software called Apollo.
Now if I go to the second API
documentation, this right here is for a
software called Instantly, which is a
cold email software. As you can see, it
follows the exact same structure. On the
left hand side, we get to see all the
actions that we can take. On the middle,
it tells us this is the summary or this
is what it is. And these are the
different variables that we have to send
to the server in order to make the
action happen. And on the right hand
side, this is the way that we set it up
through a curl, which is in code, right?
But again, we don't have to know how to
code. It's just telling us the way that
we have to set things up. And usually
the curl in this case has a URL, which
is the action that we're taking, telling
the server, hey, we want to enrich
leads. We want to send this information
somewhere else. And then we have the
headers, which usually are a way for the
actual server to authorize that this is
your account. And the way it does that
is through something called an API key,
which we use for tons of things. OpenAI
API key. We use claw API keys.
Perplexity API keys. It's just sort of a
way for the server to know like a
password to say, hey, this key is only
for me for my account. So you can take
action on my account and you know it's
my account if it's this key. And then we
have content type application.json.
Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's
not. It's just a way for us to tell it
to format the information in the right
way. And then D, which is the body,
which are these parameters. So these
variables which we sent through to the
actual server to make things happen. And
if that confused you even more then just
wait until we build the API request cuz
it will be very very easy. And then the
last API documentation will be ClickUp.
As you can see I'm just showing you the
example. So you get to see the
reoccurrence in the structure of an API
documentation which is the one right
here. On the left hand side we have the
types of requests. In the middle we have
the summary, the URL, the type of
request which is post uh the title and
then here will be the parameters that we
have to send through to the server to
say hey here's what you have to do
here's how to do it and so on and on the
right hand side this is the way that we
set it up which is the exact same and as
you can see the thing that we really
care about is the curl request because
this is the right hand side part of
these API documentations which allow us
to be able to know exactly how we set
things up and if you read API docu
documentations. A lot of the times or
most of the times you will see something
that looks like these. These are three
random API documentations and they all
follow the same exact structure. So
let's set up the API request. Uh let me
give you a use case. Let's say we want
to get the weather of a country or a
location. Right? If you go here to
weather, we can do the open weather map.
But there's actually this other software
which is called the weather API. So if I
go here to weather API,
there's this software right here, free
weather API, which isn't listed here,
right? And this is when we start using
the HTTP request. Okay, so HTTP request
again like I mentioned before is on the
case where we can find the exact
software for the specific action that
we're taking. So we actually make our
sort of custom API call which is saying,
hey, even though we might not have an
end, it doesn't mean it's impossible,
right? we can still make the actual
request which is where the HTTP request
comes in. So all I have to do is go here
put HTTP
and then we get to this page. The first
thing is the type of request whether
it's a get, delete, head, options, pat,
post, put, which we went through just
now and we have options head which I
have never used so probably not
something that you should know about. Uh
then we have the URL which is the action
that we're taking uh which we get from
the API documentation. Then we have the
authentication which we'll go through in
just a second. And then we have the
parameters which I mentioned will be
here. And then also the body which is
this right here right or you can also
use JSON uh which we get from the API
documentation. Now we'll have to set one
up so you understand. And let's go to
the free weatherapi.com. We get here and
now I'm saying hey I don't have it
within any so I really have to go to the
docs. And usually you find this here. So
docs. All right. So this right here is
the API documentation. And so all we
have to go is to the request, right? So
we have the getting started, we have the
authentication, we have the request URL,
we have a bunch of things, but the thing
that we really care about is the bulk
request, which is the request, which
will be up down here, I believe. Yeah,
down here, which will be the request
that we will use as an example for the
actual uh API request that we do within
N10. So all we have to do is copy this,
go here and set up an HTTP request,
import curl, just paste it here. Now we
can see that everything was done for us.
We have the post, we have the URL, we
have the fields, the key, the Q, which
in this case would be um we can see here
we can see that we can do the city name,
we can do the US zip code, UK postcode
and so on. Um which is required. And
then we have the API key which is the
one right here which is sort of a
password that says hey this is my
account this is um related to me just
use mine and the body in this case we
actually don't need this because this is
just an example
so I can delete this and we can just
work with this. So type a request which
is post URL which is the URL that we do.
So what is the action that we're taking
and then we have the key which is the
API key which we find on my account. So
when you make a free account, you can go
here to the dashboard and up here you
will copy the API key and paste it back
here and then the Q will be the city
name. So we can do London or whatever it
is and I press execute step which will
now execute the step. So as you can see
here it successfully uh ran this and I
get the weather. So the current weather,
the temperature of that specific place
which we can then use for whatever it
is. Right? All right. So now you got to
see exactly what it's like to build an
API request, an API call, uh, which
[music] we call and this is exactly what
you can then use in between your
automation steps. So let's say we had a
next node which would be let's do an
edit fields and we wanted to get the
temperature.
So temp temperature
in Celsius 9.3. Yeah, thank god I'm not
in London. uh I can execute the step and
this will now call the server bring the
data back and then here you can see that
the temperature was 9.3 because this is
a variable that we found here but again
the reason why we using HTTP is because
if I go here to free weather API it's
not listed here it's not here right and
any only has about 4 to 500 it has the
main softwares but sometimes softwares
that we want here are not here which is
exactly why we have to then go to the
API documentation and find or understand
how we can set up the API request test.
In this video, I'm going to show you how
you can master and attend just by
learning 17 notes. And these are the
exact same ones that we use pretty much
80% of the time when building
automations for clients. And honestly,
these are probably the only ones that
you'll ever need. So, the first one is
the trigger. Now, the trigger is
essentially the first step of the
automation. Like, what is that thing
that starts the automation for us to
then do the next steps? In any we have
different types of triggers. Uh, the
first one is a manual trigger. So we can
just execute the workflow manually. Now
this right here is something that we use
most of the times just for testing,
[music]
right? Because we want to test
something. So there has to be a first
step and that's where we add a manual
trigger. Now the second one is a
schedule trigger. So this trigger right
here is primarily used when you want to
run the automation let's say once a
week, once a month or at certain
interval of time. So if I go in here, I
can see that I can run it um in seconds,
minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and
even custom. So this is cron which you
can put your maybe every 2 p.m. on a
Tuesday or every 3 p.m. on a Friday of
every month and you have different
settings that you can put so that you're
able to um to run the automation at a
very specific time of the month of the
year of the week of the day right so to
give you a use case let's say we had a
content system let's say we wanted to
generate content automatically every
single day what we would do here is we
would go to trigger interval which is
days 1 midnight [music] and trigger
minute zero and this is where we put
this as the first step of the automation
so that it runs every one day at
midnight of the week right so we're able
to run the autom information without us
having to manually trigger it. And this
is for the time trigger. And then we
have the type form trigger. Now, this is
just to show you an example of a trigger
that is not native to N10. These two are
native to N10, which means that N10 owns
those nodes. But in this case, type form
is not any. It's a different platform.
And so, Type Form itself is a platform
that generates forms. So, we can
generate forms. And this trigger right
here starts whenever someone fills out
the hiring form in this case. So I have
the form pulled out here which is a form
that is connected to this type from
trigger and what happens is that
whenever someone fills out the form this
sends a signal to this node because it's
an onapp trigger. Uh that will allow us
to then be notified and start the
automation. So I'm going to press exit
workflow. As you can see now this is
waiting for you to create an event in
type form which is waiting for me to
fill out the form. I'm going to press
submit and as you can see here this is
now triggered and we got the data the
name the email the phone number and
location as well. Right? So this
essentially is an on-app trigger which
means that it triggers whenever an
single app starts something or whenever
something happens within an app that we
can all find right here. Add another
trigger. We have all these triggers and
the on app event is the one that you can
use for whatever it is. So these are all
different softwares that can be the
first step of the automation that
triggers whenever something happens
within that software. Now the next part
of the nodes are going to be storage
solutions. Now, storage solutions is
just a fancy way to say we use nodes
that allow us to store information in
them, right? And so, typically we use
Google Sheets, we can use Air Table, we
can use notion, we can use any new
native data tables which only came out a
few days ago in order to store
information. This could be a simple
Google sheet that looks like this, which
has full name, email address, location,
and phone. But could also mean a data
table within N10, which has name, email,
phone number, and location, which is the
exact same. The only difference is that
one is stored in Nitn and the other one
is stored in Google Sheets. So let me
show you exactly what I mean here. Let
me put the um manual execution here and
I can see that inside I am adding a row.
So append row means I'm adding a row in
the N10 17 nodes which is the name of
the Google sheet right here and I'm
putting the first name or the full name
as Melatory the email is this and the
location is this. I can press execute
workflow which will now run the step
right here and it will add the row into
the Google sheet which will be mik email
and uh location as well and I can also
add the phone which you can also add by
refreshing and let me add let's do 1 555
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and if I execute the step
again I can now see that I will have a
new row that will be added here with
email location and this as well. Now the
reason why it gave us an error is
because Google sheet doesn't like when
you put plus signs or equal signs and so
on because these are native equations
within Google Sheets. Uh but you get the
gist here. You just store information
into Google sheet. The second one is
within the Nitn data tables. So let me
connect this. And in this case we do the
exact same thing. It will be new people
because that is the name of the
database. And we're adding the first
name or the name as Mikell authority my
email my phone number and location as
well. And if I press execute step, I can
see that now it was successful. And if I
go here and I refresh, I can now see
that the data was added here. Full name,
email, phone number, and location as
well. Now, the amazing thing is that
once you master Google Sheets and
Nintend's native data tables, you can
pretty much use Air Table, you can use
notion, you can use Asana, ClickUp, all
these places where you store
information, they're all very, very
similar, right? So, if you understand
one, the setup will be very, very
similar for the other ones. All right?
So now we get to the universal data
processing. So here is where we
manipulate data, right? Manipulate data
just means that we take some sort of
data that comes in and then we structure
it in a way where it makes sense for us
to structure it in. Now in this case I
want to take the um manual execution
here. I'm going to attach it here.
And I can see that inside the edit node
if I execute the step I can see that I
have an array which is basically a list
of people's uh information. So we have
name, email, phone number and location.
David Smith, David Smith, Emily Chan,
Carlos Ramirez, and Asia Khan. And these
are basically giving me the different
pieces of information. Now, the only
problem with this is that let's say we
want to add this to our Google sheet. We
can't because this is an array, which
means that it's inside this right here.
So, this is where the split out comes
in. So, what this means is that if you
want to process each name individually,
right? If you want to process this right
here individually, then this right here,
then this right here, and this right
here, and this right here as well, then
we have to split them out. We have to
take them, as you can see by the diagram
here, it's taking them, which is a
singular thing, and then it's splitting
them out based on the amount of items
that are in the array. So, let me just
show you. Let me just run this right
here. And let me show you that now we
have five items. So, as you can see
here, it went from one item, which is
the array, to five items. And so what
we're doing here is we're processing
each person's details individually
through the automation in the next
steps. And this is splitting out. So
this is when you have an array and you
want to split out each item of that
array. Now aggregate right here is the
exact opposite. As you can see the
diagrams are opposites. And so what we
do here is just bring it back to the way
it was before. Right? And if I press
execute step, I can see that now I have
the array that is back there which is
one item. So you can see we have one
item, five items and one item as well.
Now, typically you would use split out
whenever you have because a lot of the
times we get data all within the same
array. We get a bunch of details,
contacts and so on all within one
singular item. And so what we want to do
is go inside that item and take them out
of each one and process them
individually in case you want to add
them individually to let's say a native
data table or even a Google sheet,
right? You have to process each one
individually for it to actually make
sense to add them to a database or
whatever it is that you want to do.
Whilst this node right here basically
when we have a lot of information that
is a lot of items and we want to put
them all together smash them all
together to then send them through to
the next steps right so it's aggregating
data so it's not everywhere it's not in
different places it's all within one
place then we get on to the logic which
is if so this is saying if this equals
to this then it's true if not it's false
so if I say in this case let me just uh
take this out there we go right here so
let me say if the name contains
um contains Sarah
which should only be one name then we
send it through the true route right so
if I go here I can now see that only one
went through here and the other ones
went through here now this is great
because automation again is logic so if
you want to send the automation in
different ways based on whether
something is true or false then you can
use the if node right here now the
switch node is a bit different because
it gives you more flexibility right let
me I show you exactly what I mean. Let
me say right here inside I have options
to basically route the automation. So I
can say if the name equals to Sarah
Johnson if the name equals David Smith
then we can rename the output to Sarah
rename the output to David. And what
this will do is that it will run through
every single one and the ones that are
Sarah or Sarah Smith in this case. Sarah
Smith, Sarah Johnson, it will send them
through Sarah. And if it's David Smith,
then it will send them through David. So
if I run this, I can see that we only
have one item and one item here because
those are the only ones that applied to
the logic. And so how is this different
from if? Well, if only gives you the
opportunity to add conditions, but don't
add more than true or false options.
While here, you can put as many options
as you want. And this is great because
you could have a use case where you have
emails. You categorize the emails based
on whether they're FAQ, whether they are
uh promotional, whether they are just
normal, whether they are something else.
And an AI categorizes it. And then you
can use a switch node to then say if the
email is FAQ, then you send it this way.
If it's something else, then you send it
this way. If it's something else as
well, because you can keep adding root
rules. You can say if this equals to
whatever, just hello. You can rename it
to FAQ. And this will be another option,
right? And you can do as many options as
you want which is amazing because that
allows us to be able to route the
automation based on [music]
the type of input or the output that we
get in the previous step. All right.
Then we have the code node. Now the code
node is amazing uh because it allows us
to be able to do a lot of things at once
and code is one of the things that again
a lot of no code platforms don't have
because in the name no code. Uh but the
fact that Enit added the code option
here made it so much easier for us to be
able to to transform information from
unstructured to structured in the
easiest way possible and it's very very
fast. Yeah. So let's say we have the
array here which is the exact same as we
had before which are just a bunch of
names that are all uh within the same
array and we can process each one
individually. Now what we can do with
the code node using code and by the way
if you're asking how did you write the
code? I just said split out the items
from the array and the array is this.
And then if I run this, I can see that
now really quick it uh split out the
items in five different um separately.
So now we can go through five items
individually. Now this did the same
function as this. So this wouldn't make
a lot of sense. But if you have
something a lot more complex and you
need the data to be transformed in a way
where it would take you seven or eight
different nodes, then you can do it all
within the code node. Now I'm not going
to get into detail about this because
again, we're all here to not write code,
right? Uh, but just know that you have
this option to be able to write code
with Nitn and it makes it a lot easier
to do more complex stuff. You won't
really need them for most of the time,
but just knowing that you have the
option there to use gives us a lot more
flexibility when we're building
automations. And then we have the merge
node. So, let me actually set this up.
All right. So, for the merge node, what
I did is I put two different fields. One
is hello yo and then the other one is
hello ciao. And when I run this
automation, it will run this one first
and then it will run this one. And let's
say I put a wait node here where I can
put two two seconds just for it to wait
two seconds. I can show you that this
right here will run first and then it
will run this one. Right now let's say
that we had an automation where we had
to run this and then we wanted to run
this and then we wanted to go right
without us having to go through here
first and run the whole automation and
then run through here first. Now let's
say that we had an automation that we
start here and it goes two different
ways but then we want to aggregate the
data. We want to send the data in the
same way as two different inputs, input
one and input two to then be able to
take both pieces of information to then
be able to go to the next steps. So
that's exactly what the merge node does.
If I go here, I can see also I can add
more inputs. So if I press four, it
basically uh it can it can intake more
inputs at the same time. In this case, I
can do two. I can execute the step. And
now we can see that we got two items.
One is yo and one is chao. So what it's
doing here it's it's aggregating both of
them together. Now there are other
options as well um to combine to then
SQL query. So we can query different
things or different data points and then
we can also choose a branch. Now
honestly the one they're mostly going to
use is going to be combine and it's
going to be append. Now append in this
case will be output each item
individually and combine is taking these
two and just putting them all in the
same sort of array that you can use for
the next steps. Now, here's a system
that I built that uses the merge nodes,
three different ones. Uh, and the way
that this works is that we have um the
LinkedIn post which is made, the
Facebook post was made, and then we want
to merge them. So, we have the Facebook
post and the LinkedIn post, and then we
have the Twitter post which is made, the
article which is made, and then we're
merging these two together as well to
then finally merge all four things
together. So, we can directly send them
to the Google sheet. And the reason why
we're merging them is because if we run
each one individually, then we would
have to set up a new automation for each
row at a single time to add them to the
Google sheet, which we can actually just
remove by just merging them all together
in the same sort of structured way,
different items to then send them to the
Google sheet. So the next nodes right
here are going to be connectivity and
API. Now API is the most important skill
when it comes to automation. And if you
haven't watched my video about
fundamentals of API, just watch it up
here. Um, but it is the reason why apps
get to talk to other apps, right? It's
the reason why this app right here can
talk to an attent but this app right
here can talk to this one right or we
can just talk to each other um in
different ways. So in this case the
first node that we have to learn is the
HTTP request. Now this is one of the
most powerful nodes in any because when
we go here and I go to action app. So
this is taking an action within a single
app. We can see that we don't have an
infinite amount of nodes, right? Like we
can stop here and then what? What if we
have a software that we want to use but
we can't find it here. What do we do
then? Well, in this case, we use the
HTTP request. So, let's say I wanted to
use the free weather API which gave me
the API of the weather. And if I go here
to NN, I can't see any app that's called
free weather API. So what I have to do
is I have to set up the HTTP request of
the few other API which I can find in
the documentation right here. By the
way, I covered this in a API
fundamentals video. So if this makes no
sense to you, please go watch that video
cuz it will help a lot. Um, but this
right here is the API documentation
which is essentially a documentation
which allows you to see exactly what you
can automate and what you cannot
automate within a software and also how
to set up the automation. And so by
looking at this um documentation here, I
was able to set up the um the automation
of the weather API which looks at the
temperature in London right now. And if
I execute the step, I can see that now
I'm still able to actually run the
automation. I was still able to use the
software without having to use the
software here which are already pre-made
by 10. And you can see here we have the
different outputs. So London, [music]
we have the temperature, degrees in
Celsius, Fahrenheit, and different other
informations as well. Then we have web
hooks right here. Now, web hooks are a
way for us to get notified when
something happens. So, let's say someone
fills out a form. Well, it sends a data
to the web hook. You remember this right
here, the type form trigger. Well,
behind the type form trigger is actually
a web hook which allows us to be able to
get notified when something happens.
Well, in that case, it's whenever the
form is being submitted, it sends a data
to the web hook through an API. Right?
So, right here we have the test URL
which is used for testing and production
URL which is used when the automation is
set to active. And then we have the
different type of HTTP method which
again is very similar to there because
we have post. We have all these options
and these are the same ones that we have
here. And then we have the path which is
just the way that we uh that we name the
URL. And then this right here is a thing
that you would connect to the software
itself to then be able for us to get
notified when something happens within
that software. And respond to web hook
will be the thing that will then respond
back to the server that we got the
information from. Now, to show you
exactly how it works, what I'm going to
do is use a software called Postman API,
which allows us to send example uh test
data to the web hook, right? I'm going
to go in here, copy this. Make sure you
change this to post request. And then
I'm going to paste this here. Make sure
this is the post request as well. And
then the body will be what is the thing
that we're sending the web hook. In this
case, let's just do full name,
my name. Let me run this here. I'm going
to press send. This will now start the
workflow. As you can see here now we
started the workflow and we sent the
full name here which is the body right
and this is how we send information from
one server to another through a web
[music] hook. Now let's say I had this
connected now all I have to do here is I
have to change this to using respond to
web hook node.
And here um what we can do is
we can just respond with workflow as
finished.
And so when I run this,
I send this here, I can see that now we
get the data workflow has finished. Now
this is amazing when we are sending data
to a software or to a web hook in this
case and we want to get something back.
So let's say we send the signup link to
a user in some sort of software, he
signs up, we get something back. Lastly,
it would be the AI integration. So this
is one of the ones that are most uh
commonly used. Um first one is the AI
node. So this is just to create
something with AI. So in this case we
can say create a LinkedIn post
about life and here we have our openi
connected the resource is text the
operation which is the action that we're
taking is good uh the model it can be um
you have a list of models here you can
use GPT4 or latest or you can use
whatever you want and then you have the
prompts right here the prompts there are
three different prompts that you can
write the first one is a system prompt
the system prompt is a prompt that you
tell the AI uh you give it an identity
so you are a helpful intelligent XY XYZ
assistant. Then you have user. So user
is when you tell it to do something. So
your task is to do XYZ. And assistant
[music] is when you give it some
examples. In this case, let's keep it
simple. I'm going to press execute step.
And this will now create a LinkedIn post
about life. And as you can see, sure,
here's a thoughtful and professional
LinkedIn post about life. And then it
gives me a whole LinkedIn post that we
can then use. Now this AI step is used
whenever we want to have some sort of
data or some sort of input sent to AI
just like we would on chat GBT
automatically and then give us the
output for content for any structured
data that you want structured for
anything pretty much that you can think
of AI playing a role in the automation
just as a linear thing for it to do just
that task in specific only that task and
then we have the AI agent if you haven't
watched my AI agent 101 video make sure
to watch it up here uh it explains
exactly how you can build your first AI
agent from scratch using N10. But the AI
agent is the reason probably the reason
why uh N10 blew up so fast is because it
had now the um opportunity for us to use
something that was connected to AI that
could think through or that could
remember the different conversation we
had, but that was also uh hooked up to
different tools. So in this case, if you
scroll down, we can see that we hook it
up to Gmail, we can hook it up to Air
Table, we can hook it up to well, pretty
much anything. uh we have all these
different softwares that we can use to
then be able to connect it to the AI
agent for it to actually take action and
a good thing is that the Gmail tool can
be connected and the air table tool can
be connected and the let's say notion
tool can be connected and you can have
as many connections as you want and this
acts as a personal assistant that allow
us to be able to take action on
different things based on the input that
we give it. So in this case what it
would look like is we would have a
trigger which would be usually it would
be an on chat message which means that
we're chatting with the AI agent itself
and if I open chat I can now see that I
can speak to the actual AI agent
something that you can't do with AI
step. So I can say hello what this will
do is that it will then talk to its AI.
It will remember the conversation and
then bring it back. It's sort of like a
person that we're talking to. And the
good thing is that the person itself has
access to our software which is amazing
because now it can take action on our
behalf based on the input that we give
it. So if we say draft an email it will
then go to the Gmail tool and then do
its thing. Same thing with air tableable
and same thing with notion. And the use
case that you can think of this is
pretty much anything any task that you
want a singular input data store. So you
basically have let's say one chat
message right where you have one place
and through a series of inputs. So
through a series of send Gmail, send an
air table or create a notion task or
whatever it is, it takes actions in
different softwares without us having to
create a new automation for every single
uh action that we want to take.
In this video, I'm going to walk you
through everything that you need to know
about data transformation and using JSON
within your automations. Now I know this
topic scares quite a few people and it
scared me coming into automation as a
beginner with no technical knowledge but
it actually is quite easy and very very
important to understand. All right so
JSON 101 JSON stands for JavaScript
object notation. So if you see
JavaScript here and there it stands for
JSON cuz it's JavaScript. So J S O N
right here. What it is? It's a way for
servers to store and transfer data.
Right? It looks like text, but it's
structured so computers can read it.
Now, the best way that I can describe
JSON is English for computers. It's the
language that computers use to speak to
each other, right? And that's why it's
very, very important for us to
understand it because pretty much
everything is built in JSON, right?
APIs, which I spoke about in another
video up here, uh, config files,
databases, but also your favorite
platforms like make.com, Nitan, or
Zapier, they're all built on JSON. It's
crazy to me that people still don't
understand that because behind the
nodes, the squares, and the [music] the
steps, if you really look at it, it's
all JSON. That's why it's very very
important to understand. Now, we use a
very basic structure uh in JavaScript.
[music] When we write JSON, we use key
value pairs. So, the keys are strings.
They're always going to be in quotes.
And the values can be string can be my
name, number can be an age, boolean
which is true or false. Null when you
get no data it's going to be zero zero
data object which is basically a JSON
inside the JSON and array which is a
list of items which I'll walk you
through step by step. So these are all
the different types of values that you
can get using the key. Here's an example
of a basic key value pair. We have the
key which is name. We have the value
which is mika in quotes because it's a
text string. The age which is key right
which again is in quotes because it's
always a string. The age which is not in
quotation marks because it's an age so
it's number. Then student and then true
which is boolean true or false right? So
we have again name key and key and these
are values but they're different types
of values. Now arrays are ordered in a
list inside of the brackets. Now let's
say you go to the grocery store and you
get the groceries, right? The groceries
isn't one thing. Groceries is a list of
items inside the key which is groceries.
And so this is the same exact example
when we have skills. So the key is
skills and the value is automation, AI,
notion which are my skills. And so why
do we use these? Well, we use this when
we have the same key like groceries or
skills. But we want to add multiple
items in the array, right? The array is
just the list of things um to to explain
the key, right? To explain skills, to
explain groceries, to explain whatever
it is. We have nested objects which are
JSON inside the JSON and for example we
have the key which is person the key is
also name but the name is inside the
person so it's JSON in JSON um and then
we have contacts which is email and
phone number so we have different pieces
of information but it follows a very
clear hierarchy. Hierarchy just means
what is the first thing that you should
see and then what is the next thing and
what is the next thing. Of course, the
first thing is person. The next [music]
thing is names. And we have contacts
within the name. And we have email and
phone number. And then we close off with
three curly brackets because we start
with 1 2 and three. Right? So nested
objects is usually the thing that we
always [music] use. And that nit
make.com usually uses when they want to
show different types of data inside the
data, right? So you might have a Google
sheet and the Google sheet might show
the ID of the sheet. It might show the
sheet name. It might show the row
values. It might show different types of
things. And so to show those things, it
uses the nested objects. And so JSON
applying into APIs. And if you've never
heard APIs, it's just basically how a
software speaks to a software. How these
softwares are actually able to work is
through APIs. This is a HTTP request,
which is a request that we send to a
server to do something. So in this case,
we have a curl, and a curl is just a
bunch of JSON. Now, don't worry about
what this means, but this is a request.
This is something that we sent to the
server saying, "Hey, can we get
something? Can we can we do something?"
Right? In case you want to get new rows
or you want to add a row to Google sheet
or you want to add a contact on ClickUp
or do something else, this is what you
use. And then the response, which is
always going to be in JSON, looks like
this. So let's say we're looking for
users in a software, let's say. And the
output that I get is the ID of the user,
the name of the user, the email, whether
the user is active or not, [music] and
the roles of the user, which is an array
because it can be different roles within
the same person. And so we have the keys
which are all inside the quotation marks
because they're all strings. [music] And
we have the values but the values can
change based on whether it's a number, a
string like this, a boolean or just an
array. So how does this now apply to
end? So if I go to edit first step, I
can add a manual trigger which is just a
first step of the automation manually.
And let me add another node which is
edit fields. Now this node right here is
very very important and it's something
that we typically use to transform data
which is getting an input which can be a
name it can be a bunch of values then
pulling it here right inside the edit
fields node which transforms the input
and then gives us the output. So if I go
here to mode I can see that I can do
manual mapping. Let me zoom in or I can
actually write things in JSON and this
again is the key value pair key value
which is the exact same as the thing we
spoke about. Now if I go to manual
mapping I can now start adding fields to
set. So I can say my full name is Mika
Tori right and I can say that this is a
string. Why is it a string? It's because
it's text. If I put number and I ran
this would be null because there is no
number. It's just text and it deletes
it. Right? And so if we go back to
string put my name. What I can do here
is execute the step which will show me
the output in schema which is basically
the way that we all look at it because
it looks a bit messy in JSON the table
version or JSON right so if you've never
pressed on this button JSON this is what
it looks like we have an object right
here we have the key and we have the
value right here
now let's say I wanted to do age and we
do um 20 if I execute the step now you
can see that the object right here is
increasing in the size because there's a
new key value pair. And bear in mind
that this is text right now. It's not a
number. So if I wanted to change this to
a number, look at the color list. It
changes the actual type of output, but
it changes the type of output that comes
here to 20. Let's say I wanted to do
boolean. This is true or false. I can
say student false or you can do true. So
we're saying, hey, [music] his name is
Mik Torti. He's 20 years old and he's a
student, right? And then you can also be
adding an array which in this case can
be skills like we mentioned before and
you do square bracket square bracket to
end it and you put skills. You say
notion
you finish it off then anything
then make and then you do something else
right but we are adding items inside the
array which is here and here which are
items right here. Boom. Now if I press
execute step this will now show the
skills like this. It will show the full
name. It'll show the age, the student
and the skills right here which are
wrapped up in square brackets right
here. Notion make and so on. And finally
we have the object right and the object
can be a summary. Let's call it summary.
And let's copy this full thing this
whole object because this is an object
again from here to here. And I can paste
this here. And if I execute this step,
this will now add the new object that we
have which is called summary. And we
have this again which we just copied up
here. Now why am I showing you this is
because typically when we get inputs
from the previous node, the previous
step, we send it here to then be able to
change the data. So let me show you an
example here. Let's say I have let me
delete this. Let's say I have the full
name and I wanted to get just the first
name. So let's say I run this and I have
the output which is full name. Let's say
I add another edit node right here. I
can go here. I can [music] remove this.
And now let's say I wanted to take the
full name and I wanted to transform it
into just the first name. What I do here
is I press here. I can say first name.
And if I go here to expression,
I can put curly bracket curly bracket.
And now inside here, it says anything
inside the curly bracket curly bracket
is JavaScript, which is JSON, right? All
right. So, we're saying I can actually
reference previous variables using this.
So, I can say dollar sign JSON, which is
the way that you start where you want to
reference some sort of item here, dot
full name, right? Which you got right
here, full name. And so, that is how you
can reference these variables from the
previous steps to the next steps. And
that's how dynamic variables work,
right? Because they are dynamic, they
change every single time. Cuz right
here, if I ran this, I would also have
the first name, which is Nicola Torti.
But if I go back here and change it to
James
and I ran this again, this will now be
James, right? Which is why it's dynamic,
which is why automations are brilliant
because they change data and you can
automate the process. So you don't have
to do it yourself. So okay, let's say we
have the full name here. Let me go full
screen by pressing this button right
here. And let's say I wanted to take
this name. I just wanted to get James.
Now inside N10 and the reason why I
would say for a beginner it looks a bit
technical uh because of this because
make.com doesn't actually show you this
but that's what it is in the back end I
can after the whole variable. So full
name which again is this what I can do
is actually use some formulas. So I can
put dot which now allows me to see
different things that I can do with this
full name. I can split the first name
which we're going to do. I can check
whether the um the name includes
something, right? So you can see here
whether the team includes T and it says
true. And so these are all formulas that
you can't use within your um the full
name. Honestly, you'll probably use
maybe five or six of these. So don't
even worry about understanding each one.
U one of them that I use a lot is split
because I usually want to split the full
name so I can get the first name. So in
this case, what we're doing here is
we're getting the full name which is
James Torty. What we're doing is saying,
hey, let's split this name by the
presence of a space. So it gives me
this, which is first name, and then last
name. And then we want to get the first
first one, which is James. And that's
the way that this works because
everything in JSON is logic. Everything
in code is logic, right? So if you put
logic here into this automation or not
automation in this variable, then you're
saying, hey, let's split
this by the presence of a space. So we
do the apostrophe here and we actually
put the space on our keyboard. So now we
can see that we have the first one and
we have the second one. And now after we
put split then we want to put dot first
because we're returning the first
element of the array cuz you can see
here this is an array right because it
has this comma this comma that right so
let's say I had the full name being
James Torty Arthur. It will then be
Jamesa Thory comma Arthur. And so after
this we want to put first. [music] And
this is how we get James. And that's how
in emails you can turn the full name
into a first name by using JSON and by
using formulas within the JSON. Now
you're looking at this right now. It
probably looks very overwhelming and it
was very overwhelming for me at the
start as well. But when you understand
the ones that actually do matter cuz
let's be honest, you're not going to be
using all these.
They work very well, right? Like if you
understand split for example and
understand that this is the formula they
use every single time to split a full
name from something else then you're
pretty much set. That's it right. And
the good thing is that you have an AI on
the right hand side that you can ask any
questions to which can also help you.
And so that is how we can transform
data. We can take some sort of full
name. We can then use some formula and
then we can output the first name right
from here to here. And that is data
transformation. That's how we use JSON
to be able to take an input and turn it
into something that's an output. And
quick side note here, if you're
wondering what's behind this, I
mentioned it's JSON. Let me show you
what I mean. I can copy this. I can go
here and if I paste this, this will be
JSON because these are nodes that have
parameters that have different stuff
which are all JSON. And the reason why
this and make.com works very well is
because we don't have to see this. But
just know that behind this is this,
right? So it's all JSON. That's why
understanding JSON is very very
important because it gives you the
understanding of how things actually
work together and how the English
language in computers actually works.
Now that we have this full name and
[music] then going to the first name now
we can add some branching. So we can add
some some conditions and we can add if.
So if is saying hey if this variable
which again we can get by doing curly
bracket curly bracket JSON dot first
name. So JSON dot the variable that's
here right JSON do first name equals to
James this will say true true branch and
if I go outside of here I can see that
this is a true branch this is a thing
that is true then we can now send the
automation one way if that specific
criteria or condition is true and if
it's false let me go down this way and
for example if I change the the name to
Mikuel execute the step now this will be
a false branch so this will go down the
false and again behind this what it does
is that it uses this variable. It then
says, hey, is this variable equal to
this? If yes, [music] then it's true. If
not, then it's false. Because again,
everything relies on logic. Everything
is logic in automations. Whether you
have this or whether [music] you have
this conditioning in two different
paths. All right. So, right here I have
an AI agent. So, we'll see how JSON
actually applies within the AI agent. I
can open chat and I can say hello.
And what it's doing now is it's it's
sending the information here JSON which
is session ID action and chat input
which is the thing that I just told it
to do. So these are different items that
we get as an output from the actual
thing. It's transferring the data. So
what you see here the line is actually
just transferring the data here to this
AI agent which is given the chat input
as an example in JSON here. Then using
the chat input is then talking to the
actual open AI by giving a JSON again
which is messages right here. And then
the output that we get using OpenAI is
this. Hello, how can I assist you today?
Which again is the output which goes
here. Hello, how can I assist you today?
So everything that you see within your
automations, data here and data there or
some sort of variable going to the AI
agent and then going to something else,
it's all JSON. That's how data flows
within different automations. And so
let's say now I wanted to take action on
my email. I can say send an email to
mika.25gmail.com
saying we have
uh football tomorrow. I can press go.
This will now send the data here. It
will then call the tool and then it will
send the email right and if I go inside
here I can see that this is the input.
The messages is the input, the subject
line and the email body and the output
is the response which is the email ID
that I just made, the thread ID which is
a thread of the email and then the label
ID telling us that this is sent. And
this right here is an object right right
here the same way that it was person
name, it was contact, it was whatever it
is. All right. And lastly here we have a
form that I just made. If I go to the
form, I can see that I have the full
name, the age, and the date. So I say
the age will be let's say 20 the date
let's say the date is today the 20th I
can press submit what this will now do
is it will send the data to our
automation and we get back the full name
which is a key value key as you can see
here this is a value but it's not in
quotation marks because it's a number
and then everything else is a key value
pair with this because it's all a string
it's all text now some fundamental rules
to remember for JSON is that the keys
must always be in double quotes. The
keys right here, name must always be in
these two quotes because it's always a
string. If you don't put it that way,
it'll break, right? The second thing is
to understand the difference between
string, number, boolean, null, object,
and array, right? and how these sort of
function because then you're able to
understand JSON as a whole because it is
just that it is just strings which are
text numbers which [music] are just
numbers with no quotation marks boolean
true or false null no data object which
is JSON inside the JSON and array which
is a list of values then we have the
third rule which is separating pairs
with commas so we have the key which is
name the actual value the next thing the
next thing and then the last one doesn't
have a comma the one nearest to the
actual curly bracket which finishes of
the JSON structure. And lastly is
wrapping the whole thing in quotation
mark if it's an object. And an object in
this case is just a list of key value
pairs, right? Key value, key value, key
value. And we wrap up the whole object
using curly brackets here and curly
brackets here to finish it off. And if
you're someone who's serious about
starting and scaling your AI agency,
then you might want to check out the
first link down below, which is a video
that walks you through our one-toone
mentorship program, which is a program
where we get to work with you onetoone
to help you start and scale your agency
to 10K a month.
Web hooks are by far one of the most
powerful thing within automation. Yet,
most people still have no idea how they
work. So, today I'm walking you through
exactly what a web hook is, how you can
use it in real life, and how you can set
it up within your own end. So by the end
of the video, you'll be able to use it
within your own automations, even if you
never touched it before. So let's dive
in. So what a web hook is is essentially
a URL that allows us to get notified
when something changes within an app. So
think of it as someone coming into your
house and ringing your doorbell. As soon
as they ring your doorbell, you
instantly get notified, right? And we
usually refer to this as an instant
trigger. That's exactly what a web hook
is. As soon as something happens, we
instantly get notified in the web hook.
Now, the business use case to this could
be someone filling out a form. So as
soon as the user fills out a form
whether it's in the website or something
else we instantly get notified. So the
web hook receives the data meaning
receive the responses from the form and
then starts the automation which is the
one right here. All right. So let's jump
on to any end right here real quick and
we can add the first step. So adding the
first step just asking us what is the
trigger? What is that thing that starts
the automation as I mentioned when
someone fills out the form the first
step will be the web hook because that's
the thing that allows us to actually
start the automation. Now the web hook
can be found here. So on web hook call
we can obviously trigger manually on app
event on a schedule form submission. We
can do a bunch of stuff but the web hook
itself is this one and it runs the flow
on receiving an HTTP request. Now HTTP
stands for hypertext transfer protocol.
Very fancy way of saying that data is
passed from one app to another when we
get notified right. So when we tap on
here we get introduced to this page
right here on the left hand side is
basically pulling in from the web hook.
So it's listening for new events. So
when we press this button it now the web
hook itself it's listening for
notifications coming from some server
some sort of server. till I stop
listening and in the middle this is the
configuration and on the right hand side
is the output. So when we get notified
the notification will show up here. So
right here the first thing that we see
is the difference between a test URL and
a production URL. Now this is quite
misunderstood between uh what they are
but a test URL. So if you look at the
the actual thing the actual URL in this
case it says test but production doesn't
have test. Now when you want to deploy
which means that when you want to
activate your automation you typically
want to uh use the production URLs.
That's the main use case for this. But
you can use the test when you test and
production is again when you want to
activate your automation. Now right here
you can see that you have a URL. So
again the web hook itself is URL that's
accessible to anyone. It's literally it
goes on the web. It's just a normal link
that you can use for anything that you
do. So if I press here I can actually
copy it and I can go to to Google and
actually search it. But again this is a
thing that allows us to actually get
notified when something happens. And we
also get this this long string. So this
is the the unique part which is 38 26 BB
2D 9056 and this is the path. This is
what we call a path. Now the path can be
changed to something else like hello
right hello whatever it is or we
typically want to have a long string. It
doesn't really matter but again this can
be this can vary. This can change right
and it doesn't really matter what you
put here. Now when it comes to the web
hook itself we have different types of
method. Now when you want to get
notified from a server you typically
want to use one of these different HTTP
methods. So the HTTP method can be a get
which is getting information head patch
post put and delete. Really the only
ones that I've actually used after
building hundreds of automation is get
and post. So a server could say hey I'm
sending you the notification but it
needs to be a put request or a post
request or get request. Right? So this
is the thing that you put here. The path
again I explained which is the last part
of the web hook. Authentication is
basically saying do you want to add a
password? So only you only the people
who know the username and password can
actually access it. You can use it but I
don't really use basic o and header or
JSON web token off. It doesn't really
matter like the difference between that
doesn't really matter but just know that
they're used as a way for us to say hey
don't breach across this point. You need
to have a password to actually use it.
So that's what we use authentication for
but typically I would have it as none.
And then for the response we have
immediately we have when last note
finishes. So immediately just means like
when this happens immediately send the
data here we can have when last node
finishes return the data when the last
node which means that the last step of
the execution is finished the last step
of the automation and then it sends the
data back and we can use a respond to
web hook node which I'll show you in
just a second and then streaming as well
which we don't really use uh so don't
worry about it too much and then we have
different options so for options I would
usually have the raw body so in case we
need it but for most of the times
because we're getting notified because
we're getting something we wouldn't use
any options but you can have the opt
option to basically have some different
options here that you can use for the
different types of requests that you're
getting but typically we wouldn't put
anything here. So with that being said
if we go here to web hook when I spoke
about the respond to the web hook we
also get a web hook response respond to
the web hook. So what this means is that
when we get notified from the server we
can actually give it a response back to
the server. So let me show you what I
mean. So because this is accessible on
the internet I can copy this I can
listen for the test event and let me
just go like here and then I can see
that now the message says workflow has
started. So if I go back here I can see
that [music] on here I get a bunch of
output. So I get the user agent Mozilla
which is basically telling everything
about my browser a bunch of Kodi stuff
that you have to worry about but just
know that because we opened it on the
browser it's basically giving us a bunch
of information that we then can use for
the automation. So, let me show you
exactly what I mean by respond to web
hooks. So, let's say we add this here
and I go in here and I say all incoming
items. So, we're basically saying, hey,
I'm going to give you back everything
that you gave me. So, if I execute this
workflow,
I think I have to change this to yeah,
you respond to web hook as well because
this is the response. Execute the
workflow. And now I go here, I can see
that I get a bunch of different text. So
this is exactly what sends to us. But
because we're sending it back, we get
everything here. So that's why it's
sending us everything back. All right.
So you understand what a web hook is
now. You understand sort of the
different things, the different
settings. Let's actually put it to work
and see how it actually works in a
business case scenario. If I go here,
let me just put it in production mode.
And let me copy this. Um the workflow
that we're going to basically make is
starting from a type form, which is
someone filling out a form. And then we
can add it to let's say a Google sheet.
and then we can send an email back to
the person that filled out the form. So,
let me go to type form. So, this right
here is the type form that we're going
to use for this test right here. It all
starts with full name, email, and what
are you looking for? Very, very simple.
You can obviously add more details like
company name, budget, whatever it is
that you have. Uh, but let's start here.
I want to show you exactly when we fill
out this form, how does it send the
information to NN. So, let me go to
workflows. Let me go to web hooks right
here. So, you can connect with any app
to send responses or trigger actions,
which is exactly what we want. We want
to add a web hook which will take us to
this page. We can add a web hook. And
then here is where we go inside and we
actually what is it? Production URL.
Let's copy this and let's put it into
here. And we can save the web hook. Now
once this is done, we can we typically
want to send a test request to make sure
that it does work. So let me go here. Go
inside and listen for test events. I can
send a test [music] request. And now
it's giving me an error. So let's see
why it gives me an error. So below on
the response we can see the workflow
must be active for a production URL to
run successfully. You can activate the
workflow using toggle. Okay. So this is
what I meant before. So if you go here,
I just pasted the production URL. Let's
do the test URL because again the
production URL only works when you
activate the automation. So let's do
test URL. Let me copy this. Let me go
here. Let me replace
web hook.
And now we can test it again. So let me
listen for event
and I can test [music] the request. In
this case it's giving me another error.
So let's see the response. And now it's
telling me the web hook is not
registered for post request. Did you
mean to make a get request? So now this
is goes back to the fundamental where I
told you some servers ask us to do a
different request. So in this case for
the HTTP they say hey this is not set up
to do a post request. So all we have to
do is set up to the to do a post request
in this case. And then we can try again
go here and then send a test request.
And now it should be successful right at
200 which means it's all good. The
workflow has started. And if I go back
to end I can see that we have the output
which is successful right which is
everything. Okay cool. Now now that we
know that this works and we know that we
get a request whenever this is post and
is test just to test until we set it to
active. We can then fill out the form
and see the data that we get. Go here
listen for events. go back to TY form
and then I can activate this because you
want this to be on every single time. I
can copy the length to the TI form and
then I can start filling it out. So let
me do malatory
my name or my email
and what are you looking for? I want to
learn automations
and I can press submit. And now this
information will be sent to NN right
here with a different output. So we have
headers which is just a bunch of fancy
stuff that you want to look at. But then
what we actually care about is not the
body but the responses. Where is it? Uh
the answers. So matory my name the email
is this and the text the third one is
this. So these are the ones that we're
going to use for the next steps. The
form submitted. It sends the data to the
web hook. It's like hey we have this
data. Someone just submitted the form.
Now use it for whatever you want to use.
Here's a notification. Okay. Once we
have this, what we can do now is we can
add it to our Google sheet. So, let's
make a Google sheet right now.
Let's name it new form request.
Let's do full name. Just the the
variables that we had. Email
uh once. Let's just do once. So, let's
connect this to it end. So, I go here. I
can press plus. I can go go to sheets
and then what I need to do is append a
row and a sheet
connect it. All you have to do is go
here sending with Google very very
simple and then I can do sheet within a
document. Append a row which means add a
row and a document will be new form
request. There we go. The first one and
then the sheet will be one. We want to
map each column manually because we want
to do this manually. And then the full
name will be the one here. Where is it?
There we go. Text. because this [music]
is the text that we got. And you know
this because these are the answers,
right? You wouldn't put it here if it
wasn't the answers. And then email would
be the one here. So you just drag it
across and once will be the last thing
which is I want to learn automations. So
it's always good to test because when
you go here, how would you know this is
the answers, right? I mean it says
answers right here. But it's much better
if you test to get actual answers that
you know you put. So you can just map
them here. And this is all good. So I
can just execute step which means I'm
just testing it. This is executing. So
if I go here to the sheet, I can see
that this is already added. So let me
add this to bold. And then I know this
works. So I can go to the last step
which is sending an email. So email in
this case will be Gmail. Uh create a
message. No, send an email. Yeah, send a
message. All I have to do to connect to
Gmail to to an end is go here. Send them
to Google. Very very simple like Google
Sheets. And then here I have to put
message send because we're sending the
message. And in this case, who are we
sending the email to? We can either pull
it from here or we can pull it from the
actual form itself which is the email
right I can put it here. The subject
line will be thanks for filling out
the form.
Then it's asking us for the email type.
Now HTML is just the way that we make
our emails fancy. We can leave this as
text because we don't need to use HTML.
We can go here full screen and then here
I can say hey I can go down to my name
say hey Mika. And obviously, ideally, we
want to have just the first name. And
that goes into formulas. I don't want to
get into this uh just for this video
because it's a bit more complex. But I
can say, "Hey, Mik, just saw
our team. We'll get back to you
as soon as possible."
Thanks.
All right. Cool. So, we said, "Hey, web
hook name, which is a variable that
we're pulling in from the form." Because
again, we're using dynamic variables. It
changes every single time. We're also
saying, "Hey, what do you want? Who do
you want to send an email to?" And
that's about it for the steps. So, let
me test it. Okay, I just realized that
it was actually wrong. I put an X row,
so I I actually didn't send the email.
Um, but you should be getting the email
when you send it through. Uh, I just had
to put one OS, but that's how that's
usually how it works. You just send it
and you get this output right here. So,
let's test it from the start until the
end. Let's execute the workflow and
let's do a new form. So, let's refresh.
Let me go here and say James Low. Let me
do my actual email without the extra
Omations
for lead generation.
Submit. We go here. It's talking to
Google Sheets to actually add it. But we
got the the output here. So if I go
here, I can see that the answers in this
case was James Low was email and then it
was automations for lead generation
which rhymes. And let me go to Google
sheet which appends around the sheet
which means that it added. So if I go
here, I can see that James though was
added. And obviously this would be a
project management tool. It could be a
CRM, whatever you have. Um, but we added
it here. So you can keep track of all
the different requests you're having.
And lastly, we have the email which was
sent this time with the right email. So
if I go to my email right here, I can
see that I have an email from which
says, "Hey, James Low, just saw you
filled out the form on the website. Our
team will get back to you as soon as
possible." Of course, you want to add
more. And then it actually sends this as
well, which is which we don't want. So
all we have to do is go here and then we
can go to append nnn attribution. We can
turn this off so that whenever it sends
us an email it doesn't say this part
which we don't want. All right. So that
right there is basically how you use web
hooks on nnn. I want to quickly show you
how it looks like on a different
platform which is make.com. So if I go
to make.com
I can log in. This is just another
automation platform like nn. It's just
between n zapier and make.com. Make.com
it's it's fairly easier to to get
started with. But if I go here, I can
see that to add the web hook to
make.com, all you have to do is go here
and there's literally web hooks here and
you can create a custom web hook which
is the same. So create a web hook, name
it whatever you want. So mik
test this would be the URL that we had
before. So in nn it will be this.
This URL right here in make.com it will
be this. They all have their own in like
internal different names. In this case,
it's make.com and for nnn it's
nnn.cloud, right? So, they have their
own unique sort of way that they name
their um their web hooks. But on a high
level, this is very very this is
literally pretty much the same. Like it
has the same functionality. All the web
hooks are pretty much the same. It's
just that the way they look is different
because of the way that um that this is
set up. Press save. And this is much I
don't want to get into make.com cuz
that's more of a different video. But I
just wanted to show you how it looks
like to actually make a webbook on a
different platform. And lastly, I want
to show you how to send a data point
from not from a form but from another
scenario to a web hook. Right? If I go
to another scenario right here. So, let
me go out. Let me go here.
Let me create a new workflow. And now,
because I spoke about HTTP at the start,
but in order for me to have a workflow
and then send the information from that
workflow to the next workflow through a
web hook, uh I can then actually use a
HTTP request. So let me show you exactly
what it will look it will actually be
much more clear when I actually run
this. But all I have to do is [music]
copy this and let me take this out. So I
copy the web hook that I need and now we
will get data from the from the previous
workflow. So if I execute the workflow
here I can go here and then I can send
the URL which would be basically saying
hey I'm sending the data to you right
and the web hook is getting notified. In
this case, the method would always be
post just because we're posting
information because that's sending
information from one place to another.
Authentication is zero. And then we can
also send a body. The body will be
anything that you wanted to do. So you
can say uh full name. So I should do
case full name.
So common case you just just want the
capital letters to be this. So this
right here will send the information
with it. So if I execute the step first
of all I have to run this
it's already running right now it's
waiting for this. So if I [music]
execute the step now
it will send the information and I can
see that we have in the body right here
we have full name Mikuel. So imagine if
you had a workflow right here which
could send different variables so
different things from one workflow to
another. So you can split it up and you
have all the different workflows talking
to each other because you have web hooks
and because you have HTTP requests. This
is a whole another topic in itself, but
I wanted to show you the overall sort of
arcing thing of what a web hook is, how
it can be used in a business sense, how
it can be used or what the fundamentals
are and how everything works together,
how you can link it from automation to
automation as well.
In this video, I'm going to show you how
you can handle any errors inside of Nen
so your AI agents and your workflows are
smarter, stronger, and make sure that
they actually work. All right, so the
first one here is retry when failure. So
this happens when the workflow stops
working because of some reason and then
we tell it to run x amount of times in x
interval and you know a node you know
what step has this exact error handling
technique because you will see this
right here which says retry when fail.
So if I go inside the HTTP request which
is a again a node a thing that we used
to send a request to some server in the
internet asking for information we can
execute the step and basically what this
is it's a server where it allows me to
get any images of any dog randomly I got
this dog right here right and I can keep
going again and again and as you can see
it's [music] successful why is because
the status is success and I also know
this because there's a green check mark
right which tells me that everything
went good now what happens if something
goes is wrong. Well, if I remove the E,
right? Cuz before there was image, now
there's no image. [music] This will now
stop working. This will say there's an
error. As you can see, the resource
you're requesting could not be found.
And if I go here, let's say you have a
whole workflow behind it. It will stop
here, right? And so, why is this bad?
Well, it's because sometimes some
servers just stop working randomly,
right? They stop working for 1 to 2
seconds, maybe 3 to 4 seconds, [music]
which is why we use the retry when
failure. So the way to set this up is to
go to settings. You then have this
setting turned on, retry on fail, which
means that you're saying, "Hey, retry
[music] these many times in this
interval." So it stops working, it tries
once, then it waits 1,000 milliseconds
until it tries again. Wait, tries again,
right? And so it does it three times to
make sure that we say if it doesn't
work, that's cool. We'll try again after
this amount of time, right? And try
back, try back, try back until it works.
And so if I go here and I run this,
[music] let me put a manual trigger. I
think I have this manual trigger. There
we go. I can execute the workflow. And
as you can see, this is now looping
around [music] because it's actually
waiting or it's trying again after those
many times in that interval. So let's
say I take this off,
right? All I have to do now is execute
the workflow and it will instantly
[music] error out. But by turning this
on, retry when failure, it will wait,
right, to try again and again and again.
and at the end it will stop but there's
some process of them going through it
they're trying again um before it goes
to the next step this can be applied to
LLMs because sometimes open AAI claw
Gemini they just stop working and we
have no clue why and so to make your
automation more scalable so that it just
doesn't stop every single time something
goes wrong then make sure you have this
the second technique is called the
continue when failed now we allow the
workflow to continue even when it fails
and so theoretically right logically
this step right here where you would
continue even if it fails fails has to
be something where if it fails amazing
we still keep going. If it succeeds we
keep going. So it can be a step that's
very very important in the whole logic
of the flow. It has to be something
where if it's great great if not then
it's fine. And so the way to set this up
is you have to go to on error and here
we have three options. In this case it
would just be continue. And so what we
do here is it continues and it actually
sends the error output right the error
message to the next step. So if I go
here I added an extra s. I can go here
or extra F in this case and I can see
that this is the message that I get. Now
on the outside everything looks great
because you can see that this succeeds
right there's a check mark but on the
inside all we get is a message right we
get this error message that we can then
[music] use to give to the next step. If
I go here to the next step I can then
pull the error message through to here
like a normal variable I can execute
[music] the step and this is the output
that we get right here. The third
technique is called split error root.
Now split error routt is a technique
that we use in a lot of our automations
to split the automation based on the
logic because everything is logic. What
that means in the plainest of English is
this step runs if this step actually
succeeds then it goes one way if it
errors out so something goes wrong then
we go the next way. Now typically this
is great because with automations
because everything is built on logic
then we would typically have a route. So
if something goes right or everything
goes right then it goes one way and it
continues the automation. If something
goes wrong, then we notify our team
saying, "Hey guys, something went
wrong." And so if I go inside here,
I can see that now I have the same exact
API that we had before. And this will
now go through the success branch, not
the error branch. But if there's an
error, so extra F, I can execute the
step. And I can see that now it goes to
the error branch, which is this one
here. And the way to set this up is if
you go to settings on error. So again,
what happens when there's an error?
[music] you can continue using error
output, right? It passes the item to an
extra error output, which means that it
gives us two different paths to [music]
go down with our automation, one here
and one here. And if I go to my email,
which in this case is a step that we
have right after there's an error in a
workflow. We can send the error message
as an output, which in this case looks
like this, right? And so right here, I
have the workflow. And in this case,
let's say it's a success, right? Just
take the f out here. You can execute
this and it goes the next way.
And if I go to my email, right, and I
have this error here, no root or get
XYZ. Now, honestly, this right here
makes no sense to any normal human
looking at this unless you know APIs and
so on. You could delete all these
things, all these lines, uh, just to
make it look cleaner. Um, and yeah, you
could have this so you're notified when
something happens. Now, there actually
is a better way when it comes to uh
using the notification when something
errors out, which I'll show you in the
last technique. But this is great
because it gives us two options, right?
It gives us the success option and it
gives us the error option, all within
the same workflow. The next technique is
actually within the AI agent. So, if I
go to the AI agent and I go on chat and
I can say hello, what this does is that
it talks to the brain, [music] right?
Because again, we mentioned that the
brain is the LM, which means an AI that
helps it think through what it needs to
do. [music] new instructions based on
the prompt that we have inside. Now,
this is all great until this stops
working, right? There is a chance that
this just errors out, that this LLM just
errors out, which is where we add a
fallback agent LLM. So, if I go inside
here, I can see that I have an option
here to enable fallback model. If I turn
this off, that means that it removes the
option for me to add a fallback agent
LLM. As you can see, this is [music]
just a glitch that Ant needs to fix. uh
but you will have no option here as
well. And so the thought behind this is
okay cool if we run this and it goes
here to the agent then the agent called
its brain because that's how it thinks
and it doesn't work then we just break
[music] the whole thing right and so why
don't we add a step in the middle where
if it doesn't work here it then [music]
uses a different LLM to be able to try
again and so that's where we go in here
we turn this on and we start adding the
fallback agent [music] LLM. Now the
fallback agent LLM ideally it would be a
different LLM because if OpenAI doesn't
work in that moment it will probably not
work in that moment as well. Um so you
want to make sure that you connect it to
another LLM and you will be able to then
use this as a fallback. So if I go here
rename this fallback,
it will use this model right here in
case this one doesn't work. So right
here if I go inside and I go to my
connection and I just name it fail
save just put an API key fake one uh if
I go out I can see that now I have a
fake credential called fail which means
that now it shouldn't work right and so
if I go here to open chat I can say
hello this will now go here there's an
error and see how it instantly talks to
the next fallback LLM to then give you
an answer now this is great because a
lot of the times like I mentioned LLM's
don't work, right? And so you want a
some sort of fallback, some sort of
agent that they can rely on if the first
one doesn't work. It's sort of like
you're playing sports. You have the main
people and then the bench, right? Which
is me when I was younger. And so when we
have the main guy who's playing and the
main guy gets injured, then it calls
another guy and then they call me. But
in this case, they call the guy on the
bench and the guy on the bench is a
fallback l. All right. The next one is
called the error workflow. So this is
what I meant by the other way of doing
this [music] split error root because we
actually set up a completely new
automation which receives any error that
comes from any automation in our
workspace and then we can do whatever we
want. Now this has to be a separate
automation. So this is just the
automation that we're running now,
right? But [music] this will be a node
that we add in a different automation.
Now the way to set this up is we need to
have a workflow. We have to activate
this right here. Once I activate this,
all I have to do is go make a new
workflow like this, which has the error
trigger. And again, you can't activate
this because it doesn't let you cuz this
is already activated. You want to go
here. You want to go to settings. You
then want to go [music] and choose the
error workflow, which in this case is
this, right? Which is the workflow where
the error trigger node is here. And you
just want to attach to it. So in this
case, for mine, it will be E with the R
right here. I can press save. And now
what happens is that I just connected
this automation to the error workflow so
that whenever something wrong happens
here, it sends a data or sends a
notification on the other workflow. So
[music] let me test it out. So now let's
say we go inside here and we execute the
step. This should now work right here.
Should give us a picture of a dog,
right? Um and what we want to do here is
we want to make sure that this will run
now every 5 seconds. That's fine. Let me
make sure there's an error here. So F.
Let me run this. So there's an error.
Okay, cool. Now if I press save, this
will now run the workflow every 5
seconds. And it should now send the
notification to a workflow every 5
seconds because there's an error here.
So if I go inside here, I go to editor
again just to refresh cuz you have to
reload the actual automation. You go to
executions.
I can see now that we have new errors
coming every single time. And on the one
end, it's a error, right? But on this
end, it's a success because that's what
this job of the error node does. Now,
because I'm actually paying for
executions, I'm going to disactivate
this. But as you can see here, we now
have a bunch of different workflow
executions that we can then [music] use
to then be able to send ourselves an
email, right? So, if I go in here, I can
see that I have the URL of the workflow,
the description, which actually makes
sense in plain English, that we can now
use to actually build out our workflow
here. So if I go to copy the editor,
which means that it now pins the actual
output that we got from that run. I can
then go to Gmail,
I can send a message, obviously connect
to Gmail by going here, press sign in
with Google, and you'll be good to go.
Message send. Let's do my email. Let's
do subject line, which means [music] you
can say error in workflow. And then the
email type, let's just do text because
HTML is basically saying, "Hey, let's
make it look pretty." We don't have to
[music]
saying, "Hey, Mikuel,
there was
an error in this [music] workflow."
So URL,
you can put the URL here. Error
description,
and you can put the description [music]
here. And you can go
level and you can do warning. They're
saying, "Hey, to what extent do we have
to worry about this?" You can just do
[music] warning. And now what I can do
is I can run this and in that case it
will error out and it will send me an
email every single time with those
variables that change. And if I go to my
email, I can see here that I have error
in workflow. Say, "Hey, there was an
error in this workflow. The error
description is this. The URL is this."
And if I actually go inside the URL, it
will take me directly to the execution
of the error of the workflow, which is
amazing, right? Because now we can go
here. We can try this again, right?
Where we basically try it again with
with something that actually works.
[music] And now we can rerun the
execution to make sure that we don't
actually lose the data of this. It's all
here. So, those are pretty much the only
error handling techniques that you need
to know inside of any to make sure that
you have a way to handle errors. Because
what you start to realize when you're
working with clients is that building it
for fun when a YouTube video like this
and building it for a client is a tiny
bit different. You want to make sure
that these actually work every single
time, right? Because sometimes when
we're building it for fun, we don't
think about what if it goes wrong,
right? We just actually build it. It
looks cool. [music] It works in that
moment, but what if it doesn't work? And
that's when we use these techniques
depending on your use case to be able to
mitigate that error to be able to uh be
safe when something happens.
Hey, so in this video I'm going to show
you 30 edit and hacks that I wish I knew
when I got started that'll help you make
your workflows at least three times
faster and save a ton of money on
execution. All these are hacks that I
had to learn the hard way over the
course of the past 12 months building
and selling automation to businesses. If
that sounds like something that you want
to improve on and learn, then this video
is for you. Let's dive in. So the first
hack is actually software updates. So
sometimes when you build automations on
Nitnen and a lot of times when you watch
videos of people actually adding steps
to the automation and they go here and
they look at an app sometimes you don't
have it in your own software. It's
because Nitan actually updates the
platform so that they're able to add
more and more uh nodes more and more
actual executions or or stuff to the
platform so that you are able to make
your workflows more efficient. And so
the thing you have to do the way to
update your your workflow or your uh
account is to go to sign in. You'll be
brought to this page. All you want to do
here is you want to manage. You want to
go here and you want to press the latest
version. In this case, this is beta. So,
you might want to press the one below or
alpha or the latest stable in this case,
which is the most stable version of
Nitto end as of right now. That'll help
you build your workflows in the current
version. The second hack is deactivating
workflow. So, let's say I have a
workflow right here, trigger manually.
Have a HTTP request which talks to a
server. And then step after this is edit
or set fields. So, x equals y. Right?
And in here, let's say I have my
website.
So if I press execute step, now this
will scrape the website. Now let's say I
run this whole workflow. This will run
this, this, and this successfully. But
let's say I had a problem when I was
running this. Let's say I add some more
stuff. Now if I execute workflow, this
will stop right here. And we were
building automations on edit and we want
to execute this. Even if this fails,
then all you have to do is press on the
node and press D. This way it
deactivates the node so that you're able
to run even the next step without this
without this influencing the decision
itself and this stops. It doesn't even
consider this node right here when it's
running the automation. So if I execute
workflow even though there's an error
here it didn't run it and it will go to
the next step. The third hack is not
really a hack but it's more so the fact
that edit end does not charge you for
the amount of test executions that you
do when you're testing the workloads. So
what I mean by this is that we tested
this this and this. These are three
different or this is one execution. But
if I go to the admin panel, as you can
see, right right now I have zero. And if
I run this across right now, I also have
zero again. Right? So when you're
testing automations in Nitn, the the
actual amount of executions that you do
or work for executions that you do when
you're testing does not count to the
amount that you have to pay every single
month. So to show you when you have to
pay for something, I just added a
schedule trigger. I'm going to activate
this. So now this is going to run every
10 seconds. If I go here, I can see that
this is running right now for 2 3 4
seconds. is successful. And if I go here
to the admin panel, I can refresh and I
can see that now I have one execution
out of the 2,500 that I have every
single month. So this is more so how
edit actually charges you on the
platform. Uh but just know that when
you're testing the automations, you are
not charged for the execution workflow
executions that you do on a testing
phase. The next hack is actually pinning
data. So let me remove this. Let me put
a trigger manually. We have this. Let's
say I have to run this every single
time. You see how this may take 10
seconds, may take 15 seconds. And to
test this step, let's say I wanted to to
do all the data here. So let me drag
this across. Now if I drag this across,
so if I execute the workflow, the data
here, the result that we get is a result
from the previous step. And if I have to
get this points of data, I have to rerun
the whole thing over and over again.
Well, not really because any just added
the feature of uh pinning data. So you
can go here and actually pin the data so
that we're able to execute this workflow
almost instantly right here without
having to wait for this nodes to run
because we have test data to work with.
This is great when you have a 100 node
workflow when you have a lot of steps.
So let's say I copy paste this and I
have all these steps. So let's say now
we have a four-step execution. If I want
to execute the workflow here, let's say
I wanted to get the data from the HTTP
without having to run it. I can use the
test data that we have in order to
actually get the data. In this case, the
HTTP was not run because of the fact
that it is pinned. But now when you want
to activate the scenario and you want to
get different data every single time
using the HTTP request, you want to
unpin this. And to do this, you can
press P again. So you can P and P.
That's another hack. Another hack here
is actually something that a lot of
people underuse, which is the AI feature
on Nitto N. If I go here to ask the
assistant and ask it, hey, can you or
hey, how can we build a human in the
loop
agent? This AI assistant is one of the
best that I've seen on any automation
platform out there because what it does
is that it thinks it actually thinks
through what it needs to do but then it
consults through the community through
the documents first and then a community
that has full of people who actually um
engage with the community and as you can
see it says answer in the community. So
it gives you three different places that
it pulls information from. So it gives
you a very very contextual answer and
does actually help quite a lot when
you're building automations. Another
hack here is that when I go inside this
for example and I want to remove this
and I want to pull in data from the HTTP
request. Usually I would have to drag
and drop this here. But as you can see
this is actually code. So if you can
actually map this without having to drag
this across. All you have to do is
square bracket square bracket. I can go
dollar sign. I can then look for the
nodes that we have to reference. In this
case, hey, I want to get information
from the HTTP request node, the edit
fields node or the other edit fields
node right here. Let's say I want to do
HTTP request. I can then put dot and
then I have this option right here to do
the item which is exactly the one that
we want to do. In this case, I can now
still get the output I got before
without having to drag and drop this.
So, the next hack is actually something
that I've never seen anyone say out on
YouTube before, which is the ability for
us to add images on our notes. So, notes
are a way to document your your
automation, which I think is one of the
best uh things that actually put out,
which is something that are lacking in
the auto automation platforms or the way
that we have it set up here. So let's
say I have a note and I do image one.
Now here instead of putting text which
you normally would right you're not
limited by text but you can also add
images. So the way to add an image is to
put an exclamation mark. You do a square
bracket this
again. And now you would have to put the
image URL right here. So right here we
have an image URL which you have to put
to then be able to see our image here.
So let me pull in an image that I have
uh from the web. And so what I did is I
actually took a screenshot of this. I
made it into a public URL so anyone can
access it. And if I paste it, I can see
now that I have the image of this
automation here. You can imagine now
this gives you a lot of possibilities
when you're documenting things to
actually add documents or add document
pictures or pictures, whatever it is
that you have to put to add to the
documentation that you're putting for
other people to look at your
automations. All right. So the next hack
is an error handling hack. So if I go
here, delete this and let's say I have a
set node behind or before this. Let me
do copy and paste another hack right
there. Paste this. And I say I do I give
it jm solutions.com.
So now I want to pull this variable and
put it in here. Drag this across. So
then now this is basically scraping
whatever it's trying to access anything
that I put here. Let's say I run this.
Now I get an invited URL right here
because this right here does not have an
HTTP https which which is which is what
we need in order for us to actually run
this. Now let's say I go here and I go
to executions. I can see that here we
have an execution telling us hey you ran
this there was an error. So there's two
things we actually can do. The first one
is debugging editor. So we are able to
access the way that the workflow was
when it errored which is great because
now we can see exactly what it is that
the input was. what is the output? But
also the thing we can do is press this
button right here which is retry with
currently saved workflow. So what this
means is that you run a workflow. So you
run an automation. In this case it's
this. Let's say your error is out. You
want to try again with the same data
that we had so we don't lose different
things. So let's say we had a Google
sheet that was running every single day
and it caught the most recent 100 rows.
Let's say one row failed. You still want
to execute that same row even if it
failed because it is important to us
because it's still a data point that we
want to process. The next hack is
actually a switch mode. go here to edit
node and I put x= y. This is just
something that we put just to test. Now
the next step can actually be a switch
node right here. So the switch node
allows us to do different things. The
the first thing that allows us to do is
to basically send the automation
different ways based on where we want it
to go and based on different criteria.
So in this case we have routing rules.
So this means hey if this equals that
then send it this way. If that equals
this then send it this way. So we say we
had a very easy sort of thing. adding
rule V or in this case let's execute a
step says we had this equals to Y and
this equals to X right so in this case
now if I run this and again this is
called 01 I can run this and it will
send it this way because this is set to
Y right and the second thing was Y so
there's actually one hack that we can do
here because we can rename the output so
right here instead of having zero and
one we can have this is X or this is Y
in this case and here I can have this is
X. So that here I can see that this is
this is Y and this is this is X which is
amazing when we're trying to uh let's
say we get emails we get an email that
we get and let's say that if the email
contained something in the subject line
it was a support email or a FAQ email or
something email then we would rename
this with support Q&A or something else
right and it's amazing because it allows
us to visually see exactly what's
happening in the workflow. All right.
So, next one is actually the edit end
attributions. So, if I go to Gmail and I
send myself an email. So, let's do send
a message. Let's put my email
do hello.
Hey there. And I run this. This will use
my email to send my email. So, if I go
here, I can see that on the email
itself, it says this email was sent
automatically with Niten. Now, ideally,
we don't have this or we don't want to
have this when we're using it for
businesses who are sending email to
clients because we want it to feel more
personal and we don't want to exactly
say this is an automation, right? So,
what we do here is actually remove the
uh edit end attribution. So, if I go
back here and I go to add options, I can
see that I have append edit and
attributions. If I turn this off now, if
I rerun the automation, you can see that
I got another email from Mika Gem
Solutions, but now there was no edit and
attribution. There was no, hey, edit and
send this. so that we can actually send
emails that feel more personal that
doesn't don't tell them, hey, edit and
send this. We have an automation set up.
Um, so you can actually use it for your
own clients. So the next hack is
actually on edit and forms and it's the
way that we actually design the form. So
if I go in here and I want to execute
the workflow and I want to let's see
test the form. We can see that we have
this color right here. We have this
font, this color, this layout which is
standard for end. But what if you had a
company that wanted something with their
own brand colors that we can send to
clients that makes the client feel more
more aligned with or more envision with
with the company itself? We can actually
customize it. So to do that, we can add
an option. We can go to custom form
styling and it gives you this code right
here. So if we copy this and go to
childbt and we say can you also or can
you or this is the nitn
um general styling form styling code. I
want the
general color and theme to be blue to be
light blue.
Again, this you will substitute this
with anything that the client has like
brand colors and so on. So now we let
charge BT run. And this is all within
CSS, which is just a way a programming
language. It allows us to change the
design of things. All right. So it just
finished. And by the way, uh these right
here when you see hashtag something
something something, it just says blue
color, blue, white, blue, uh blue, and
very light blue. These right here
represent colors. So if I copy this and
I go back to edit end, can paste it
here. And if I want to execute the step,
I now see that the form is in my brand
colors. It's blue. And you can do
whatever you want with it. You can
obviously customize the background and
so on, but this add that little touch to
us actually being able to customize the
form for whatever you want for brand
colors. All right. So the next hack is
on a schedule trigger. So we use a
schedule trigger. We want to run the
automation maybe once a day, once once a
year, uh every second, every whatever it
is, right? But now we can actually
customize it even more as in the time
triggers like when it actually runs. If
you go here to trigger interval. So this
is you want to run every second,
minutes, hours, days, weeks and months.
We can actually do a custom cron. So
chron is a way that we express time. So
if I go here to documentation, I can see
that now I have a lot more a lot more
options. You can do a custom. So we can
do it every day at 2 a.m. And I can copy
this and then paste it here.
And this signifies every day at 2 a.m.
And it tells you that second, minute,
hour, day of the month, month, day of
the week. And this over here is a very
custom way that you can uh obviously run
your automations. But I think it's
really really cool that we get to that
we're able to run automations whenever
we want in a very very custom order. I
mean, we have a ton, right? We have
every midnight, every Sunday, every
Thursday, once a week. This gives us a
lot more flexibility when we're building
automations. All right. So the next hack
is actually on the workflow and the way
that data actually moves and the the
sequential order that it moves. So an
example here is when we have an execute
workflow and let's say we have a series
of steps but we have two ways that the
automation can go through and it will go
through the two ways because we have no
filter involved but which one does it do
first? Well in this case if I execute
the workflow I can see that it goes up
here first it then waits 3 seconds cuz I
wanted to show you that it then does
everything. So this runs the workflow
that is actually on the top. So again if
I put this to the top we can see that
now it executes this first. And this
applies for anything you do in case you
have three, in case you have four in
case you have five. So if you're
wondering why your workflows are running
the way they are in the sequential
order, just know that it runs the first
workflow that it runs is the first uh is
the one on the top and then it goes
obviously on a worker level on a ladder
level until the end. All right. So the
next hack is actually on a web hook. If
I go here to web hooks,
I can see that we have a test URL and a
production URL. This is the exact same
that we have on forms within Nitn. And
just know that the test URL is only used
when you're testing the automations. And
once you set them to active, so once you
press this button right here, activate
this. Now this will now you have to
change the production URL right you have
to change the URL they're using for the
external server that we have to use uh
when you're putting it to active. So
just know that test URL is when you're
testing production URL is when the
automation is active. All right so the
next hack is actually calling another
workflow within a workflow. So let's say
I have an automation right here and I
then have x= y right it's good and now
the next step can actually be calling
another workflow to do something and
then giving us the data. So let's say I
have execute uh sub workflow which is
the action that we want to do. Now it's
asking us to source the database which
is fine and then it's asking us which
workflow do you want to call in order to
to send the data and actually execute
before getting the data back. So if I go
here I can actually create an sub
workflow. So I can go workflow personal
in this case and now I start from
scratch. So in this right here the
trigger will be when executed by another
workflow. Let's leave this to all accept
all data which means that it sends
everything. And now let's say I do edit
field do hello.
I say my name is Mik.
Let's say I do wait. I wait 5 seconds
before we send the data back. So let me
save this. As you can see we already
can't activate this because it always
runs whenever it's called. But here I
can then let me name this hello world.
I can now go here and I can choose hello
world to be the workflow that's executed
that's sent the data to before we get
the data back. In this case if I execute
it I can see that it's running because
it takes 5 seconds of course I mean we
have this step right here and then it
waits 5 seconds and then it sends it
back. If I go here I can see that we
have the data back which is my name is
Kelly. So this right here what it did is
that it sent the data to the workflow
and then got it back and now I can move
on to the next steps. If I go here I can
see that executions. So this was
successful and then it send the data
back. So this is great when you're
building automations because of the fact
that when you build a linear workflow,
which means that it follows a very
specific process and it's just one line.
You can't actually add more automations
here unless you actually call them,
right? So in this case, this sort of
acts as an AI agent um which is similar
to make.com's AI agent in the sense that
it actually calls workflows uh
predefined workflows and it gets the
data back. All right, so the next hack
is actually using a loop over items. So
in this case, we have an automation that
starts with the list of YouTube
channels. It then lists all the videos.
in scripts, the comments from these
videos in order for us to actually be
able to know exactly what people want
and in order for us to have a database
full of content ideas and hooks and
outlines that we can use to generate
content for us. By the way, if you want
to watch a full video, check it out
right here. And so right here when we go
to APify, Apiy is scraping all the
comments. But in this case, it gives us
505 comments which we then have to send
to AI. Now, typically with AI, it
doesn't actually take in or in this
case, it can't take so much context. It
can't take everything at once because
the way that Nit end works is that we
have different items. So in this case
505 items which are different comments
in this case, right? Different comments.
This will run through all the different
comments at once. And so what we do here
is actually use a loop of items which I
can find right here. Loop of items split
in batches. And we tell it, hey, only
send 50 through until and run this whole
thing until here and then send it back.
So, we use this right here to loop it
all back until we get the other 50 and
we get the other 50 and the other 50
until the 505 is finished. This is great
because we're sort of splitting the
automation up into different items so
that the automation can run the first
step. Go back run set amount of items.
In this case, it's 50. It can be 30, can
be 100, 150. Um, but in this case, we
want to keep it at 50 so that AI is
actually able to uh to cover all of
those. All right. So the next hack is
actually within testing AI agents
because whenever you want to test an AI
agent, you assume that you need to have
an input. There has to be an input for
the agent to think through what you just
asked it and then give you an answer
back. But what if I wanted to test only
this part and I didn't want to chat with
it every single time in order for it to
actually run. Well, in this case, let's
say I do hello. You see how now because
of the input, it then does its thing. If
I go here, I can now pin the data. So I
don't have to keep chatting to it every
single time in order for the actual
agent to run. But bear in mind the data
that goes through the input will be the
chat input which is hello. And another
hack that you can do is actually press
this button right here. So you can
manipulate the input. In this case,
let's do how's the weather in row and
save it. So now the input changed and
that's what is going to be fed into the
agent every single time. So if I go
here, I can now only test this step
because this is pinned and I don't have
to chat to it every single time which
makes testing so much easier. The next
hack is actually something that I was
wondering when I was building AI agents
myself because I thought, okay, we we
chat to it on N right here, but what if
I want to activate this to a client,
right? Do I have to always use Telegram
or WhatsApp or Slack, whatever it is?
Can't I just use something inside of
Nitn a link that someone can use for a
chatbot? Well, the answer is yes.
Because if I go here and I go to make
chat publicly available, if I copy this,
and by the way, you have to activate the
scenario first. You have to activate
this. Activate it and I paste this in
the web. Now I can actually chat to the
AI agents. If I say hello,
what it will do is that it will think
through the AI agents. So if I go back
here, I go to executions, I can now see
that we just chatted to it and the input
was hello, right? And and so you can
actually chat to this. So this would be
the link that you share with the client
whenever they have to talk to it or
whenever you have to talk to it as a way
to have a personal assistant without
having to rely on Telegram or Slack or
WhatsApp, whatever it is. So the next
hack is actually being able to connect
an AI agent to another AI agent. So
let's say I go to tool and I go to agent
AI agent tool. I can now see that I have
the possibility to connect the AI agent
to another AI agent right here. Now this
right here is an example of a workflow
an assistant that I build that uses this
exact feature of calling sub agents
within the main agent. Sort of like this
is a CEO of the company and these are
the head of departments and the head of
departments talk to the employees which
actually do the exact task. Now, this is
great because previously we actually had
to make an AI agent somewhere else and
then be able to call it on a different
workflow and then send the data back.
But in this case, we can all do it in
the same place. And again, the way to
set it up is to go to tool, put the AI
agent tool, and then you can simply do
the thing that you do here. You can put
a chat model. In this case, let's do
open AI.
You can do the memory this is here. And
now you connect it to any tool that you
want, right? In this case, it can be
whatever. It can be Gmail here and so
on. And the way to actually know whether
it sends it here is to be able to give
it a prompt to tell it hey only execute
this or this is the data that you're
going to get and do XYZ just like a
general agent would right so the next
hack is actually prompting the AI agent
in a very specific way. So if I go here
I know that every AI agent has a system
message which is a message or prompt
that we tell the AI agent whenever we
want to give it instructions. So
typically the way they would look is we
have overview which is an overview of
what it needs to do. Then we have tools.
And the way the reason why we actually
use these hashtags is to give it a it's
called markdown formatting. So this is
heading two. This is heading one. This
is heading three. In this case, we can
leave it at heading two. And then we
also have rules. It's something that
people don't even put whenever they're
using AI agents. Let's say the AI agent
was connected to a calendar and we say,
"Hey, can you make an event for
tomorrow?" How does it know today's
date? Well, that's the thing about AI
because it doesn't actually remember
today's date. Let me show you. So if I
go here and I have no problem in this
case and I ask it, hey what's today's
date,
you see that it says hey today's date is
April 27, 2024 while today is actually
4th of September 2025. So we know that
AI is actually not the best remembering
dates which is crucial because usually
we have tools like Google calendar or
Gmail and when we have to say different
dates let's say we say hey send a
meeting for tomorrow or schedule a
meeting for next week. We want to be
able for the AI agent to know when
today's date is so that it can
contextualize it when we say tomorrow or
next week, whatever it is. So to
actually fix that, we go here to the
system message. We say today's date.
This is going to be at the end of each
prompt. So we have the overview, we have
the rules, tools, and all that stuff.
And then we say today's date. Then you
put curly bracket curly bracket. You put
an S dollar. And then you put right
here. Now this right here is going to be
fed into the agent every single time as
an extra so that it remembers today's
date. So now if I ask it, hey, what is
today's date?
Because it knows the date, it can say
September 4th, 2025. So this makes a
difference because again when you have
calendar tools, you want to know exactly
when today's date is to be able to
contextualize it for next week or next
month or whatever. All right. So the
next hack is actually using a GBT that
Chris Roberts, I don't know who he is,
uh, but he made a GPT that actually
works pretty well when you want to debug
or need help with automations. Now, I
mentioned that you can go and talk to
the AI right here, the AI assistant,
which pulls from the community, which
pulls from from different places, which
is amazing, but it doesn't actually
solve everything. So, in this case, I
use this GPT. I give it a picture,
whatever it is, some tone of voice, even
if you want to ask it, hey, I want to
build this automation. It actually does
a pretty good job. Now, I'm going to
leave the link down below. Again, this
is not mine. I'm not affiliated with
anything here. I actually genuinely use
this and I think it's actually pretty
good GPT. All right. So, the next hack
is actually within the HTTP request and
the way that we actually set up APIs. So
sometimes when we want to add an app,
let's say I go to on app event and I
want to look for an app but it's not
here. I then have to go to Google and
search up the app name. So the software
name let's say ClickUp and we search up
ClickUp API documentation and we get on
this page. Now this page is an API
documentation is a very follows a very
standard uh way of that it looks we have
different request we have the summary of
the request and then we have something
called a curl. Now this scroll right
here is something that previously we'll
have to manually and paste into the HTTP
request because we have the URL which in
this case is the one here. We have the
headers which is the one here send
headers. Uh and we have the body in this
case which is not here. But now we can
actually copy this and we can go back
here and we can import curl. We can
paste this and we can import it. So then
now we don't have to know exactly where
things have to go at each time. we can
just worry about sending the data that
we actually need to send and not setting
things up on an HTTP request. Now, one
more thing is that a lot of the times
when you have to use a software like
ClickUp or other softwares as well, we
have to use something called an API key.
Now, this is a key that we use to say,
hey, this is my access token. This is my
password. You can access it, right? And
most of the times the way that we
actually use API keys is by adding them
here. So, we do API key and this is not
always standard. And then we have to put
some long code that you know signifies a
password. But in this case, instead of
putting it here every single time here,
you can go to generic credential type,
we then can go to barrier o right here.
And we can create a new credential. In
this case, it can be the actual API key
that you're using right here. And now
you can name it whatever you want. Click
up. Press save. And now you're able to
actually access the API key every single
time or the HTTP request is able to
access the API key here. Uh and whenever
you have to use ClickUp, all you have to
go is here. you can use click up and you
don't have to re add the API key here.
Now the next hack is actually batching.
So a lot of the times when you do a HTTP
request to a server uh the server
actually has limits. So let's say air
table has a limit of I think it was 100
requests per minute or something like
that and the HTTP request sometimes can
go over that. So for us to actually
limit the amount of requests that we
sent to the server per amount of time we
can go down here add options we can go
to batching and now we can add we only
want to send 50 items per this interval.
in this case is 1 second. So 50 items
per 1 second. And so you have to
obviously look at the limit uh the API
limit that the platform has. But this
allows us to be more flexible and
navigate errors because a lot of the
times we know there's errors when we
send too many requests to the to the
actual platform cuz they have a
restriction. In this case we say hey
only send 53 at once every second. And
we can change this. This can be 10 10
million right? Whatever it is that you
want to do and you can change the time
frame and you can change the amount of
items that go through the API request at
each time. All right. So the next hack
is actually within error handling
itself. Uh now let's say we had a
workflow that looked like this. We have
the schedule trigger which runs every 10
seconds and then we have a HTTP request
that we're calling. In this case it's my
website. So if I execute the step this
gives me the whole code. But let's say
now I activated this which runs every 10
seconds. So now it's calling the API
every 10 seconds. And I wanted to let's
say I changed something like this or
added some more stuff here. I press
save. So we can see here that we got an
error because of the fact that again we
put an invalid URL and this does not
work. Now the good thing about error
handling is that we have debug and
editor and we have go back to the same
data before that I showed you. We also
have something called an error workflow.
And this just means that whenever a
workflow stops working because it's an
error, we call we send the data to
another workflow to then do whatever it
needs to do. So let me show you exactly
because it it makes much more sense once
I show you. If I go here to another
workflow, do personal
I can add something called an error
trigger. So this error trigger basically
works so that it receives all the errors
from any workflow that you connect it to
and then it does whatever. So let's say
I do Gmail and I want to send myself an
email whenever I receive an error from
any workflow. Okay, so now I made the
email right here. There was an error in
the workflow. Let me do uh exclamation
mark. Go here. I can press save. Now if
I go back to the original automation I
have to go to settings here. Then I have
to go to error workflow. So to notify
the error. So in this case, let me name
this error. So I know that it is this
workflow right here. And now I can
choose the workflow to send the data to
when it errors. In this case, it will be
error as you can see here. And I press
save. Now let's execute this every 5
seconds.
Let me press save. Let me press active.
So this right here should now when it
executes it's going to error out again
like here. As you can see it errors out
every 5 seconds. If I go here, I can see
on the executions that this was
successful. As in it's getting the data
because it there was an error in the
workflow. If I go to my email, I can now
see that I have a bunch of emails saying
there's an error, there's an error,
there's an error. Now, this is great
because let me actually turn this off
cuz I don't want a bunch of emails here.
This is great when you have different
automations. So, we have a bunch of
automations. Let's say we have 10 or 20
within the workspace. We all connected
this. We all connect all the different
automations to the error trigger so that
we know exactly every single time and it
does the same thing, right? Which is
amazing because then we have everything
centralized and we have everything
within one workflow to be able to notify
us when there's an error. Right? So the
next hack is actually called a human in
the loop. So let's say I had a simple
automation like this. I can go
[clears throat] here. I can go to human
in the loop and this is across multiple
different platforms. So let's say I use
Gmail and I send myself an email and I
execute previous notes. This is an
example or in this case it's an error so
I can't do that but uh say hello is this
hello how's it going let's say I pull
something from before previous step and
then we have the response tag which is
essentially saying hey when I send you
the email for you to to check or
something submit something do you want
it to be an approval so you can approve
or disapprove you want to be free text
so you can actually give me feedback or
do you want it to be a custom form so in
this case let's do approval let's say I
already sent the
I can get this and I can approve right
here. Now, this sends the data back
right here and we got the approval,
right? Approved equals true. And now,
this is great in case you're building
automations like these. Uh, and by the
way, this is a human in the loop AI
sales agent that basically starts with
the form, right? Let me execute it
actually to show you uh which has
different fields. So, James, email,
company name, intent, budget, project
description, timeline. Then we talk to
we add it to the sheet. We talk to the
sales agent to make a sales email which
then is being sent to us for us to say,
"Hey, approve or deny or actually get
feedback. Then when we give it feedback,
the text classifier classifies whether
this is good feedback or bad feedback."
If it's negative, then it uses feedback
to rewrite the email. And it goes
through the whole thing over and over
again until we give it a positive
feedback saying, "Hey, all good." And
then actually sends the email to the
lead.
Hey, so in this video I'm going to show
you exactly how you can set up your own
Google credentials. So you can connect
Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Docs to
Nitn and get going right away. Let's
dive in. All right, so if I go to NN
right here, I can see that if I go to
Google Sheets and I want to connect my
Google Sheets to NN, I can see that I
can simply just sign in with Google. If
I press this button, it will take me to
this page. I can choose an account. I
will then press continue and the
connection is successful. Now this is
great because NN previously did not have
this, but now they implemented this. So
you only have to sign in with Google.
This is the same exact case when you
want to sign in with Gmail. You want to
go here, create a new credential and you
can sign in with Google. This is the
exact same process and it's amazing
because it allows us to not have to do
any authorization or anything like that.
We just have to press the button, choose
the account and that's it. But now if I
go to Google Drive right here, I can see
that I want to press create a new
credential. I have to add the client ID
and client secret. So how is it that we
have to do this? And if I go to Google
Docs, you can see that it's pretty much
the same. So if I go here, creating a
credential, I have to add the client ID
and client secret as well. So in order
for us to generate the client ID and
client secret, let me go here. I have to
go to the documentation.
I have to scroll down. The first step is
create a Google Cloud Console project.
So I have to go log into Google Console
Cloud or Google Cloud Console. I have to
go right here on the top and I have to
press new project.
You want to name the projects. In this
case, we can name it Google off
tutorial.
There it is. Going to press create. And
now the project is actually creating for
you. I'm going to press right here.
Select project. And you know that you're
in the right project when on the top
left you can see that Google all
tutorial. Now the first thing you want
to do, you want to go to API and
services.
And you want to search up for the apps
for the software that you actually want
to connect your automations to. So in
this case, if I go back to NN, I can see
that I want to connect to my Google
Drive, but also my Google Docs. The
first step I have to do is search up
Google Drive,
Google Drive API, and I want to enable
this. This is saying, hey, let's enable
the API so we can use it in the
automation.
All right, cool. So you get to the
screen and we want to do the exact same
for Google Docs.
Press Google Docs.
Google Docs API. I press here.
And you want to enable this.
Amazing. So now that we have both APIs
enabled, all we have to do is go to OOTH
consent screen.
We have to get started.
Put the app name. So let's do test and
it's end user support email. This will
be your email. Next, you can put
external which is fine. The email
address. Put your email address. Put
mine.
Next. Agree. Continue and create. All
right. So once this is done we can go
here the create oath client.
This will take us to this page and we
can choose the application. In this case
it can be web application. Then client
can be let's do color test.
Now it's asking us for two different
things. It's asking us do we want to add
an authorized JavaScript origins or
authorize zirec. So this right here we
leave blank but if I go back to I can
see that they said in Google drive use
the URL above when prompted to enter an
ooth call back or redirect URL. So what
we want to do here is you want to copy
this URL. Go back to the off client ID
and you want to add it to the authorized
redirect URLs. Press add URLs. Want to
paste this and you want to press create.
Once this is done, we have the client
ID. Make sure to not share the client
with anyone because this is
confidential. Going to press this copy.
Go back. Paste it here. And now we have
the client ID. To get the client secret,
all we have to do is go back here. Press
okay. want to go here to test and the
client secret will be this one right
here client secret I'm going to copy
this you want to now go here client
secret you'll see the option to sign in
with Google so let's say I sign in with
Google this will give me this option I
can press the account that I have but
now it will block me access blocked and
then cloud does not have complete Google
verification process so once we get this
we know that we have to publish the app
so to do this I can go to audience I can
go to publish app confirm
Now the app is published. So we can then
go back to an event.
Sign in with Google.
Choose the account. It will send me to
this page. I can go to advanced right
here.
I can go to nan.cloud.
And now I can select all the different
things that we want to do. In this case
is edit, view and create. I can
continue. And the connection is
successful. I can see that the
connection is created. go here select
connection
now I can press save
if I go here let's say I want to create
a file from text but let's say I say
hello
I press execute step I can see that now
the connection was successful I go back
to Google docs to pretty much do the
same thing so in this case I can create
a new credential go here we can go to
clients you have a test where actually
we can copy the client ID from here so
copy this paste it here.
Go back. Go to the software or the
account. In this case, you can copy the
client secret again and you can paste
this. Now we can sign with Google
and go here.
Advanced. Go to end.cloud.
Select the different things you want to
do. Continue.
And the connection is successful. We go
back. I can name it. Save. Now, if I
want to, let's say, create a document.
My drive folder name is invoice in and I
press CSU hello. I can go to execute
step. Now the step is executed and we
can see that everything works fine. So
far you've built a solid foundation. You
know exactly how to connect apps, how
automations actually work, how to use
web hooks and how to clean up data. But
automations can only get you so far. The
real magic is when you build automations
and pair them up with AI. So in the next
module we'll dive into the hottest topic
of niten which is AI agency. You learn
exactly what they are, how you can use
them, what is the difference between an
AI agent and a workflow, and finally,
how you can start building it from
scratch inside of an end. And this is
where your automation doesn't just turn
into a simple workflow, but turns into a
virtual employee. With that being said,
let's dive in.
If you're someone who's been finally
want to understand AI agents, but you're
getting lost in all the technical terms
and you're getting way too overwhelmed,
well, this video is for you because I'm
going to be breaking down the
fundamentals of AI agents as if I'm
teaching it to a 5-year-old [music] so
you finally understand what this whole
hype is about. All right, so we're going
to cover the fundamentals of AI agents
and the different types of AI agents.
And by the way, if you want to see the
difference between AI agents and
workflows, check out this video up here.
Um, but this is the simplistic version
of what an AI agent does. We have an
input and we have an output. Between the
input and the output, there's an agent.
There's someone who is prompted with
instructions. So, he has instructions
saying, "Hey, you have to do XYZ if this
happens." And the AI agent, so the
actual thing, the the boss uh which has
instructions is connected to its brain
and its brain is AI. So, Chad GBT or
Claude or Gemini and it has a memory
because as a normal human, you remember
the previous conversations. So, you have
this context and then it has tools. So
these are the different things that it
uses to take action on something. So in
this case, let's do an example. If the
input is send an email, what it will do
is that it will think through all the
system prompt instructions that it was
given saying, hey, if the user says send
an email, then call then use the tool
which is Gmail. And that's how the logic
usually goes. And so if you have
multiple tools, then the AI agent is
able to take actions on multiple
softwares, which means that it has
actions. It can send emails. It could
also schedule calendar events. You can
get calendar events. It all depends on
the different tools that you connect it
to the AI agent. Then now it's able to
take action. Okay. So input send
something or do something whatever it
is. Agent will think through what it
needs to do with its brain which is try
to be or claw or whatever it is. It
remembers the conversation and then it
takes action on what we told it to do
based on the tool that is connected to
and then it will give us the output
which is yep everything was good. You're
good to go. And a beautiful thing about
this is that one AI agent can be
connected to five to 10 different tools.
So one input can lead in a series of
outputs. It can lead to multiple actions
in multiple softwares. Now what does an
AI agent actually look like? We're going
to use N10 as an example just because it
is the the widely known AI agent uh
feature. But the way that it looks like
is we have a chat which is the input. So
this is a thing that goes into the AI
agent. In this case you can chat to it
using the native N10 chat node which
looks like this. You can say hello,
right? Um, you can also use telegram.
Telegram is sort of like a like a
WhatsApp. You can use Gmail. So, it can
send conversations to the agent using
email. And now the information will pass
through all the way to the AI agent. So,
this line means that the information
goes through to here. Now, this is where
the agent is prompted. So, if I go in
here, this AI agent is consisted of
three different things. The first one is
the source for prompt. So prompt is
basically saying hey what is the thing
that we're actually giving the AI agent
for it to do right what is what is the
thing what is the input what is a chat
what is the email and so we connect this
so we say connected chat trigger node
because currently the AI agent is
connected to the chat trigger node this
is what this called and then prompt user
message which is what is the thing
that's going inside in this case it
would be the JSON uh chat input because
this is the thing that's going through
here let me show you an example let me
disconnect connect this.
There we go. Let me go here. Let me say
hello. And now the information will pass
through to here. Now it gave us an error
because this AI agent must be connected
to an AI in order to think through. But
you can now see that the chat input
which is this one is hello is the input
that we give it. Now the second thing
here is the system message. So the
system message is the instructions that
we give it. So, sort of like you have an
employee and you tell the employee, hey,
if this happens, call this. If that
happens, call this. You're training them
on what they're meant to do. Now,
usually when it comes to the prompts or
the the instructions that we give to the
AI agent, it consists of an overview.
So, saying here are a helpful
intelligent XYZ assistant that does XYZ.
And then the tools. Now, the tools you
basically explain the different
softwares that are connected to the AI
agent. So it has context as to what it
can do, what tool it can do, what
software it can uh it can take action on
based on the ones that are connected to
it. And then we have rules which are
different rules. So it can be when a
task requires using one or more tools,
make sure to identify which tool is the
most appropriate, pass along the
relevant details and execute the actions
needed to complete the task. So these
are different rules that we tell the AI
agent to make sure that the quality of
output is increasing because sometimes
with the fact that it's AI, it can
hallucinate. can make up some stuff. It
can do its own thing. And we basically
want to restrict it to doing only the
things that we want it to do. So again,
we have overview tools and rules. And
then we also give it the date and time
because let's say we tell it, hey, can
you tell John that we have a meeting
tomorrow? Well, the thing about AI is
that it's not the best at remembering
dates. So we always want to give it a
date, which in this case you can simply
do by putting curly bracket and then put
now, right? So now we'll give it today's
date. And then we format it in a way
where it looks like this. Right, which
is good. And now the AI agent will
always have a dynamic variable. So it
will always have this which changes
every single day based on what day it
is. And it uses that as context when
taking the action that it needs to take.
Now obviously this is not used always
but when it makes a calendar event when
it sends an email asking for a specific
time uh this is very very useful. So
again we have the chat input and then we
have the system prompt which is the
instructions that we give to the AI
agent when it needs to take action on
something. Then [snorts] we have the LLM
plus memory. The chat model here is the
brain of the agent. Now I can connect
this to the model, right? So this is the
um the line that allows the AI agent to
then pass through the input to its brain
using its instructions and actually
think. And in order for us to actually
connect the AI agent to OpenAI, all we
have to do is go here, create a new
credential, and you want to go to
platform.opai.com,
login. You can go to dashboard. You can
go to API keys. And we're basically
making a password that N10 AI agents can
use when actually thinking through its
LLM. LM just means chbt or cloud. Uh in
actually thinking through the
instructions. So you can press this
button. You can say AI agent create a
secret key and make sure to copy this
which will then paste right here. And
you can call this yeah agent test
3rd October. Press save. And bear in
mind that this is not free. So you would
have to go to your profile and you would
have to go to billing uh right here and
make sure to add some money because AI
requires you to have credits and credits
require money. Uh but it is very very
cheap when we're talking about a few few
cents per execution. All right. So now
that we connected AI, we have Chad GBT
as the brain. All we have to do now is
connect the model, right? So, we're
choosing the model that the AI agent
uses when it's thinking through what it
needs to do. So, now that we have AI
connected to it, let's actually chat to
it. Let's say hello. And now what you
can see is that the input went here.
What it did is that it automatically
talked to its brain, which in this case
it's OpenAI. And then it gave us an
answer. So, the answer in this case is
hello, how can I assist you? And this is
as if we're talking to the actual chatbt
interface on chatbt, but we're
connecting it using the API version. So
the automatic version. Now we have
memory. Now memory right here is when
the AI agent when you want the AI agent
to remember previous steps or
conversations uh when you're doing
something. So this is useful when you're
basically creating a drafting email to
John and then um the AI agent already
knows who John is and then you say, can
you also schedule a calendar event? So
now it has context as to who John is to
then be able to take the next action
without you having to state who John is
in the first place. But on a simple term
I can say hello how are you?
And now I can also ask it what did I
just
ask you? If I ask this I can now get the
answer which is probably hello how are
you? Uh you asked me hello how are you?
How can I assist you today? Now as you
can see here the logs these are the
different steps that the AI agent took
in order to get to the output. Right?
All right. So in this case what it did
is that the AI agent went through the
simple memory. So it remembered uh
exactly the conversation that it had
using the context. Then it uses AI to
think through its uh instructions and
then what it did is that it used the
memory tool again to give us the actual
answer. All right. So now that we have
the LM connected to this end the memory
this tool right here. So this is how the
AI agent actually takes action and we
can connect this to Gmail and calendar.
And inside the Gmail, we set a series of
instructions and different details to
allow the AI to define what the subject
line is, what the message is, and who
are we sending the email to. And same
thing with the calendar. This is going
to be another tool that the AI agent has
access to in order to take actions for
us. And we give it the before and after
of the event that we want to schedule or
in this case, we want to get the event.
Um, and now if I speak to the AI agent,
this is prompted, if I go here, this is
prompted with the two different tools.
So, Gmail will be used to draft an
email. Uh, calendar will be used to get
calendar events, right? So, it knows
exactly when to use each tool. And when
I say, hey, can you send an email?
This should now send back or should ask
me who are we sending the email to. So,
I say, hey, I can help you draft an
email. Can you provide me with the
details of the email such as the
recipient email address, a subject line,
and the message you'd like to include.
So I said send an email to
mik.torgmail.com
saying we have dinner tomorrow.
What this will now do is that it will
take action on the draft. As you can
see, it just called the tool. So just
send a signal to the tool saying, hey, I
just got received instructions to do
XYZ. Can you do it? As you can see, we
went through step by step right here.
And now it says we have drafted the
email to Mik. So if I go to my email
right here, I can see in the draws that
we have dinner tomorrow to this person
right here. Obviously, you can improve
the prompt to make the email actually
more contextual or uh I guess more sauce
in the email. But just know that it
called the exact tool that we wanted to
call to take the action that we wanted
to take, right? Without us having to go
to the Gmail tool. And it did it within
seconds. Now for my calendar, let's do
an event um lunch and let's do dinner,
right? We have one on Friday and one on
Sunday. If I go to any 10, let me ask
it, can you grab the events from this
week, please? What this will now do is
it will go here. It will think through
what it needs to do. It will then call
the appropriate tool to then give us an
answer back, which should give us lunch
and dinner. Um, as you can see here, we
have Q&A with Shaz, which is something
that I did before. Lunch and dinner as
well because these were the three
events. We have Q&A with Shaz, lunch,
and dinner. And that's how fundamentally
a simple version of an AI agent looks
like. It's connected to an input. It
think through its LLM uh because that's
how it's its brain works. It it
remembers the conversations and it takes
action on the the things that we wanted
to do using different softwares. Now,
this is called a simple AI agent. Now,
we can get on to the multi-step AI
agent. So, this is an AI agent that is
connected to more AI agents and more
tools, right? As you can see, it's more
complex than just a simple walkthrough.
And by the way, if you want to see the
full walkthrough of this AI agent, check
out this video up here. But essentially,
the way that this works is that we have
an input and we have an output. This is
always the case with AI agents. It
doesn't change. Now, the only difference
here is that we still have the system
prompt instruction. This is still the
exact same. It still has a brain, which
is LM. It still has a memory, but the
only um change is that we're not calling
tools as a first step. We're calling
other agents in the first step. So
fundamentally this is why because the
most important thing here that matters
it's not so much the tools it's the
prompt that we give the AI agents
because the prompt is the instructions
[music] and so if we instruct an AI
agent to take action on 55 different
tools like these well the chances that
it would actually succeed are pretty low
even though we have the best prim in the
world because of the fact that um it be
non-deterministic right it can fail
right because it's AI and so what we do
here is you want minimize the failure
rate of an AI agent. So what we do is we
add more AI agents. And so the way to
think about this use case is as if you
have a company. So a company right will
be the customer which is the input. It
then tells the the CEO hey can you can
you maybe check the finances that we
have in our company. And now the CEO is
presented with head of departments. So
in this case we have the head of
calendar, head of email, head of blogs
and head of contacts.
and the head of contacts and blog and
email and calendar have access to tools
which are employees, right? And so why
do we have head of departments and not
just have employees connected to the
CEO? Because if a CEO had access to a
100 employees and he was given a task
from his client, it would be hard for
him to know exactly who to assign it to.
He would get it wrong most of the time
or some of the time. And so when we want
to minimize errors, we want to assign a
head of department for that specific
role and let him figure out who to give
it only for the employees in his
department, right? So the tools are only
connected to the calendar agent for the
calendar tools. Same thing with emails,
blogs and and contact as well. And so
what ends up happening here is that we
have a big Agent and all of these are
subset of this. So this is one which is
the same thing as this. This is one
which is same thing as this. This and
this as well. The only difference is
that the memory is only connected to the
main AI agent. And so here we have
telegram which is the input. So we can
give it a voice message or even a text.
All right. So here we have telegram
which is the input and we have the whole
AI agent. And let's say now I wanted to
uh send an email and schedule a calendar
event.
As you can see, we also have the contact
agent, which in this case, we instruct
the main agent to always look at the
contact agent before sending the email
and before making the calendar event
because this contains the detail of the
person that we're doing all of this for.
And as you can see here, the contact
database consists of Michael James, John
Lori, and James Low. So, we can first
run this. So, now it's waiting for the
messages to come through. And now with
Telegram, we can say, "Send an email to
Michael James, uh, telling him that we
have dinner tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. And
can you also put that on the calendar
and invite him as well?" Um, yeah,
that's it. All right. So, now we give it
an input. Let's press enter. What this
will now do is it will then go to the AI
agent. It will then talk to the contact
agent because we instructed to use the
contact agent first before doing
anything else. And now it will take
action on the email. As you can see, it
used this tool which send an email. And
then it sent it to calendar agent at the
same time to create an event. Now, if I
go to my email right here, I can see
that I have dinner tomorrow. We have
dinner tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. And in my
calendar, I can see that I should have
dinner with Michael James at 4:00 to
5:00 p.m. And it also invited his email
as well, which is nuts. So, why is this
any different from the previous one?
Well, this is a very very simplistic
version of an AI agent, whilst this is
more advanced. It has more features and
it breaks down the different steps step
by step. Right? As I mentioned, we have
the CEO and we have the head of
departments and the head of departments
are connected to different tools and
these tools are employees, right?
Instead of giving all the employees and
hooking them all up to this tool because
then it will overwhelm the AI agent. It
has way too many options. The prompt
will be way too big. And so we basically
want to construct it or deconstruct it
and break it apart for it to actually
have room for thinking when it's taking
the action that it needs to take. And so
this is really really powerful because
just by having this one input, it can
lead to what over over 10 12 actions,
right? Which is nuts. Which is why AI
agents are really really powerful when
you want to have something that's
autonomous. That's why they say it's
your virtual employee because your
virtual employee in this case is
connected to different tools which are
different actions and it can do
different things for you. But bear in
mind that if you want the AI agent to do
more things than you have right now,
then you have to connect it to more
tools and more softwares, right? And
what I always think about when I'm
building AI agents is that we never want
to overwhelm the the AI agent, right?
Because if you give it a prompt that's
super super long, it's still AI, right?
Like there's no 100% fact or no 100% um
guarantee that it will always do the
same thing. And which is great, which is
fine when you're testing, but when
you're putting it into an actual
business, like the margin for error
needs to be very, very, very I'm talking
like 0.00001%
[music] chance it fails. Uh because it's
in production mode, businesses need to
actually operate. And so you don't want
something that sometimes work, that most
times works. You want something that
pretty much all the time works. By
pretty much, I mean like 99.99% of the
time works. Um but there's still
obviously that that thing of like AI not
being able to do everything, right? But
it's great that we can now chat to it
and it can now take action on everything
that we want. So this right here is the
fundamentals of AI agents. Let me show
you another example of AI agents and
where these can come from. I can simply
go to chat GBT and I can just search up
Asian mode. So agents are pretty much
everywhere because a lot of these
software tools, they're implementing
these sort of autonomous systems where
you can just say, can you go to Google
and find the top five marketing agencies
in Ontario, Canada? And just by this
prompt right here, what it does is that
it thinks through. So it thinks through
the actual task and then it takes action
on the thing that we told it to do. So
now it's thinking which is the exact
same with any as in it has a brain that
it thinks through. So as you can see now
it's cross-checking it's doing a ton of
research uh for us and a good thing is
that we can see it live what it's doing
which is amazing. And one step above
this is I can actually take actions on
our softwares. [music] So this right
here is obviously going to Google on its
own but we can say hey go to my notion
and create a task or go here and do
something else. All right. As you can
see here we got the different agencies
the location the key specialties and the
evidence as well with all the different
sources.
and a summary as well which is crazy as
in we gave it a simple prompt. Can you
go to Google and find the top product
marketing agencies in Ontario Canada
this is something that you give to an
employee and it just did it for 2
minutes and it did a ton of research as
well. So that's exactly why AI agents
are so powerful because whether it's
Chad GBT, whether it's and AI agents,
whether it's relevance, whether it's
lovable, whether it's Gemini canvas,
right? Like we all have different uh the
AI agent fundamentals don't change. They
don't change because they all have an
input. They all have an output. And the
middle part is the thing that really
drives the value because it takes action
on us without us having to be so
explicit with the instructions or the
input that we give it. If you're
enjoying this course so far, then you're
going to love the community that we have
right here, which is the AI Automation
Circle. is a space with over 3,000
individuals or legends looking to learn
AI automations from zero either to apply
it in their own business or start
selling it to businesses or start their
AI automation agency. People introduce
themselves every single day. They ask
questions, they share wins. We have
unlimited tech support. We have all the
YouTube resources and people looking for
jobs and partnerships. And if I go to
classroom, we also have a AI automations
101 course, which is a mini course on AI
automations, very similar to this one,
but that dives deeper into more
frameworks that we use when we're
applying automations to businesses. We
have Templates Vault, which is a library
of all the different automations that
we've built so far on YouTube, as well
as the blueprints as well. We have
weekly recordings because we have two
calls a week, and you have all the
recordings here. And you also have over
$20,000 in discounts with softwares
across no code automations, across
project management, across AI tools,
across marketing, LLM, and other tools
as well. As I said, you have two calls a
week. And our members are spread out
everywhere in the world, which is
literally awesome to see. If you want to
join, check the second link down below.
So, in this video, I'm going to show you
step by step everything that you need to
know about building your first AI agent
on NN. So today, you're not just
watching me build it, but I'm walking
you through my thinking, showing you the
shortcuts and the mistakes. So by the
end, you'll be able to build your own AI
agent with confidence. Let's dive in.
All right. So before we get to the
actual build and showing you an end on a
high level, what an AI agent is
something that has an input and has an
output. In between the input and the
output, it does a series of actions. So
for example, the input could be can you
draft an email, right? You send that
input over to the AI agent which has
instructions has a system prompt and
based on what you tell it. So let's say
draft an email like I mentioned it
consults with the brain and LLM based on
the instructions it was given like hey
he just told me to draft an email um
what do we do and then based on the
instructions and based on what it has to
do. So for example if he says draft an
email then talk to Gmail. If he says
check all the calendar events talk to
Google calendar right based on the
obviously the instruction was given it
will then talk to the tools. It will
send a request to the right tool that it
needs. In this case, it will be Gmail if
it has to be dropped an email. So, it
will send the request to tools to Gmail
and then from the Gmail it will get a
response which would be like hey 200
which means successful. And it will then
give us the output which is hey it was
all good it was drafted. Check your
inbox or whatever right? So input output
uh system prompts instructions that we
tell it every single time like hey if
this happens do this if that happens do
that. Brain LLM is essentially what the
AI agent is using to think right the
open AAI or claude whatever it is and
then the memory itself basically is
important because it actually remembers
the previous questions that we asked it.
So let's say the first question is how
are you and then we ask it hey uh can
you draft an email for me on the third
try we ask it hey what did I ask you on
the first on the first question it will
remember because it has a context window
that's what we call it that's what the
memory is so input is hey can you do
this AI even thinks through the
instruction that we will give it through
the system prompt it will then talk to
the AI because that's how it thinks
that's it brain and then it will use any
tool that is connected to it that it
needs to use for that specific task it
also has a context window and it will
give us the output okay so that's on a
high level what an AI agent is so The
first step to building an AI agent is
going to NN and pressing sign in. You'll
have to make an account. There is a free
account, but I believe it's 14 days free
trial. So, after 14 days, you're going
to have to pay. That's the way that I
have set up. Not really a big fan. Not
sure about Zaper. Mic.com definitely has
a free plan to start, but um N right
here. It will come to this page when you
sign up. All you have to do is press
open instance and you'll come to this
page right here. Now, this page is
essentially the dashboard of N. This is
what N looks like. Uh right here on the
left hand side, you get to see home,
personal, which is in case you want to
divide different things in different
folders. Uh you have your different
automations here, credentials,
executions. Uh these are some different
metrics that they track. Um just so you
know exactly what you're doing within
your workspace. And then right here,
this is where you want to press create
workflow because this is the canvas for
and this is where everything starts. The
automation starts here. On [snorts] the
down hand side, we have this right here
where we can basically move the
automation around. We have zoom, we have
um zoom out, we have go back, we have
basically if the automation is here, it
brings it all back to the center. So
that's what this button does. tidy tidy
up right here which also has keyboard
shortcuts. Then we go to editor right
here which is where you can edit the
automation executions where you can see
all the different executions that you've
done. So execution just means you run
the automation from start to the end you
can see all the executions here. And
then evaluations is just for some
testing. I don't use it that much so
don't really worry about that. Then you
have this button right here where if you
toggle this on it will activate the
automation. And what it means is that
when you build an automation from start
to the end um you can activate it so you
don't have to run it once every single
time. Right? production it happens every
single time without you having to go to
NN [clears throat] then share you can
share save you can save the automation
then right here you can actually
download the automation and you can
import from file so let's say I download
this automation I then give it to you
and you import it into your own NN you
will have the automation done for you
don't have to worry about it so that's
how automations NN workflows really work
then right here you can see that you
have plus which is basically where you
can add the different steps to the
automation then we have this right here
which is add sticky notes in case you
want to add sticky notes right here and
you want to sort of walk you through
that's good for documentation in case
you're building an automation you want
to explain to someone who hasn't really
seen the automation how it works you can
just put sticky notes here and then here
you can have the side panel and then
here you also have the AI assistant
which is one of the best that I've seen
so far within N&N um and it actually
answers most of the technical questions
that you have all right cool so now that
we got through all that part let's start
with adding the first step so this right
here is a node right this square right
here is a node when we press on this
node we get this panel right here now in
order For us to build an an agent, we
ideally want to talk to the agent
itself, right? We want to chat with it.
So the trigger basically means what's
that first thing that actually starts
the workflow like what is that thing
that activates that starts everything.
So in this case we can trigger manually
which means that you can let's say we go
here we can execute workflow which means
that it starts the automation and this
just executes the automation starts the
automation from scratch but this isn't
really best for us when using an AI
agent because we have to trigger
manually every single time. Then we have
on app event on a schedule which means
you can run it every day or every hour.
This is based on apps. Then we have a
web hook here which is where you can use
web hooks to get notified. We can use a
form we can use when executed by another
workflow and then we can have chat
message when running evaluation and
other ways as well. Now for AI agent
specifically we're going to use on chat
message which means I can actually talk
to the AI agent itself. So let's say I
open the chat I can then start talking.
This is basically what's going to start
the automation. So let's say I put hello
it will start the automation. So the
node executed successfully. This means
that everything was good. And you can
see the green mark which means that
everything was good. All right. So in
order for us to then connect this chat
message because ideally we want to talk
to the AI agent. We don't just want to
talk to any end right? We want something
out of it. We want to press plus and
then we have different options here. Now
the options are AI which is what we're
going to use action and app. So you can
actually scroll through all the apps
here and you can add any apps here. data
transformation flow core human in the
loop add another trigger which are cool
things that you actually can use but for
the sake of this video and AI agents
we're not going to go into that but
let's say we press AI we then have
different options we want to press AI
agent now you can simply talk to
anthropic which is claude you can talk
to open AI individually or Gemini but
for this case the AI agent uh node is
exactly what we want so when you press
the AI agent node uh which is obviously
the node is just a square this thing
will come up now the way that end is
actually set up which is probably one of
the platforms that I've seen they have
the input here which is the steps from
the previous so the variables or the
things the output from the previous step
then here so this is the input then we
have here the configuration of the AI
agent this is how we set everything up
and then here is the output so what is
the output of the AI agent so going here
we have again by the diagram that I
showed you at the start you have three
different things that you have to
connect the AI agent to the first one is
a chat model so what chat model so in
this case what LLM openai claw whatever
it is uh do you want to connect the AI
agents
What memory do you want to connect it to
and what tools do you want to connect it
to? So in this case for chat model I can
just press plus. I can then have a
choice of few a few chat models. In this
case we just go safe with openi. So I
can go here openaii chat model. You'll
have this page. All you have to do to
actually connect the openi chat model is
go here to credentials create a new
credential. Now in order for us to
actually connect openai to nn we need an
API key. Now API keys API stands for
application programming interface. It's
the way that a lot of softwares talk to
each other or how softwares talk to each
other. Uh and the key itself allows us
to authorize that this is our account
and we can actually use it. So in order
for us to get the API key, all we have
to do is open a doc. So you can simply
talk to the the AI set in NN. But in
this case, we can just press open docs.
This will open the uh documentation for
NN which is where we can look at this.
Now it says refer to the OpenAI API
documentation uh API keys create. Okay.
So all you have to do is log into openai
account which is essentially
platform.openai.com.
You'll have to make an account. So sign
in with Google. And by the way, just
because you pay for Chad GBT does not
mean that you can use this different
things, right? Different things. One is
for the web and one is for APIs. So once
you log in, you'll have you'll come on
this page. All you have to go to is
dashboard. On the left hand side, you
have to go to API keys. And this is
where we can create a secret key. So go
here. Let's do test YouTube.
And I can create a key. So leave this
all here. Owned by me. All restrictions.
Project is fine. Let's create a secret
key. I want to copy it
and then paste it in edit end right
here. Paste it here. And if I press
save, this will save it. Right.
Connection tested successfully. So now
the open AI is actually connected to
this. Now for the model itself, I want
to leave this to GPT 4.1. You can use a
bunch of models. Now bear in mind that
not all models work with AI agents. They
might work with a normal AI node that
you can use AI in the process for a
workflow. But for AI agents, not all of
them work. So in this case, leave this
as GPT41 mini. Uh and then we go out.
Okay. So in this case now, we connected
the open AI chat models to the AI agent.
And then we go down to memory. Now
memory is basically saying what memory
do you want to implement in the AI agent
so that it remembers the conversation
that we're having. So if I press simple
memory right here, you'll have you'll
come on this page and you have the
session ID which just leave this as this
because we want it to connect to the
chat trigger node. uh the session key
from previous node. Leave this as is. We
don't need to modify this. I mean, we
can't in the first place. And then it's
asking us for the context window length.
Now, the context window length just
means how many past interactions does
the model receive as context. Now, what
does this actually mean? Let's say we
say hello and then it says hello, how
are you? Good. That's four different uh
interactions that we've had, right? So,
four different things, four different
messages as a total. So you want to make
sure that the context window is a bit
larger in in cases where you want the AI
to actually remember the previous
conversation in case you want to change
some things. Um so that's what the
context window length is for. Now I want
to leave this at five just to keep it
simple. Again don't change any of these.
Just put five here and that's all good.
And now the AI agent can actually have a
memory. And then we have tools itself.
Now tools are essentially softwarees
that we connect to the AI agent. So when
we say draft an email, it will go to the
software and actually do it. but it
needs to be connected to the software in
the first place. So for today, let's uh
let's make an AI agent that can draft an
email and that can get calendar events.
I think that's the pretty the most
straightforward one. So all we have to
do to connect the tool is first for
email, we have to connect Gmail and for
calendar we have to connect Google
calendar. So we press and now it's going
to ask us to do different things. In
this case we just want to connect it to
other tools. So in this case we have a
lot of integrations, a lot of softwares.
We can see we have Asana, Apify, Claude,
Air Table. In this case, the search for
Gmail and we have Gmail tool. When we
get to the Gmail tool, this is how you
connect Gmail to NN. I go here and I can
press create a new credential. When I
press create a new credential, it's
very, very straightforward. It used to
be harder before. All you have to do now
is actually just sign in with Google.
When you sign in with Google, it will
take you to this page right here. You
can choose which one you want. In this
case, let's just do this one right here,
my work email. It will say connection
successful. Now we can go back to NN and
we can see that the account was
connected. Now name it whatever you want
and that's the name there and you can
save it. Okay, that's how you connect
your Gmail to NN. So once you have this
you can then put tool description as set
automatically. That's fine. Then
resource let's just put draft because
you want to draft an email not actually
send the email. And then for operation
we can put create. That's fine cuz
you're creating a draft. And then for
the subject and the message which just
means subject of the email and a message
of the email. we can press this little
button right here which means that we
let the model define different pattern.
So we let the model say hey based on
what you've given me using AI this is
exactly what the subject line is going
to be. So in this case I just put this
button right here which means that it
will be defined automatically by the
model and also this button right here.
So that way when I tell it to drop the
email I don't have to tell it exactly
what the subject line needs to be and I
don't have to tell it what the message
needs to be. Right? Everything is just
straightforward. It does it on its own
based on the context that we give. Okay,
cool. And then leave this as text. Uh
you can use HTML which is just a way to
make the emails fancy. Um and that's
fine. And then here I think yeah we have
to add two email. So two email
essentially who are we sending the email
to that we're drafting. So in this case
you also want to put this right here.
Let the model define the parameter
because the AI agent actually decides or
knows the email or it's going to ask us
the email that we need to draft the
email for. Uh so it will add it here as
well. And then we want to put create a
drafting Gmail. That's fine. All right.
Cool. So now we connected Gmail to the
AI agent. Now let's do calendar. So go
here, press plus and look for Google
calendar,
Google calendar tool to connect it. I
already connected. You can see
everything. Uh but in this case, let's
just put create a new credential, sign
in with Google again. Do the same thing
we did for Gmail and it'll bring it all
back. You can close it, I think. Yeah,
close it. All right. So now that we
connected our account, all we have to do
is set this automatically, which is
fine. The resource will be event. Uh the
operation will be get many because we're
getting many events. You can see here
you can retrieve many events from a
calendar which is exactly what we need.
Uh the calendar which is mine which is
fine. The limit will be 50. So 50 events
can be um retrieved at the same time.
And then it's asking us what is the time
frame before and after in this case
because it's not fixed. We just want AI
wouldn't let the model define this. So
based on what we tell it so let's say we
tell it tomorrow. It will know that it's
after yesterday. Um so after today,
sorry, after today, then before tomorrow
or before in 2 days, right? Um that's
like the time frame between each one. So
that's that's the thing we want to let
the model do. All right. So that right
there is how you connected the different
tools to the agent. So we have the chat
model, we have the memory, we have the
tools, and now on to probably the most
important part is the actual prompt, the
system instructions that we tell the AI
agent. So if you go here, we have to add
an option which is the system message.
So the system message is essentially I
mean like this example, we're telling
the AI agent what it needs to do. So for
the system message I actually have a
structure that I use every single time
which is this right here. First we say
you are a identity. So you are a helpful
intelligent assistant AI agent designed
to handle various tasks efficiently.
Your primary role is to task. So to do
the different tasks that we have in this
case is draft an email and get calendar
events. You have access to how many
number of tools? In this case is two to
help you fulfill um requests. The first
tool is draft an email. So what what
does it do? In this case it will drop an
email. Second tool is calendar. In this
case, we have to get calendar events.
And then you say, when a task requires
you to use one of more tools, make sure
to identify which tool is most
appropriate. Pass along the relevant
details and execute the actions needed
to complete the task. Your goal is to be
proactive, precise, and organized in
managing these resources to provide a
smooth experience for the user. And then
we say, here is the current date and
time. Now, why do we say this? We say
the date and time for today because AI
is actually not the best at guessing
what date it is today. So, we always
want to put this especially when you're
including any uh any times into your
emails or any times into the calendar
because if we say tomorrow, usually it
might mess up in knowing what today is,
right? So, definitely we'll get tomorrow
wrong. All right. So, this is the prompt
that we have. Let's copy this. And by
the way, I left all the resources down
below. So, you can copy this. I'm going
to go to NN and then I'm going to delete
this. I'm going to paste this. And I'm
going to press this button right here,
which basically puts everything um on a
wider scale so I can actually see it.
All right. So we have identity. So you
are a helpful
intelligent
intelligent executive assistant. Now AI
agent design tasks. Your primary role is
to let's delete this and put
draft emails and get calendar events.
You have access to two tools
and then first tool is Gmail.
Explanation is Gmail will be used to
draft an email.
First step is identifying
what email we are
drafting the email to.
then understanding
the context
of the email
and then actually dropping it. And then
second tool will be the calendar
which will be
uh this tool
will be used to get calendar events
for any given time frame.
First
understand
what the time frame is and then
understand
what kind
of uh then return
the calendar events.
Okay. So why am I saying I'm giving an
extra instruction. So I say the first
step is this, second step is this, third
step is this. is because the only
downside to an AI agent is that we're
relying on a prompt to do things for us.
So for us to actually implement it and
actually working 100% of the time, we
want to make sure that we give it as
clear instructions as possible. Uh so in
this case tools to get calendar events
and then we leave this as here. Okay.
And we go here. All right. So this
prompt is done. All right. So the AI
agents is successfully set up, right? We
have the prompt, the chat model, the
memory so it remembers the conversation,
the Google calendar which we can use to
actually get events. creating a draft
using Gmail and then we can now actually
test it. So let's go here. Let me go
here and let me actually talk to it. Let
me say hello, how are you? It usually
never likes this question. It will talk
to the chat model. It will think through
the things that I told it and it will
say hey he just asked me how I am. I'm
not going to use any calendar events or
draft because that's not the instruction
that was given. So this is the the thing
about AI agents. They're smart enough to
understand. Uh, let me ask it so you can
see the memory. What was the first
question I asked? The first question you
asked was, "Hello, how are you?" So, you
see how it remembers previous ones?
That's the memory that it has. It has
the context window like I mentioned. All
right. So, now let's actually put this
to test. Let's create a draft on the
email. Um, let's say I want to create a
draft uh email draft.
So, it will think through does do I have
enough context to actually create the
email? And then it will ask me, hey,
they received an email address. It needs
a subject line. It needs the message or
content you want to include in the
email. So in this case, I'm going to
give it a email address. So the email
address will be my email. So this is the
email address right here. And then in
the email, just say that I'm happy you
are building automations
on NN
and that you are going to take over the
space. There you go. Right. So we save
this. What it does is that now it has
enough context to actually draft the
email. It'll send back an email saying,
"Hey," or send back a message saying,
"Hey, I've created a draft for you with
a message expressing the happiness about
building automations in NN." And so, if
I go to my email now, right here, I can
see that I have drafted an email saying,
"Hey, great to see your work on NN
Automations. Hik, I'm happy you're
building automations on end. You're
going to take over the space. Best
regards." Right? And this was done using
AI. I just told it to the overall
context of the email and it show it does
it did the subject line and it did the
body of the email and it send it to the
email that I told it to. So that right
there is for the Gmail like thanks
thanks a lot.
All right so let's do the calendar. So
let's say I let's go to my calendar.
Let's see what I have on this week.
Okay. So this week I have groceries
tomorrow and then I have strategy
session with James on the 21st. These
are all connected to different accounts.
So if I say theoretically can you get
all the calendars that I need for or
give me all the events that I have on
this week it will say I have outskill I
have strategy session and I have
groceries. So let's go here. So now I'm
going to ask it can I have all of the
events I have going on this week. So now
what it does is that it talks to the AI
goes to Google calendar pulls it back.
It takes a while because I have three
events or four and it tells me every
single thing. So I have outskill on
August 14th, groceries on August 19th,
strategy session with James on August
21st, uh, and outskill on August 24th.
Now outskill is something that I had
today like this morning at 1:00 a.m. Um,
which is why it tells it as well. Um, so
that's why it says next day and it gives
me all the events right here. Right? So
I don't have to go to a calendar. I can
have an AI agent actually pull this for
me. Now this right here is a very very
elementary example. I just wanted to
show you exactly how you can build one
step by step. And we only have Google
calendar and we only have credit
drafting email. But we can add hundreds
of more softwares to this which makes AI
agents incredibly powerful to use for
businesses because it saves them the
time to have to go to the software to
find something. Right? So very very
good. Now the most important thing when
it comes to the AI agent is not the
tools itself. It's not the memory or the
model. It's the actual prompt that you
tell the AI agent to do. because once
you have 20 tools hooked up, right, like
these, once you have 20 or even 30 tools
hooked up to the same AI agent, it makes
it incredibly powerful, but it also
increases the error or the chance that
it actually errors out. Errors out just
means that it doesn't do what you want
it to do, right? So, you want to make
sure that the prompt itself is so so
like 90% of your time or 80% of your
time should be spent towards the prompt
because you saw that setting things up
on Google Calendar and Gmail is actually
not the hard part, right? You want to
make sure that what you tell the AI to
do, it actually does it. So, that's what
the prompt does for you. Congrats on now
being able to understand and build your
first AI agent inside of init. In the
next section, we're actually going to
make it smarter. We'll dive deep into
how you can actually build
high-erforming, scalable AI agents using
advanced frameworks and prompting
techniques. You'll discover how you can
structure AI agents using data tables,
integrate them with thousands of AI
models, all within one tool, and apply
practical frameworks that will make them
10 times smarter. So, by the end, you'll
not only be building agents, but you'll
build actual systems.
In this video, I'm going to show you
eight Nitn AI agent hacks that I wish I
knew when I got started that will help
you build AI agents at three times the
speed and make them way more powerful.
All right, so here we have an agent in
Nitnen. And the first hack is that you
can actually chat to it, but you can
make the chat public available because
tons of times you can actually speak to
the AI agent like this. But what if you
don't want to go into any what happens
then? Do you have to use Telegram? Do
you have to use WhatsApp? Well, in this
case, you can actually get a link using
this button right here. You can copy it.
We can then make the actual agent
active, which means that we can use it
now. And if I paste it here, I can see
that now I can actually chat to it as if
it's a chatbot. something that most
people don't know because that hence why
they connect this to a telegram or
something else. Well, you can actually
just use this URL which is public that
you can chat to it say hello and this
will execute right. If I go to
executions I can see that we just
executed the workflow right it went here
it used the open router which is the LM
which is his brain and he gave us hey
how can I assist you today and let's say
I wanted to send a message in Gmail I
said send an email to
mikuela.45gmail.com 45@gmail.com.
I'm going to press go. So, we sent it a
message and now it's asking us, sure,
what would you like the subject and
message email to be? As you can see here
again, it ran. So, if I refresh,
I can see that it ran again.
And the input was send an email to me.
45. And if I say that we have dinner
tomorrow, I can go. This would just ask
me the subject line because of the fact
that we didn't prompt it, right? But
let's say it's dinner at 7 p.m. And now
you can see that the email about having
dinner at 7:00 p.m. has been sent. So if
I go to my email,
I can see that we have dinner at 7 p.m.
right here. All right, the second set of
hacks is within the brain of the AI
agent, which in this case is Open
Router. And in case you want to watch
how to connect Open Router to N10, check
out the video up here. As you can see
here, we have all the models that we can
think of. Quen, Grock, Chat, GBT,
Deepseek, all that stuff. But the hacks
is within the options. So we have all
these options that most people don't use
because they have no clue what they are.
So the first one is frequency penalty.
So the frequency penalty can either go
to I believe two and it can either go to
-2, right? So from -2 to two. A lower
value tells Chbt, hey, can you make the
actual thing more repetitive? Which
means whatever you're saying, use the
same kind of words. Whilst if I put two
a higher value, it's more creative. So
we're giving Chad GBT or the I'm saying
Chad GBT because we're using OpenAI, but
we're giving the brain or the AI agent
the ability to change how repetitive it
is with the answers that it gives us.
Then the second one is maximum number of
tokens. And so a token is actually four
characters. So if I put a token limit of
let's say 200, this would be roughly 800
characters, which means that it will cut
the actual text, the output that the LLM
in this case gives us. This is great if
you want to set a limit on the amount of
words that you want the AI in this case
the brain [music] to give you to
actually save money on credits for the
chatbt claude gro anything like that.
The next one is response format. So we
have text and we have JSON. So usually
you would have text but JSON is great in
case you want to take some sort of input
and structure it in a way where we have
variables come out right. So let's say
we have a block of text which contains
first name, last name and email, right?
But it's not structured. It's all within
one place. We use JSON to actually
structure it. So we can divide the first
name, divide the last name, and divide
the email. But usually we use text just
because of the fact that we also have
another hack which allows you to do that
structuring thing that I just told you
about. Then we have presence penalty. So
instead of words in this case, it's the
topic itself. So if you put a higher
number, then it's more creative. A lower
number is more repetitive. Then we have
sampling temperature. So a lower
temperature in this case is more
predictable. And the higher temperature
is more creative. So we give AI the
ability to be more creative when giving
us the output. Then we have timeout. So
sometimes the AI agent actually runs and
the open router starts running and it
doesn't work right. It keeps on running
and running and running. Maybe there's
some problem with a server. So what we
say here is we say hey you have 360,000
milliseconds I assume maximum amount of
time request. Yeah milliseconds. And we
say hey you can only go until this long
and after that just stop. It's just
easier when you want to error handle
which means that when something goes
wrong just stop the workflow. when it
runs past a certain time period. In this
case, it's 360,000 milliseconds. Um, and
we just stop. The next one is max
retries. So, sometimes you use open
router the LLM, but it doesn't work. So,
you say, hey, if something doesn't work,
just try again this many times. So, if
you put 10, then it will try again 10
times. Then we have top P. As you can
see here, if I go hover, it says
controls diversity. So, it's controlling
the diversity of the output that we get
from the LLM. All right. The next hack
is actually the ability for AI to be
able to enable a fallback method. So
enable a fallback method means that if
this doesn't work, we can actually add a
new LM as a fallback. Right? So if I put
OpenAI here, that means that it will
first try here and then it will try
OpenAI. So let's say I go here and I add
a fake connection. I do.
So just do test
save. Let's do this test. Right? So this
is a fake credential. It shouldn't work.
If I go here and I chat to it,
hello. What this will now do is that it
will go here. It has an error, but it
will try again because it has a fallback
lm. And so that's amazing because
sometimes the first one doesn't work,
but the second one does. All right. The
next one is within the actual memory. So
if I go inside, I can see that we have a
context window length, which most people
still have no clue what it means. What
this means is that five, this is the
amount of past interactions. So let's
say you say, "Hey, how are you?" That's
the first interaction it responds.
[music] Then you ask another question
which is can you send an email to John
and then can you add a Google sheet? Can
you add XYZ? Right? Then it will get the
past interactions which is your
questions as context for the next
output. Right? So if you put 10 or if
you put 15 then it will take more
interactions in the past that it will
use as context. Now why do we want to
restrict this to about 5 to 10 is
because the more interactions the more
how would you put it? more context you
give it, the more it can pull, the more
credits you use. And so five, I think,
is a suitable amount of interactions
that we can use within the AI agent. But
you can increase or you can decrease.
The next hack is actually within the
tools. If I go here and I put think, I
can see that I have a think tool which
invites the AI agent to do some
thinking. So in theory, the AI agent
typically thinks through what it needs
to do using its prompt or its LLM. In
this case, it would be open router. But
we give it an additional tool, the think
tool, which allows it to think even
more. As you can see here, we have a
predefined prompt, which is a prompt
that we never put before. It's already
here, which has use the tool to think
about something. It will not obtain new
information or change the database, but
just append the thought to the log. Use
it when complex reasoning or some cache
memory is needed. And so this right here
is the ultimate assistant AI agent that
I built, which is connected to a contact
agent, email agent, calendar agent, and
content creation agent. And so by
feeding it the tool which is the think
tool, it gives it the ability to have a
another step of reasoning. Reasoning
just means to think through what it
needs to do to then be able to actually
take the right action in the right order
as opposed to not having this [music]
and just using the prompt and using AI,
right? Sort of like that extra step. And
the next hack is actually the ability
for us to be able to connect AI agents
within the tools cuz most times what you
do is just connect it to the software.
So Gmail or you can connect it to an
external workflow. So you say sub
workflow. So where is it? Sub uh
workflow
calling anytime workflow right here
which basically calls another workflow
to take action. But what if the workflow
was inside this workflow right? And well
in this case we have access to the
contact agent which is another AI agent
which is connected to more tools. And
the same thing with email agent,
calendar agent and content creation
agent. This gives us the ability to be
more flexible in the I guess AI agents
that we build and have that extra
feature of not having to build another
AI agent in another workflow and just
have it all within here. All right. So
the next one is actually within the tool
software. So if I go in here to send a
message, we have to make the connection.
We have to do set automatically the
action the thing that we're doing. And
now we're introduced to three different
variables that we have to do as an
input. You can put your email here, you
can put the subject line, and you can
put the message. But because of the fact
that it's a chatbot, so the input
changes over time. What we can do is
press this button right here, which lets
AI in Nitnen define the input. So it
defines what goes in here so that you
don't have to put it manually, right?
You give AI the ability to choose what
goes in there as an input u for you to
do it. And this makes it so much easier
for us to be able to make AI agents
because all we have to do is literally
just press this button for any parameter
that comes through. All right, the next
hack is actually the ability for
multiple AI agents to be connected to
the same exact model, right? Which you
can see right here. We have one step
right here, which is not an AI agent.
It's just an AI step, which is connected
to a model. And we can see that all the
AI agents are all connected to the same
exact thing. All right. So, the next
hack is actually the ability for us to
use the structured output parser, which
allows us to be able to do the thing
that I mentioned before, which is using
JSON to take an unstructured input. So,
it can be a block of text, can be
whatever it is, and we structure it in a
way where it actually makes sense. So, a
variable. In this case, we have a human
in the loop sales agent, which drafts
sales emails for us. So, I put my name,
my email, my company name, intent,
budget, project description, and
timeline. I can press submit. And what
this will now do is it will send it to
the Google sheet. it will add it there
to our CRM. It will then talk to the
sales agent which will speak to first of
all claude which is its brain and then
it will then speak to the structured up
parser because that is a thing that is
going to help it to be able to make the
subject line and the body of the email
which is then going to be sent to our
email. And if you go right here I can
see that this was the input which is a
block of text and the output was the
email body and the subject line as well.
And if you're wondering how we wrote
this, you can simply go to chat GBT and
ask it, hey, can you draft me a input
schema using JSON that allows me to have
a subject line in an email body of the
email? And that's exactly what you paste
here. And that's what the AI will use to
then give you the output that looks like
this from an input that looks like this.
So that marks the end for the eight and
AI agent hacks that I wish I knew when I
got started that makes your build of AI
agents much faster and way more
powerful.
Hey, in this video I'm going to show you
four agentic frameworks that can make
your AI agents inside of Niten faster,
smarter, and way more scalable. You see,
most people try to build one big agent
that does everything. But that's why it
breaks. It slows you down, and honestly,
it's impossible to scale. So, I'm going
to walk you through each framework step
by step, show you exactly how it works,
when to use it, but also when you can
apply it within your automations. With
that being said, let's dive in. All
right, so the first framework is the
prompt chaining. So what this means is
that you are using a AI agent and you're
prompting it in a chain. So you're
saying, "Hey, let's use the AI agent for
to do this first. Then you chain it."
Chain it just means you connect it to
the next AI agent which does another
thing and then chain it to another AI
agent which does another thing and then
you do whatever you have to do, right?
So this right here is what we call
sequential reasoning where each AI agent
um builds on the previous output to
refine accuracy and context. So this
right here is based on the output of
this. This right here is based on the
output of this and so on. And this
framework is great for multi-reasoning.
Um, but I'm going to show you exactly
what that looks like. So, right here we
have a form which leads into the first
AI agent uh, which writes the outline
for the blog. Then it goes to the second
AI agent which looks at the outline. It
evaluates how it is and it changes it
up. And then we give it to the third AI
agent which actually writes the blog
before putting the blog into a Google
document that we have access to. And so
if I go here to execute workflow, I can
put AI in finance or whatever topic you
want to talk about. I can press submit.
What this will now do is that it will
send the data to the first AI agent.
Right? This is chaining prompts because
we have one prompt here which does its
own output. Then it goes to the second
one to do its second output. And then
finally it goes to the third AI agent
again prompt chaining. We're chaining
different prompts. Um because these are
a series of different prompts, right?
This prompt is just to make the outline.
This prompt is just to evaluate the
outline while this prompt is to actually
make the full blog based on the outline.
Right? Three different prompts but we're
training it together. And then finally
we will add it to our Google document.
As you can see we're finished. If I go
here, this is the blog that we get uh
with all the information from these
different agents. Now don't get too
fussed about the actual quality of the
blog. I just wanted to show you exactly
what the framework is. But going inside
here for example, we have the same
prompt. So system message. This is one
prompt which the user message because
the user message is the thing that we
actually give it. The system message is
basically giving the AI agent context
what it needs to do in general
which is then changed to the second
prompt which is a different prompt right
here
right right here with a user prompt as
well. And then we have the third AI
agent with another prompt which is the
one right here. And yes these are very
very small prompts just to show you an
example uh with a user prompt as well
which are all changed together. And one
main advantage to this framework as well
is that when you prompt chain, when you
add one step after the step after the
step as well, it's much easier to debug.
Debug just means that if something goes
wrong, how can you fix it? How can you
go there and fix it? Well, it's much
easier here because it's linear, right?
Linear just means that it's one line,
right? This is one line. It doesn't go
up and down. And so when there's a
problem, it's much easier to go here and
fix it because you know exactly what
step it came from. The next framework is
called parallelization. Is a big fancy
word. uh which basically means that we
have multiple agents. So you can have
three, four, five, 10, 11 uh which are
all working simultaneously which means
at the same time on different tasks
right and so let's say we have a AI
agent which allows us to create the
LinkedIn hook then the LinkedIn body
then we merge them and then you send it
to the final agent to make the final
post. So let's say I say write a post
about how AI is going to impact
agencies. I can press go and now what
this will do is that it will send the
information to the first AI agent to
write the hook. then the second AI agent
to write the body and then we merge them
together. We put them all in the same
paragraph which then goes and feeds into
the final AI agent to write the LinkedIn
post and then it gives it to us on here.
So our AI agency is ready for the AI
revolution. The tools we want to use are
evolving fast and it gives us the whole
body. Again don't look at the quality
just look at the fundamental theory
behind this AI agent and how it works.
[music] And as you can see we have the
output right here the first output. This
is the hook. Then we have the second
output right here. And the way that this
fundamentally works is that we have the
data going here. And then we have also
the data going here. But this doesn't go
through until this finishes as well
because they're all connected to the
merge node. And the merge node makes it
so that we say, "Okay, cool. Go to the
length and hook and write the length and
hook, then send me the input, the first
input, which is input one. Then go to
the length and body and send me the
second input. And only once when I have
both inputs together, then I go to the
next steps, right? Which is great
because now we get two items which is
right here. One item and one item. Then
we can then use the aggregate module or
node. As you can see here by the diagram
is that we take multiple series of items
and we put them all in one. And if I go
here, I can see that I have the output
one and the output two, right? which is
the hook and the body before feeding it
into the final agent right here to write
the LinkedIn post which is the output
right here right and so we give it the
output which is the called an array an
array is just a way for us to store
different pieces of information and so
that's really how the parallelization
works now the reason why we would use
this over the others is because it is
faster at processing information um as
you can see here it goes here and then
it automatically goes here not
automatically but in a faster way rather
than the other frameworks And then we
can merge them all together before
sending it to the agent. And it's very
very structured in a way where we go to
the first one then the second one and
the third one and the fourth one. That
way you can keep track of all the single
steps. And one more thing it can do is
that it reduces the bias or error uh
from a single model because we have
these different agents giving their own
perspective or or the output in this
case. And this right here typically we
would use it for research uh or
multi-dommain inputs where speed and
diversity matters. And the use case of
using this type of framework is when we
are doing research where we're doing
research we typically want to split it
up in a way where we do one sort of
piece of research first then we go to
the second one then we go to the third
one and so on. So that way you're
splitting it and then you're merging it
all together and then you're aggregating
it and then you're doing something else.
The [music] third framework is called
the routing framework. Now this
dynamically directs the data. So this
sends the data to the appropriate agent
based on [music] a classifier. Let's say
we receive an email. Then we have the
step right here which is classifying the
email based on whether it's in high
priority customer support promotions or
finance and billing. And based on the
answer so based on the classification of
the email that we receive, we send it to
the appropriate agent we go here to the
higher priority agent customer support
agent promotion and finance as well. And
then they can execute their own tasks
which means that they can do their own
action, create their own emails and so
on um by their own right and they're all
rooted by the output that we get from
the previous step. And so this is great
because it makes our AI agents and
workflows much more adaptive, right? And
we are only using the right model or
logic when we have a certain use case,
right? So in this case, when we want to
add a new step, all we have to do is go
in here, add a category. So we can say
love, hello. And now we have a new
filter right here, which you can then
add another AI agent. So agent and we
have this here. And you can easily add
more and more options based on the
output that we get here. And this is
great again because when we have a input
and we want to classify the input based
on whether it's X, Y and Z, then we can
have a logic that says okay if this is
something then we send it here. If that
is something else then we send it here
and so on. And you go through the logic
as well. And so let's say I send myself
an email right here. I can execute the
workflow. This will then be able to
classify the email based on whether it's
all of these. In this case, it saw that
it's promotions. And what it did is that
it spoke to the AI agent to then create
the email that we can then have in our
draft. And if I go here, I can see that
it dropped the email back to the email
that we got here. Of course, this is a
spam email, not spam, but promotional
from Wise. Um, but as you can see, the
AI agent drafted a very, very insightful
email um using the prompt, right? And so
that's essentially what it does. Very
very easy. only use this framework
really when you want to be able to route
to the appropriate agent based on the
input that we get. And the best use case
that I can think of when it comes to
this framework is just this, right?
Getting emails, classifying them, and
then sending them to the right agent uh
based on the type of email. The last
framework is called the optimizer. If
you haven't watched the full video of me
building out this human in the loop AI
sales agent, watch it up here. But the
way it works is that we have a form
right here which has different details
that the customer or the lead in this
case would fill out. So let's say I put
my name, email, company name. I'm
looking for a lead generation service.
My budget is less than a,000. My project
description is that we want a system
that can generate more leads and we want
it within a week. If I press submit,
what this will now do is that it will
add it to our CRM. In this case, CRM is
just a way that we store information
about each client or leads. Then it
talks to the first AI agent which writes
the sales email that we can send back.
What it does then is that it sets a
variable. In this case, the variable
would be subject and email body which is
subject here and email body which will
send it to our internal team. You can
see here we have the action required new
lead with budget of less than 1,000 and
a team member from our team before
sending it to the actual customer. We
can respond. So I said don't ask them a
question. uh just telling me we're
available at Tuesday 3 p.m. tomorrow
because as you can see here it asked
them a question of whether they are
available. I press submit. So I give a
feedback. What this does is that it then
classifies the feedback whether it's a
positive feedback or negative feedback.
If it's negative, what this does is that
it roots it to the next step which
actually based on the feedback that we
gave it rewrites the actual email using
the next agent right here. And it gave
us a new email which we then send back
here because again the name of the
variables is the same whether it comes
from here or from here which we are able
to then send it back to our team right
here for another revision. I can press
respond. I can say, as you can see here,
we we actually have the the revised
version. So, Tuesday at 3 p.m. And I can
say yes, all good. When I press yes, all
good, and I submit it, what this will
now do is that it will send the email
because now it's it's approved. It's
positive feedback to the customer. So,
if I go here, I can see that I'm
obviously I'm the customer and I'm the
team member here. But this is what the
customer will get. They will get a fully
sales optimized email obviously with
results and everything that responds to
their inquiry from the website. And so
this framework right here is amazing.
It's actually one of the best frameworks
that I've used so far within AI agents
when it comes to adding a feedback loop,
right? Because what we're doing here is
that we're writing the sales email and
you can apply this to content or
whatever it is, but we're writing
something then we're sending it for
revision to our team. Then the team
gives us feedback. Then based on the
feedback, we categorize whether this is
positive feedback or negative feedback.
If it's negative, then we send it to
another AI agent. So as you can see
here, we have two options, approved or
denied. and we give it the description
of what approved is and what denied is
and based on the appropriate output so
whether it's actually approved or denied
we send it two different ways again
denied will go to the AI agent which
revises the email and so this is
prompted to to know that this needs to
update the sales email based on provided
feedback and this is the email that we
get which we send back here which then
sends it to our team again for human in
the loop and this is a whole repetitive
process over and over again now this is
great because it enables the AI a agent
to have continuous learning, right?
Because most of the times, not most of
the times actually, sometimes the AI
agent will not spit out something that
we're actually happy to send to the
client. And so instead of sending it to
the client directly, what we do is that
we have a repetitive process. As you can
see, this is a circle sort of whatever
you rectangle. All right? But the
concept is that we have a loop, right?
Human in the loop. The human is always
in this loop and we're able to give it
feedback and iterate on the feedback
again and again again and again until we
give it positive feedback saying yeah
all good or yeah no changes and then it
sends it to the client itself and then
it does its own thing. Now this is great
for systems that require quality
assurance which means that they require
someone to give some sort of input or
feedback based on the output that AI
gave. Um this can be applied to again
sales outreach or customer support
because those are the ones that interact
with a customer. And so between the AI
making something and the customer
receiving that something, there has to
be an intermediate step of us giving a
feedback. And usually that's having
another person, right? And so in this
case, this allows us to have a
repetitive loop, feedback loop to
generate different things. And that's
where we would use the optimizer
framework.
In this video, I'm going to show you
exactly how to prompt your AI agents
inside of any so they actually do what
you want with less errors and more
accurate results. I'll break down the
main types of prompts, show you exactly
how to structure them, and explain how
to write prompts that actually get
results. All right, so to quickly recap
what an AI agent is, we have an input,
we have an output, and in the middle,
the AI agent is instructed, right, which
is the prompts that we're going to go
through today. Uh, and based on the
instructions, it then uses its brain,
which is LLM, which is just an AI, which
thinks through the instructions, and
then takes action on the tools based on
the instructions that it was given. So,
[music] it's exactly the same as an
employee. It's only AI. And the
instructions that you give it are going
to be in a prompt format in an actual
text. So, this right here is what it
actually looks like. This is the most
basic version of an AI agent inside of
any. The first thing we have is a chat.
So, I'm going to go here and talk to it.
I'm going to say hello. What this will
do is that it will send the input over
to the AI agent. It will then call its
brain because that's how it thinks. and
it will call the memory tool because we
also have the ability to remember uh the
conversations that we had. Now inside
the AI agent we only have two types of
prompts only two right the first one is
a user message and the next one you can
find right here is a system message. So
in this case if you have an employee
right you tell the employee a task you
say hey can you do this for me that is a
user [music] message. Then the
instructions that you gave the employee
before that is a system message. So two
different types of prompts for two
different types of reasons. And so right
here we have two different options for
source for prompt. Source for prompt
just means hey where are we getting the
input like what is that thing that we're
receiving and where is it coming from.
We have connected chat to a node and we
have the find below. Now if I go out of
here I can see that right now the AI
agent in this case is connected to this
node right here. A node is just is a
square. That's what they call it. And
this right here is a chat trigger node.
It's one that is native to nitn which
means that nitan owns it. And typically
that is what we use to be able to speak
to the AI agent, right? And so the input
comes from here. So if I go inside, I
can see [music] that we chat to the AI
agent through the chat mode. So through
here I go here open chat and I say,
"Hey, so where are you from?" Right? And
so right now what this does is that it
takes this input, right? Where are you
from? It sends it over here and this
will now be the user message, right? So
this JSON fancy thing that you see which
is code because again everything is code
behind the no code platforms the irony
there. Um but that is a thing that the
AI agent uses as sort of an input to
then take action right the second part
is the find below. So there are times
where we're not connected to the chat
node. So every single time that we're
not connected to this node right here we
have to use the find below because we
have to define the input based on where
it comes from. So, for example, if we
have an AI agent that looks like this
and the input comes from Telegram, which
is just a platform where you chat um
sort of like WhatsApp. If I go inside
here, I can execute the step and now
it's going to wait for someone to send a
message to Telegram. And right here, I
have a new chat pulled up. And when I
press start, it automatically sends a
message, which is slash start. And that
is a trigger right here, which is text
start. And now, this is a thing that
then goes into the AI agent. And now we
use define below because [music] this
right here chat node like I mentioned is
only for that specific node and the node
changed to telegram. And so we have to
change the input that comes in. And how
we do this let's say this is empty. We
just take the input which in this case
would be text right because that's the
text that we get and we drag it across
here. Or alternatively you can curly
bracket curly bracket dollar sign JSON
dot message
dot chat. And so let's say now I execute
the workflow and I just talk to telegram
and I say hey how's it going
what this will now do is it will send
the input over here it will then talk to
its brain and then based on its brain
and based on the instructions that we
give it which I'll show you exactly how
to write that instruction then it will
do its thing it will give us the output
and the output will be in telegram which
in this case it's hi I'm ready to assist
you how can I help you today and so
that's where we would use the define
below rather than the chat trigger node
And this is the one that we mostly use
because again charter node I feel like
we only use it when we test uh rather
than anything else. So I'm going to say
hello here just to put this as an
example. And now we're going to go on to
the most important prompt which is the
instructions. So that's system message.
So if I go to system message and I go to
expression and I go to full screen. Now
this is the playground. This is where we
write the actual prompt. And so I'm
going to paste a structural prompt that
we typically use right here. Now the
first thing is the actual formatting. So
we use something called markdown
formatting. So if you see uh these sort
of hashtags or sometimes you even see
this
right here. What this is is let's say I
go to a Google document. If I write
hello right and I go to right here
heading one I can also write hello and
then this turns to heading one. And so
what this means is that this is heading
one.
This is heading two. This is heading
three,
right? And so why do we do it? It's
because then the AI knows the hierarchy,
right? Sort of like you're doing an
essay. If the essay does not have a
title, subtitle, uh the text,
description, all that stuff, then it's
very hard to understand. And so you are
using these, you're using hashtags,
right? In this case, this is one, in
this case, it's two. In this case, it's
three. And you can go to four as well.
Then the AI knows exactly, okay, this is
the main thing to look at. Then this is
the one below it. And then this is the
one below it. And so when we look at
this, we're saying, "Hey, this is the
title of the first thing and then the
text, title, [music] text, title, text,
and so on." And if you add things like
these, then this would bold it. So
something like this on a Google document
so that within the text, it recognizes
that this is an important word or an
important phrase. [music] And it does
the exact same thing for all of them.
Now, let's say that you wanted the
overview to be the title, this as well,
this as well. But you realize that
examples aren't that important to be a
title. All you have to do is just put
another hashtag so that this becomes
heading two and so AI understands right
based on the logic heading 1 2 3 that
this is less important than this and so
it will prioritize looking at this
before looking at this. Now the first
thing of the prompt is an overview,
right? So you are a your purpose is to
now if you're watching this video of
prompting then you'll probably be seeing
prompts that look like you are a helpful
intelligent content writing assistant.
You are a helpful intelligent something
something assistant. The reason why we
do that is because we're giving AI an
identity. Okay? And by giving AI an
identity then we're saying then what it
does is it allows AI to psych itself to
make it think that it actually is that
identity. So the output will be higher.
And so here we start by saying you are a
helpful intelligent
personal assistant. Uh the only tool
that we have connected to it is send a
message. So that's fine. [music] And now
we say your purpose is to and then
describe what the AI agent actually
does. And so here it would be your
purpose is to send emails based on just
send emails actually. Yeah, your purpose
is to send emails to
customers. And so that is it. That's the
overview. Now, of course, if it's a bit
more complex that you have different
tools, then the purpose is going to be
longer because the purpose is different
things. And so this obviously depends on
the complexity. Now, I'm going to go
through a complex agent at the end, so
don't worry. You'll see exactly what it
looks like. But that right here is the
first part. The second part is the
tools. So right now in this AI agent, we
are I believe we're only connected,
yeah, to send a message. And so that is
the only tool. Now again, a tool is a
software is a thing that the AI agent
uses to take action. And so the first
thing is adding the tool name. So we
say, hey, heading one tool and the first
thing we write is the tool name. Send
message. Bear in mind that the tool
name, make sure it's the exact name of
the actual tool, not an extra e, not an
extra r, right? Exactly. And now we have
to add the function and when to use it.
So this tool will be used when sending
emails to customers.
That's it. And then and so if you have
more tools then you have more names. The
n tool
name and then tool description
description. That's it. And the more
tools you have the more you add right
here. Right? And you keep going on and
on and on. And then we have rules. So
rules are great to then be able to give
it guard rails. So guardrails just means
that let's say you're in the bowling
alley. You know when you're at
bowling and they add the the little
sides on the the little things that they
put in the sides cuz you're completely
horrible. It's only because by putting
those guardrails there's a good chance
that you will hit the target, right? If
you're anything like me at bowling when
I throw the ball it goes out, right? And
so by putting those those walls, it
makes sure that it actually hits the
thing. And so that's exactly what we're
doing here. We're saying hey these are
the rules and saying always do this
never do this if unsure do this. Now
these three are obviously optional. It
depends on what rules you want. But in
this case you can say always make sure
to have an email address
before sending an email.
Right? Because we want to make sure that
we actually sending the email to the
right person or a person at all. Then
you can say never send an email if you
don't have
an email address.
And if unsure, just ask the user to
clarify.
Simple as that. Obviously, it depends on
your use case, right? Again, it depends
on your use case. So, the rules might
change, but for this specific use case
where we're just sending emails, then
this [music] is fine. And then lastly,
we have output format and examples. Now,
this is optional. I wrote this as
optional because it depends on your use
case. If I'm doing something like an
email send a message assistant, there's
no need to put output format or
examples, right? But what these do is
you tell it to basically give you the
output in a specific format. So JSON or
Buddha list or whatever it is and it
actually does it. So in this case, what
we could do is we can say format all
responses as a short concise
sentence, right? Or you could say a
bullet list
full of points, right? It depends on
your use case. It kind of depends on
what you want it. [music] Uh for this
case, we can just keep it very very
short and sweet, it's fine. And then
examples here. So examples in this case,
we wouldn't use it, right? But for
something a bit more complex where it
has different steps or we wanted to give
it more guardrails because again, giving
it examples, it is literally just giving
it rules, right? We're saying, "Hey, do
it this way. Here are some examples to
guide you in the right direction. So
adding more guardrails only because AI
agents are great, right? They're they're
amazing. They do really good stuff, but
the margin of error needs to be very
very small when you're actually giving
it to clients. And so if you add more
guards, if you add more examples, then
the chances that it will error out,
which means that something goes wrong,
are very low. And the way that examples
usually work is we have the user.
[music] So we say this is the input. So
let's say I say send an email to or
actually let's say I say make a
LinkedIn post
about life and then you give it the uh
the answer right you say you actually
give it the LinkedIn post so it can use
the LinkedIn post as a reference when
actually giving the output and so why do
we do this is because again with
guardrails the AI agent knows what good
looks like it has expectations am I
giving someone expectations
they will get closer to the actual goal
because it aligns with the expectations
that you have. And so that right there
is a full structure prompt that we use.
Obviously some things you add, some
things you remove depending on your use
case, but this is what it looks like.
And so when you pair up the user message
with the system prompt, the user message
is the input. So what do we get from the
user and the system message is a thing
that it uses to actually think through
what it needs to do. Now I'm going to go
through a single agent step prompt and a
multi- aent step prompt. So a single
agent step prompt just means that we
just have one step before it goes to the
tools, right? And so if I go inside
here, the chat input will be the one
from Telegram, which is a text below,
which is what we covered before. And the
system message will be an overview, not
a personal AI assistant integrated with
Telegram. Your purpose is to help the
user manage communications efficiently
by retrieving the correct contact and
sending accurate well formatted emails
on command. As you can see, the purpose
changed because now we're also saying
you have to retrieve the correct contact
and sending accurate well formatted
emails on command. And now we're giving
it the tools. So the first tool is get
contact, right? And we put this to bold
it to say, hey, this is important. This
is the name. And the description is
retrieves contact details, [music] name
and email, right? So this AI agent in
this case is connected to two different
tools. It's connected to the get
contacts, which is a contact database,
which is the one right here, which has
name, email, and phone number. and is
connected to send email which is another
tool right and so that's why we have get
contacts to retrieve contacts and we
give it a rule we also say use this
first to verify the recipient or
retrieve missing contact information
because if you think about it what if I
say I want to send an email to let's say
Michael James right [music] how does it
know the email of Michael James which is
why it has to call this tool first and
then it can call the next tool and then
we have send emails send emails to
contacts and the rules is never assume
missing details Always ask for
clarification. If unsure, respond with,
"Can you confirm who I should send this
email to?" Keep the message short,
clear, and structured when replying on
Telegram. And so this right here is a
very short prompt that we give it
because again, the AI agent is pretty
simple. We just have a get contact. And
we have sent an email. And now if I go
here, I can wait for the input. So on
Telegram right here, I can say send an
email to Michael James. I can press go.
What this should now do is it should
call the contact uh tool. Then it gives
us the output. And the output in this
case is can you please provide the
subject and the email body of the email.
So you want to send it to Michael James.
So even though it told Michael James and
it knows the email, I didn't give it
what the email was about. And so now
what I can say is send an email to
Michael James about uh and say we have
dinner tomorrow. Now you probably
noticed that I should execute this
first. Uh that I copied and reprompted
this again. Why did I do that? It's
because in this case the AI agent
doesn't have memory, right? And so I
have to reprompt it and say, "Hey, send
an email to Michael James and say we
have dinner tomorrow." And now if I go
to my email, I can see that I have
dinner tomorrow. Hi, Michael James. We
have dinner tomorrow. Best regards,
right? All within just telling it a
single prompt. But none of this would
have happened if I didn't prompt it
right because the AI agent, even though
it's hooked up to these tools, it
doesn't know that it should do this
first and then this, right? Which is why
it's all based on the instructions. I
mean, in, out, right? Let's be
honest. And it's the exact same as an
employee. You give an employee
instructions. You say, "Hey, when you
have to go to file taxes, do it in this
way." He file taxes, he does it in that
way. And then he brings it to you. If
you say it's bad, was not his fault.
It's the instructions, right? And so you
want to make sure that the instructions
are very clear and precise so that the
AI agent can actually do what you wanted
to do. And that right there is a single
agent step prompt, which means that we
only have one step between here and the
tools.
>> [music]
>> And here we have a multi- aent step
prompt. Now, this agent looks
ridiculously big um right here. But it
is a video that I made about building a
personal assistant which you can watch
up here. And the way it [music] works is
the exact same as the previous one right
here. But in this case, we have Telegram
which is the input. We send it here. We
also have the option to do a voice
message. And then inside here, if I go
inside, the input is still JSON.ext
because it comes from Telegram and is
defined below again because we're not
using chat trigger node. And if I go to
the assistant message, I can see that it
follows the same exact structure. It has
overview, tools, rules, and
instructions. And it also has a final
reminder, which I'll explain exactly why
that's there. So the first one is the
overview. So you're the ultimate
personal assistant. Your job is to send
the user's query to the correct tool.
And so in this case, we call it a
multi-step agent prompt because this
right here calls a tool, but the tool is
actually another AI agent. So it doesn't
actually call the tool that takes the
action like the send an email or get
contacts. It calls different agents. So,
contact agent, email agent, calendar
agent, content agent. Why is that? Is
because when we are doing something this
complex, not complex, but we're doing a
ton of tasks, like we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 10 11 12 13 14, 14 tasks that the AI
agent has the ability to do. If we write
all those 14 tasks and we just connect
it all to the same the main AI agent,
there's a very high probability that it
will break. And so we break it down into
a multi-step agent prompt where we say,
"Hey, these are the agents that are
connected to you. If you get some sort
of contact thing, just send it to here.
If you're asked to take action on email,
then call this agent here. Uh if you
have to do anything within the calendar,
call the calendar agent." And the same
thing with content. And then we give a
rules, right? Some actions require you
to look up contact information first,
which is the exact same as we did
before. We say, "Hey, sometimes you need
to go to the contact agent first to get
the contact and then send the email."
That's a step-by-step process that it
has to do. And then instructions call
the necessary tools based on the user's
request. And we give it some
instructions to then give it more
guardrails, right? And finally, we give
it the current date and time. So the
final reminder is just final things you
want to add. In this case, we're adding
the current date and time because AI
unfortunately isn't the best with dates
and times. And so with AI agents, if we
ever connect it to something that has to
do with time, like calendar or send an
email for dinner tomorrow, it needs to
know what today is in order to know what
tomorrow is, right? And so that's where
we add this formula right here. And so
this right here is the exact same as the
other ones. User message is like the one
before. And now we can go on to the next
tools, right? And so from here it calls
the contact agent or the email agent.
And the best way that I can think about
this is like a CEO. A CEO doesn't
actually talk to each employee directly,
right? He talks to the head of sales,
head of operations, head of marketing.
And then the head of marketing talks to
the employees to take action. Why isn't
it the other way? was because if the CEO
had to talk to every single employee, he
would go crazy and there's a good chance
he will get the employee wrong because
there's so many employees, right? And so
right here, if I go to contact agent,
which is the head of contacts, head of
department, we just have an overview and
then we give a tools, right? Get
contact, add or update contact, which is
the tools that we give it here. Get
contact and add or update contacts. Same
thing with this email agent. We have
this overview tools and some rules as
well. final reminder. Same thing with
calendar. I can see the overview, tools,
final reminder and the blog as well.
Just because a contact agent doesn't
have to know today's, date and time to
to get context, but these do [music] uh
overview tool and rules, right? And so
that's it. The input here, the prompt
user message in this case will be AI
defining. And also the only difference
from the singlestep AI agent to the
multi-step AI agent is also the user
message, right? Because if I go here,
right, the user message here will be
Telegram. But if I go inside one of
these, then I can see that this is now
defined automatically by the model. We
say, "Hey, the AI agent is given a task,
right? This is the CEO." Then the CEO,
we're letting AI define what the CEO
tells the head of department, right?
Which is the prompt user message and we
give it a description as well. And then
based on the prompt, based on the
instructions and based on the tools that
the head of department is connected to,
it will prompt each tool correctly. And
so best practices for prompts is be
direct and explicit. Right? The more
direct you are, the better it is. Put
critical info at the top or you can put
it with um markdown formatting to make
sure that it knows, hey, this is title
one, heading two, and heading three.
Keep it concise, no filler, which means
that the more stuff you add, the more
chances it will break. And that is just
a truth, which is why we're not giving
it a huge prompt, right? For the
multi-step AI agent, we're giving it one
prompt and then that goes to the next
and then the next, right? Only include
what improves performance. So don't
include stuff just to include stuff
because again the more context the more
it needs to think and the more someone
needs to think the more chances we have
or the more likely it is for actually
stop working. And if you're someone who
wants to start and scale your AI
automation agency and work with me
personally onetoone then check the first
link down below.
Hey, in this video I'm going to show you
step by step how you can connect over
500 AI models to [music] your NA10 AI
agents using open router and also show
you how I built a full AI agent that
actually decides what model to choose
based on the question that it was given.
With that being said, let's dive in. So
if we go to end right here, the way that
the AI agent works is that we have an
input. We then have the actual AI agent
which has instructions. This is the
prompt saying hey if you you are helpful
intelligent XYZ [music] you do this and
you do that based on the input that
you're given and then what it has is
it's connected to its brain which is an
LLM which is the one that we're going to
be changing today the memory and the
tools and then give us the output. The
only thing with this is that the brain
itself when we go to NN chat model this
is the brain and I look for the software
itself we can see that these are
individual softwares these are
individual LLMs. So if I want to connect
claude that means now I have to go to
claude and make an API key and then
choose a model from here. But if I want
to choose OpenAI then I have to go to
platform. OpenAI add money there and do
this exact same thing for every single
chat model there is. But the question
becomes what if there was just one thing
that we had to connect to the AI agent
that we can then use to access all the
models al together. Well welcome to open
router. All you have to do is go to open
router.ai. Um I'm going to leave the
link down below in case you want to
check it out. And then we see here on
the top right that we have different uh
places that we can go. So if you go to
models, this will basically show us all
the models that we have that we are able
to connect with open router to then be
able to access in our automations,
right? We have DeepSeek. I don't know
what this is. Um there's tons of them,
more than more than you probably know,
right? There's a whole list 500 models
which is crazy. Then we have chat which
is where we can actually test or we can
actually talk to all the different
models. And then we have rankings which
is actually an interesting feature
because we can see the leaderboard of
which models are the best. In this case
top this week will be Grock. And then if
I go below to market share uh but below
here to categories we get to see which
model is the best by what category. So
marketing for example I can see that
Gemini 2.5 flash is the best for
marketing. And if I go to sales or
whatever it is, science, I can see that
we have Gemini 2.5 flash, right? And so
you get to see exactly which models.
This is a live representation of which
model is the best for what specific use
case that you can then use, right? But
for this video, I'm not going to show
you which model is the best. I'm just
going to show you how you can connect it
to. Uh the first step here is to make an
account. Once you made an account, you
go to profile and you go to keys. When
you go to keys, this is like the exact
same thing that we did for Claude,
OpenAI, Grock, Gemini. We have to create
an API key. The only difference with
this API key is that we only have to
create one key to access all the models
instead of creating one key per model.
Right? We press here. Let's name it all
models key. Uh reset limit every choose
how often the limit should. No, NA is
fine. No limit. Press create. And now
you have this key right here which you
can copy. You can then go to endn chat
model look for open router right here.
And then to connect your open router
account you can create a new credential.
Paste the API key that we just had and
name it all models. Let me go and press
save.
And now you have access to this API key.
Now of course this is not free. So the
next step we have to do is add credits
into our account so we're able to access
all the LLMs and use them. Uh I'm going
to go here profile to credits
and yeah also credits here and now you
get to add credits here. Now the thing
is you would add credits anyways because
you would have to go to Chachib Claude
Gemini Grock you have to make an API key
but even those softwares are not free
and so this just allows you to make it
so much easier for yourself to just add
money in one place so that you're able
to actually access all the models and
quick note here when you're working with
clients and actually implementing these
automations and AI agents into their
system sometimes you would use more than
two LLMs maybe one for writing content
maybe one for structuring data maybe one
for reasoning Right? And so this right
here gives us the ability to tell the
client, hey, just make an account on one
place. You don't have to go to every
single LLM to make an API key to add
credits, which makes this so much more
structured in the long run. Once we have
the credits down, we can go to NLN. We
can see that now we have access to all
these models right here. Perplexity,
Quen, OpenAI, Claude,
there's a Grock, right? There's a ton of
different models that we can access
through the API version, which is
insane. And this would be the exact same
as just adding
in this case OpenAI
4.1 Mini, right? Because we're using 4.1
Mini here, but we're also using it here,
right? If I go here and I can chat to
it. So, let's say say hello. You can see
that now it's calling open router and
it's giving us an answer. How can I help
you today? All right. So now that we
connected the open router to our Naden
AI agent, now let's make an AI agent
that basically gets the input which is a
question gives it to the first AI agent
which will decide what model to use and
then it will use the model that it needs
to use based on the question that it was
given. Okay. Now the fundamental concept
here is that when we go to open router
and I go to the model if I press
expression this means now I can hardcode
which means I can actually type the
model that we want right which comes
from this list. So I go to GPT4 Turbo. I
have this. Now this is the name of the
actual model. This is the way that the
API recognizes that we want to use GPT4
Turbo. And so in theory, when you think
about it, if you want an AI agent that
decides what model to choose, we need to
give it this text right here, right? And
then it uses that model that we give it
to be able to answer the question. And
so I mapped this out here. This is a
two-step uh AI agent. We have the first
one to choose the LLM which is LLM just
means OpenAI cloud Gemini. And then we
have the second AI agent to give the
answer to the question based on the LLM
that the first AI agent chose. [music]
So if I go here, I can delete this. Now
let's go to the first one agent.
Let's do LLM
router. Keep the input the same. Now the
input is chat input which is this.
Then we're going to need this as well.
I'm going to show you exactly how to do
it. You can go to system message
expression and then I'm going to paste
the message or the prompt that I already
had. Go here, paste it. And so this
prompt right here basically is giving
the AI agent an overview of what it is.
In this case, it's an AI agent that
decides an LLM model. It gives us the
name of the LLM model based on the
question that it was given. And then we
give it context. So we say, hey, you
have access to perplexity sooner, which
is good for extended reasoning and this
and this. You have access to OpenAI 03
mini high which is a costefficient model
that does this. You have access to
anthropic claw 3.5 sonnet which is good
for this right your task is to respond
only in the following JSON format
clearly stating the user's original
query in the selected model right so
this will be the output that we want we
want the let me take this out actually
cuz it will give it to me like that uh
but we want the user query which is the
user question and then we want the model
so that the next AI agent is given the
model that it needs to use and the
question that it was it was given by the
user. And so we also give it a few
examples because it's always good to
give the AI examples. So for example, if
you find a real-time stock price and
latest news on Tesla, we know that
perplexity owner is great for research.
And so it will use the output will be
perplexity sonar. Same thing with craft
a full business strategy for a startup.
It will be open 03 mini high and then
write Python code to build a snake game
and throw a claw 3.5 solid. And at the
end of the video, I'll show you how you
can get the whole system for free. So
don't worry. Um, but this is what we use
to give the AI agent. Now, we're going
to require a specific output format
because of the fact that we are asking,
right? We are asking the AI agent to
give us the output in JSON, right? And
so, I'm going to copy this. I believe
this will be the right way to do it. Um,
require specific output format. This is
good. So, I'm saying, hey, let's connect
this to open.
This isn't the AI agent that will choose
its model. Let's just use 4.1 mini. And
that's fixed. That doesn't change. and
then the output parser because it's
memory which is simple memory which will
be the thing that a gen uses to remember
its conversation. the tools. We're not
going to need any tools here. And then
output parser. We can use structured
output parser right here. And we can say
define JSON schema. And we can say I
believe that it will be
what was it properties? Oh, user query.
And then model. I think this might be
it.
Yeah, I think this might be it. So we
say, hey, uses JSON. JSON is just uh it
stands for JavaScript object notation.
It's just the way that computers speak
to each other. It's like the English for
computers. And so we're saying, hey, I
want the user query as one property and
I want the model to be another property.
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going
to run this. I'm going to go here and
say, can you research Tesla news?
So now it should give me the output.
What is it? There we go. model
perplexity owner and the user query. Can
you research Tesla news?
Which is great. Um, so now I can give
this to the next AI agent to actually
answer the question using this model.
But I show you here if I go here and I
say, can you
generate code for snake game?
This should now use claude, right? So it
should now give me the output of claude.
And so that's how you dynamically change
the model in the next AI agent based on
the input that we gave. And so the next
step is an AI agent again. And the input
will not be connected to the chat
trigger node. It will be defined below
because the input will be user query.
And if I go here to um the chat model
and I go to open router,
zoom out, I can now go to expression
because now I'm going to dynamically I'm
not going to choose this because if I
choose this model right here, it will
always choose this model. It doesn't
change. So I'm going to go to expression
which allows us to change the actual
model by text. And I'm going to paste,
not paste. I'm going to bring this
across so [music] that it uses this
which changes every single time based on
the answer that we get from this AI
agent. Okay. So, I'm going to go here
and then I believe this is it. Yep.
And then AI agent. [music] That's cool.
So, let's see how it works. I'm going to
go here and I'm going to paste this
again. Let me actually rerun this. I
rerun this. Can you generate code for
net game? Now, it's using the model.
It's going here. It's choosing the
actual model that we get. So in this
case it would be anthropic/cloud
3.5 sonnet and now it's using claude to
generate the answer because this was the
output here and we get
the code right here
using cloud and then right here we have
the logs which is essentially what is
the step-by-step process that we just
went through from the start until the
end and so what we did there is that we
have the model and we have the user
query then it goes to the second AI
agent and if I go here I can see that it
use this model to be able to give us
this answer. If I go here, I can see
that this will be the answer. Right now,
let's change it up. Can you do research
on the top AI news in the US? I'm going
to press go. And now I should be using
Perplexity, I assume. Yeah, Perplexity
Sona. It's going to send the model to
this open router chat cuz it dynamically
changes every single time. and we get
the output which is the top news which
is crazy to be honest because now you
have the ability to literally choose
which model you want to use right based
on the input and the model that we used
here is perplexity sonar right it
changes every single time and one thing
you could do here is you can add more
and more models as in you can give it
more context to more models this is only
three models right anthropic openai and
perplexity but you can have over 200 of
course not recommended uh honestly
because it will kind of trip up and it
might get the name wrong and if it gets
the name wrong, then this obviously
wouldn't work. Uh, but you can
definitely add more than three here. So,
it has access to more models in that
case.
In this video, I'm going to show you the
top three ways that you can scrape any
website inside of any in just a matter
of minutes. I'll show you exactly the
fastest way and the most scalable way in
which one you should probably use. All
right, so before we get to the actual
method, let's talk about scraping. So
when someone says I want to scrape a
website, what they mean is that they
want to go inside a domain, a public
domain, right, which is accessible and
they want to extract all this
information right here. Now if you don't
know, each website is actually if I go
to inspect, it's consisted of all this
code. Now luckily we don't have to know
any of this, right? But just know that
this is called HTML. So HTML is a thing
that websites are written in which
allows it to have an image, have this
button that's red, have this video, have
this number, and so on. It makes
websites look pretty. And so when we say
scrape, we're scraping all the
information here, but realistically,
we're scraping this, right? We are
scraping, if I go to inspect, this code,
which you can then use to send emails,
to maybe reply to messages, maybe to
customize a message based on their
website and so on. And so that's what
scraping websites mean. Now, the first
way is using a HTTP request. Now, I
covered this node in much more detail in
my API 101 fundamentals video, which you
can check out up here. But right here,
we introduced to two different fields,
the method and the URL. So, [music] the
URL in this case would literally just be
the website of the actual thing, which
is in this case jammolutions22s.com.
And the method in this case is either
get, delete, head, options, patch, post,
put. Now, these are all methods that we
use when we make a request. A request
just means we're saying, "Hey server,
can you do something for us and give us
back the information?" In this case, we
have to use get because we want to get
information. So now all I have to do is
put get, put the URL, and leave
authentication as none, and leave all of
this blank. And if I press execute step,
you can see here that it's going inside
the website, and it's extracting all the
HTML, the whole code, which you can see
here, which is very, very, very long.
Right? And this right here is what's
behind this. We just extracted this code
right here inside this, right? Which you
can then use to do something else. Now,
the only problem here is that the HTTP
gives us the whole HTML, which is way
too large for us to feed it into maybe
an LLM like OpenAI to maybe generate
emails or generate messages. So, what we
do here is turn the HTML, which is the
whole long code of the website, into
text, which is now readable to someone.
So I can go here to plus I can look for
HTML uh right here. So work with HTML. I
can press this and I can do extract HTML
content which means that it's extracting
the text from the actual thing. And now
we can extract HTML content. The source
data will be JSON because this is JSON
um like this. This is all JSON. And if
you're wondering what JSON is video up
here uh and then JSON property will be
data because this is called the data.
and the key let's call this website text
and let's do body and now if I execute
the step I can see [music] that we
actually get the text of the website so
we got from the HTML that we got which
is just a ton of stuff which is all of
this right all these letters and colors
and images and videos which you
typically don't want we just want the
text we're saying okay just extract the
text from here and as you can see this
is much shorter than this one [music]
just way longer longer than this, right?
And now this is something that you can
add to an AI, right, to drop emails or
do something else. And we also use this
node right here to be able to set up API
requests. Now, API request, I actually
mentioned this in my API 101 video,
which you can find up here. If you go to
any right here on app event, there will
be tons of apps, right? But not
everything is here, right? And so, how
do you automate something within an app
that you can't find the app here, right?
And so let's say I want to use Panda do
but Panda do is not here is not listed
here but I know for a fact that you can
actually automate things within PandaOC
which is where we have to make our own
app using a HTTP request and then we
typically use the HTTP node when the
website it's static no JavaScript which
means that it doesn't actually change
over time and you're testing or building
a simple automation. So we typically use
this for testing or to build something
quick. Now the pros is that this is fast
and it's free completely free. There's
no extra setup or accounts needed. You
just literally need to put a URL and run
it. And it works great for APIs or plain
pages. So APIs, like I mentioned, it's
just the way that softwares talk to each
other. So if you can't find the software
in it, you have to set up your own sort
of app to make it happen, which is where
you use a HTTP node. And plain pages
again, it's this. The website is static.
So it's just that just the text. It
doesn't change over time. It's same.
Now, the cons of this is that it gives
messy and unreadable HTML. So, as you
saw here, this right here gives me the
whole HTML, which isn't really readable,
which is why we have to use something
like this. But if it wasn't for this,
then we would just have to deal with a
HTML that makes no sense to anybody.
Then, in terms of web scraping, it can
handle JavaScript heavy sites. So, sites
that are changing over time that are a
bit more complex, it cannot handle
those. And it's very, very easy to get
IP blocked if scraped a lot. So, if you
scrape this website continuously over
and over again, you will get blocked,
right? There's a good chance you will
get blocked. And on top of that, you can
actually scrape every website. So if I
go to my LinkedIn here and I just copy
the URL and I paste it here inside
LinkedIn isn't a platform that you can
actually scrape on a public level,
right? So in this case, what this did is
that it just literally went to LinkedIn.
It just scraped this. It tried to scrape
it and LinkedIn said, "No, we have a
wall between you and me." And the wall
is an encryption. It's a password that
we have to go through, which is why we
can't use HTTP requests for everything.
All right. All right. So the next method
is using firecrawl. So if you just type
firecrawl right here, you can go to
firecrawl, the web data API for AI. And
this website, the server is great if you
just want to scrape websites. That's
what it's meant to do. And so when you
make an account, just go to your
dashboard
and you are able to then go to API keys,
copy this key, and then if you go back
to you, you can download this. You can
go to fire crawl. You have to install
the node. So there will be a button here
that says install. And then you have
different options right here. But when
you press any options that says scrape a
URL and get its content, you will get
introduced to this page right here. All
you have to do is connect your account
by adding the API key. Press save. And
once this is connected, you now have the
operation which you have to pick which
is what is the action that we're
actually doing. And there's different
options. So the first one is search and
optionally scrape search results. Now
what this means is that you're asking
Google to look something up for me. Then
we have map a website and get URLs. So
this goes inside a website and gets all
the URLs like the about section, the
services, the homepage, all that stuff,
all the URLs that you might need. Then
we have scrape a URL and get its
content, which is literally just
scraping the URL and getting its
content. So going inside the URL and
getting everything back. So the text and
I'll show you how this is different from
the HTTP that we just used. Crawl a
website is a bit more advanced than this
right here. Um, but it still scripts
websites. Then we have get crawl status
which is you being able to get the
status of whether this is done or not.
So you send a request you saying hey can
you just go inside this website and get
absolutely everything that you that you
have and this is saying okay the status
is approved everything's good you can
move forward. Then we have extract data.
So in case we want to tell it hey go
inside the website and extract the email
extract whatever it is. Then we have get
extract status because the way that
these work is that you send the request
at first and then you get the status. So
send a request and get the status and
then custom API calls which is not going
to in case you want to do some more
complex stuff. So in this case we're
just going to use scrape a URL and get
its content. So I'm just going to add my
website go here. Let me delete this.
Looks crazy. Um and I'm going to press
execute step. And what this will now do
if you go to schema is it will actually
extract the text. So in comparison to
the HTTP node that we just used, this
doesn't give us the HTML, but it
automatically does the job that these
two do, right? It goes inside the
website and it gives me the text, not
the HTML. So it's condensed. So you can
see here, if I zoom out,
this is the text of the website. Plus,
we also get the metadata. So we get the
description, and we get a bunch more
stuff that we can use for whatever it
is. And bear in mind that this fire
crawl, I believe, is free. uh they give
you free credits every month. So you
have about 525 credits. I believe that
each scrape is about two two credits per
scrape. But as I mentioned, if you want
to do something more complex, you can
also extract the data which allows you
to put a prompt saying, "Hey, can you
extract this for me from the website and
then you can put a URL here and that
extracts the exact thing that you asked
it to extract. But in theory, what this
would look like is you have the URL. So
you would script it. It'll do this whole
thing. Then you add the markdown which
is just the way that you write English
for computers per se and then you add
this to an AI step to extract the data
that you want to extract maybe what the
offer is of the company uh who are they
targeting for whatever use case you
have. Now firecrawl is great if you want
a clean readable website content. As you
mentioned we are doing the job of these
two just by using one node. You're also
able to script modern uh/dnamic websites
which are websites that change over time
which is great. And if you want data
safe from bans and errors. So there
isn't really any IP banning like HTTP
because behind this node right here
there's a ton of code that happens in
the back end which allows you to be more
safe when you scrape. And the pros here
is handles JavaScript sites easily like
I mentioned. So modern and dynamic
websites. It returns clean markdown or
JSON which is not the full HTML but the
thing that we actually want from the
website which is the text. It uses
random proxies avoid bands. Uh so when
you hear proxies it just means that it's
like sort of some things in the back end
in the code behind this website uh when
it actually scrapes that make it safe
for you to actually do it right so you
don't actually get banned
and can map search or extract data at
scale. So, this is scalable, much more
scalable than this because this only
works for a few sites and then you get
banned or something bad happens. But in
this case, because it's safer, is also
more scalable over time.
The only cons with this is that it needs
an API key plus a small cost per crawl.
So, as we saw, this is not free. I mean,
it is free, but if you want to go above
this, then you're going to have to pay.
And I believe that if I go to the
website, if I go to pricing,
then we have per credits, right? So, we
have 500 credits for free. And if you
want 3,000 credits, you have to pay $16
a month, $16 a month, which is not bad.
Um, but it only depends of how many
credits you need, right? And each scrape
takes about two credits. You can scrape
about 1,500 websites um using 3,000
credits depending on the website and
depending how complex it is. And then
it's slightly slower than a raw HTTP
request. So, this takes a bit more time
uh just because there's more stuff in
the back end. As you can see here, if I
go to execute step one, two, well,
actually pretty fast. Uh, and here,
if I just go to J solutions, it's much
faster, right? Like maybe half the time.
And the third method is API. Now, I've
made a full master class on API, exactly
how it works and different use cases
that you can use with API. You can check
it out up here. But if I go to API
platform, api.com, the way that I would
describe this is the Amazon for
scrapers. So just like on Amazon, people
sell something and others buy something.
There's consumers and there's sellers.
In this case, the consumers is us who go
inside the platform to say, "Hey, I want
to script some Instagram profiles." And
on the seller side, it's like, "Hey, I
just built a scraper that you can use to
scrape Instagram profiles, but you have
to pay me or you have to do some sort of
exchange of of credits or something like
that." And so when you make an account
on Apiy, you can go to console.
And important thing here is that on the
bottom you see that we have 8 GB of RAM
which is memory and we have $5 for free
every single month. Now if you do the
math here depending on which scraper you
use it's free right depending on how
much you use it. And so this is great
because it allows us to scrape tons more
stuff than something like firecrawl or
definitely HTTP because now we have the
ability to scrape Google maps, Facebook,
Tik Tok, tons of stuff that you just
simply can't do with firecrawl or http.
But in this case, let's just do the
website content crawler, right? So the
first step is actually connecting and
it's end to a. So I'm going to go to the
run and actor, which you can find a
here. You can do run and actor actions
run on actor. And by the way, actor is
just the the scraper. So we call them
scraper. Like the Amazon product it's
called in this case an actor. The way to
connect it is go here, press plus, then
go back here, go to settings, I believe.
Yes. And then go to API and
integrations. And you can copy this.
Bring it back. And go to API key and
save and name it whatever you want.
Press save. And now you have your
account connected. And now the resource
is actor. The action that we're taking
is run an actor. The actor source is
recently run actors. And the actor in
this case you can choose um well in this
case we want to use the website content
crawler which you can find right here.
You can go to API store go to website.
Well in this case you can see it here.
And let's say you didn't see there you
can go website content cra.
And now you can start using this scraper
right away. And like I mentioned this
scraper what it is it's something that
well in this case was built by API
itself the platform but usually we have
random people like let me show you we
have compass we have API dojo we have
clockworks we have curious coder and
some other people who actually build
these scrapers and make money out of
them. So as you can see here the pricing
is pay per usage so you pay per run but
since we have $5 of free credits each
run I believe is a few cents. We'll see
when we actually run it. um but is very
very cheap. So in this case, you just
want to test it. Just press start. This
will be an automatic thing that will be
there at default. When you press start,
what this will look like is that it will
start running. It'll show you that it's
running. And here it will show you the
results, the request, the amount of
usage that it takes to scrape the
website and the duration and also the
date. And down here you can see the
actor getting the data. Now, an
important thing here is that we
currently just used API's platform to
scrape, but ideally we want to use it
within our automations. And so, right
here, we can see that we have the full
text of the website, which is great. And
now, in order for us to set this scraper
up, all we have to do is go back to any
I can choose the website content
crawler. And now, we need an input JSON.
So, an input JSON is something that you
can find right here. [music] And right
here, there's two different ways that
you can run it. The first way is manual
where you can start adding the URL of
the website, the different types of
crawlers which is optional but you have
different types. So adapt is switching
between browser and raw HTTP which by
the way makes no sense to anybody. And
then we can use the crawler type which
is the type of thing or the type of way
that we actually crawl the website.
Crawl just means extract all the data
that you can then apply to the actual
[music] scrape. And then there's also
stuff like crawler settings, HTML
processing, output settings, and run
options, which are all things that we
can change. But to keep it simple, we
will not change anything. All we have to
do is go to JSON, which is the way that
we actually use this in the automation.
All I have to do is copy this.
I have to go back to N. I can delete
this and I can paste the URL or not the
URL, the JSON. And now all I have to do
is change the website, right? With the
URL. In this case, let's leave this
right here. I can now press execute
step. If I go back, I can see in the
runs, this is now running. So, we have a
new thing running automatically, right?
Without going into the actual platform,
which is how you use it within your
automations. All right. So, I realized
there was an issue here. And the issue
was that I actually exceeded my memory,
even though it doesn't say here, but
I've been using this a lot more than you
think. Um, but if you're new to this,
you will not have that problem. So, I'm
going to sign out and log in with a
different account. So what I did here is
I just changed the count cuz the other
one was maxed out and now the actor is
running. So we can wait for the
information here. All right. So it just
finished running and we get this data
right here. As you can see I told you
that we don't actually get the text of
the website. What we get is something
called a default data set ID which I can
copy and then well not copy but go to
the next step. So let me just pin this.
Press P so I don't have to rerun this
again. And right here I can go to
schema. I can look for default data set
ID which is right here and I can give it
as well
and make sure that your connection is
correct. And now if I press execute step
I can see that I have the whole JSON
here and down here I have the text of
the website which I can then use for the
next steps. Now, you should only be
using Apify really when you're doing
large scale scraping or complex projects
like LinkedIn, Amazon. Because Apify is
known not for scraping just websites,
but for scraping Instagram profiles or
Tik Tok profiles or Facebook or
LinkedIn. If I go to here, LinkedIn, a
platform that natively does not want to
get scraped. Um, you can see that we can
scrape it using this using these
different scrapers. And we have tons of
options as well. and also when you need
to use pre-built scrapers or browser
automation because these right here are
all pre-built scrapers that we can use
to do whatever it is that we want to do.
And we have a big variety of different
scrapers that we can use for different
use cases. Like I mentioned, social
media is a big one. Uh which is where we
use API for a lot of these things. Uh
but there's tons more as well. Now the
pros is that we have a huge library of
pre-made scrapers actors. It's
cloud-based so there's no setup. It
handles login based or complex sites
which is very good like LinkedIn
something that with a HTTP node you just
can't do because there's an encryption
there's a password and so what they have
is they have proxies that go around the
password they make it seem like they're
an actual user to then script the data
and the cons is that it can get quite
expensive at scale depending on the
scraper that you use depending on the
actor more setup steps for custom logic
and overkill for small simple scrapes
right so if you're using something
really really simple you're better off
going with something like Firepro, which
is simple, it's very easy to set up, and
it's just made for websites. So, now
that you have the skills to build
workflows with AI agents, let's focus on
building just AI workflows. Now, don't
get me wrong, AI agents are extremely
powerful when you have to build them for
businesses. But the reality is that most
of the times we simply don't want an AI
agent inside the workflow because it's
much easier just to have a simple
workflow. And tons of businesses just
need something simple rather than
anything complex that will just make it
harder, that is not scalable, and that
we simply just can't put to production.
And so in the next module, we'll look at
real world AI workflows, projects that
we build step by step for businesses.
We'll look at everything again from
finance, operations, sales, and
marketing. So you'll be able to build AI
agents and workflows at the same time.
I built a noode rag agent inside of nitn
which allows me to search through
hundreds of documents all within
seconds. All right. So this agent is
split up into two different steps. The
first step is new document into
superbase. So if I go here to the SOPs
which tag team made a quick one. I can
see that I have a SOP for a creative
agency. All I have to do right here is
go to file. I can download it as a PDF.
And this is a thing that I have to
upload into Google Drive. As soon as I
upload it into Google Drive, it will
download here and I just have to press
execute workflow. Of course, this
workflow will automatically be will be
executed every on a pulling trigger. So
every day or every hour, whatever it is.
And now this file is stored in our
superbase, which is the vector database
that we have here. And now all I have to
do is go to our next agent, which is the
agent that you'll be using, and go to
open chat and ask it any questions we
have. So if I go to SOPs, I can see that
one of the questions, one of the things
that it mentions is that ClickUp or
Asana or notion are used as a project
management tool. So if I go here and say
what tools
do we use for our project management and
what it's doing now is it's querying the
agent. So it's quering the actual
database that we store the information
in. And it's going to give us an answer.
In this case, it's ClickUp, right? And
if I go here, the answer was ClickUp,
right? So that's exactly how the agent
works. And if you have hundreds of
documents, it will scan through hundreds
of documents and it will give you a
concise answer based on what it found.
All right, so let's go to Miro and let
me show you exactly how it works and
what the whole thing's about. So the
source data is essentially what is that
thing that we give the agent? What is
that thing that we give the database for
it to pull information from when we ask
any questions. Uh in this case it can be
in the form of video, audio, image or
text. We use PDF but you can use any of
these. Now for the source data for the
data for the file whatever you're using
uh to be added to the database again for
the agent to pull information from it
needs to be transformed into an
embedding. Now what the embedding means
is that it takes the file and turns it
into these numbers into vectors right
which gives me a bad bad um memory of
high school. Uh but the embeddings right
here are 0 1 0 0 1 0 0. It's just a
bunch of numbers that represent the file
that we gave it. And then these vectors,
so this is a vector for a specific file
will be stored into a vector database
which is a database which has different
vectors. So different files and that's
the thing that the agent is going to
query is going to ask when it needs to
find anything that we asked it. And
fundamentally that's how a file gets
turned into a vector which gets stored
into a vector database. It might sound
complex but it's actually very very easy
because a file is a vector and database
is just full of vectors full of files.
Now how does it work when you actually
ask it a question? How does it pull
information from the vector database to
give us an answer? Well, the question
that you ask it is in text. You say,
"Hey, what is that XYZ?" Now, those
different letters that you ask, those
sentences that you give or that question
gets turned into an embedding which gets
matched to the embedding sear and that's
how it gives you an answer because it
matches the different numbers. All
right. So, let's go to edit. Let me go
here and we can actually build one from
scratch. So the first one as I mentioned
is pulling data from a Google drive and
that will be the thing that will be
stored into the superbase. So ideally
your team will just drop files in Google
drive and the automation just runs every
every so often every 1 hour every day or
whatever it is. So first step is
actually making the drive. So we made a
drive we called it rag example and
that's the thing that you want to do on
a Google drive because that's the place
that we just drop the documents for it
to go to the superbase. And then we go
here and know the first step here is
watching every new file that is created
because that's the thing that starts the
automation, right? We don't want to
automatically or we don't want to
manually run the automation every single
time. We want the automation to be smart
enough to know when a file is created in
that drive so that it pulls it to the
database. So the first step here is
Google Drive and the action is on
changes involving a specific folder. So
what this is is you're watching a
specific change within a folder and the
to change itself is a new file being
created. So all you have to do to
connect Google Drive to your Nit end is
go here and you need a client ID and
client secret. I would recommend
watching or asking the assistant exactly
step by step what you can do. It's more
of a longer process um but it's very
very easy. Let me know down below if you
want a full tutorial where I can show
you exactly how you can do it. Uh but
once you connected your Google Drive,
let me go here. [music] You'll have
this. Then it's asking you pull times.
This means how long or how often do you
want to run the automation. So in this
case we can do every minute which is
fine and trigger on changes involved in
folder. Okay that's fine because we want
to change we want to watch changes
inside a folder. The folder itself will
be rag example. So rag example
it's right here. And then what are we
watching for in this case? We're
watching for a file being created.
Right. So let me actually test this. Let
me fetch test event.
In this case,
I think the file was the one I pulled it
before, but let me do another one. So,
let me delete this
with the trash and let me put it back
here. So, I deleted one here. Every
minute, it runs and it checks that a new
document has been added. So, I can go
here, fetch test event, and this right
here has been added. And this will be
the file. So, let's see if that's the
file that we have, agency SOPs to PDF,
[music]
which is this one, right? And that's the
one that we're going to be adding to the
actual database. All right. So now we
have an automation set up where it
triggers whenever a file is created
inside of Google Drive. But how do we
actually send a document from Google
Drive to the vector database, right?
Well, in this case to send any documents
there, we have to download the file
first because the vector database only
gets or only intakes binary which I will
explain just a second. But the way that
we have to send the document in the
vector database is in a very very
specific format which is in the binary
format. So all we have to do here is
actually download the file before we
send it to the vector database. And to
download the file you have to press plus
go to drive and then you can download a
file right here connected which is the
same file download. And then the file we
don't want to select the file because we
want it to be dynamic. We want to change
every single time. And we can do ID and
the ID of the file will be the one here.
So let me go down to the ID. There we
go. And this is the ID of the file that
changes every single time because it's a
new file that we're doing. And that's
the thing that's going to be added to
the vector database. And if I go here,
let me just pin this, which means that I
will already have this input. I can I
don't have to rerun this. I can just use
this as test data. I can execute the
step. And I can see that we have binary
right here. This is exactly the type of
input or the type of thing that goes
into the vector database, which you
don't get in the previous one. So we
have to download it first. All right.
Now once we downloaded it we can go to
superbase because that's the software
that we're using to actually add a
document to superbase vector store add
documents to vector store because we're
adding a document and you'll come on
this page now once you come to this page
in order for us to connect your
superbase vector store I'm going to go
through everything step by step so we go
here create your credential and then the
service role secret which will be the
thing in superbase so let me go here let
me actually log out and make a new
account so you guys can see exactly what
it looks like sign up now Actually,
let me do my email
and then my password.
God, which is the same password I use
for every single email, which is not
good. Uh, sign up.
Check your email notification. So, this
is the email that I got. Confirm email
address. And this will be the account
that is just made for Superbase.
All you have to do is organization,
personal. There you go. Create
organization. And that's I just want to
walk you through step by step because
that's exactly what you have to do when
you do this. And you create create a new
project. Uh let me just let me just
cancel. [music] That's fine. So that's
it. So now actually we can create a new
project because we actually need this.
Uh let me do n
YouTube rag agent. The password is
not strong enough. create a new project.
And now we have the project that is
being added to Superbase. All right,
cool. So once you get to this page,
there's a few things we have to do. Now
the first thing we have to do is we have
to connect our Superbase to NN. And then
the second thing we have to do is
actually make the database that we add
the document to. So in order for us to
connect the NN, we have to have a
service ro secret. In order to have the
service ro secret, we have to go, I
believe, to project settings API keys.
There we go. Service ro secret. So we
can reveal. Let me just copy this. And
this is a thing that you want to paste
into any none [music] here. And you can
save it.
Couldn't connect with these settings.
Let's see why. Okay. And so the reason
why it says couldn't connect settings
cuz I'm missing my host, which I didn't
even see. Uh now, so to connect this
host, you have to go to superbase,
you have to go to, I believe, project
overview. Yep. And then down here, there
should be a project URL, which is this
one right here. You just copy. Go back
to NN, paste it. And now you can save
it. And now the connection is tested
successfully. And let me do N8N YouTube
uh 21st
August. Name your connections, right?
Cuz don't be like me. Save it. Okay. So
now that we connected our NN to
Superbase, we have to put operations
mode, which is insert document because
that's the thing that we're doing. We're
inserting a document into a database.
But the problem is there's no database
to add the documents to. So the next
step is this. All you have to do to
connect or to add a database is to go to
docs, scroll down to
uh where is it? Yeah, this one here. So
a quick start for setting up your back
to store. Press this. [music] You'll
come on this page. All you have to do
here, you just have to copy this, right?
And don't get overwhelmed. Just follow
me step by step. You go to superbase and
then you have to go to this right here,
SQL editor. Just paste this here.
Paste it. So you go like this and zoom
out. And now you will have this code
here. Now all you have to do is run it.
Once you run it on the bottom right, it
should say success. No rows [music]
returned. Okay. So once that's done,
once you actually made this on the table
editor, you can see that we just made a
table called documents. And this right
here is the database that we're going to
be adding the document to. So if I go
back to Nan, I can now choose refresh.
Let's refresh. actually cuz sometimes it
trips out and it takes a while to
actually update. I can go here and I
have documents now from the list and so
that's document that's the the place
where we actually get to store the
document in. If I go to options can
match the options Mac documents and
leave this as is and the embedding match
size is 200 which is fine. And now in
order for us to actually make it work we
have to connect two different things.
The first one is the embedding which is
what is that AI or I mentioned before
that we have to take the file and turn
it into different numbers. So we have to
use AI for this which in this case we
could use openAI right here and we can
leave this as text embedding 3 small
again to connect your OpenAI to NN all
you have to do is get the API key which
you can find on platform.opai.com
open.com. Let me go here. Let me
actually show you. Apart from the
open.com, you log in dashboard. On the
left hand side, you have API keys.
Create a secret key. Name it whatever
you want. So, let's do nitn test
>> YouTube
secret key. Copy this.
And now we can go to nitn. We can paste
this. Name this test August 19th. Oh
god. test August 19th. We can save this
and now the connection is done. Okay,
that's how you connect your OpenAI to an
event. Um, and now for the model itself,
you want to connect this to text
embedding three small. It doesn't really
matter. Um, just do this one. This is
the fastest and probably the most
efficient for now. And this is the thing
again that's going to take the file,
turn it into numbers to then add it to
the database. And now for us to actually
add a document, we have to do the
default data loader. So it loads data
from previous steps into the workflow.
So let me go here. I can press this
[music] and in this case we don't want
to do JSON but I mentioned before that
we want to do it as a binary which means
that it's asking us what is that type of
file what is the type of input that we
give you in this case it's binary so
load all data input yes that's fine
automatically detected
yes that's fine and simple is fine
that's all good is there anything we
want no that's it okay so in this case
data format automatically detected by
time text splitting is simple and that's
all you have to do now this right here
just means it splits every thousand
characters within a 200 100 character
overlap. So before if you saw the PDF
was actually stored into 10 different
rows, 11 different rows. It's because it
actually split it up. So this right here
is used then it goes here to the
embeddings turns the file into the
embedding and then in order for us to
actually store the document we have to
use this one right here. So let's test
this. Let's test this right here. Let me
go to unpin this.
Let me go to Google Drive. Let me just
[music] reput another one.
So piece replace
the file. I can go back to NN. And now
if I execute the workflow, it should
work. Let me go here. Download the file.
It goes here. Okay. Everything was
successful. And if I go to NN YouTube
agent, I can see that the data was
stored here. And the data has the ID
which is just the rows, right? Every
every new every new entry is one. And
then content, which is this, just a
bunch of text. Metadata, which is JSON.
which is a bunch of stuff as well.
Embedding which is again the thing that
I mentioned which is the different
numbers. These are the vectors which
might look a bit intimidating at the
start. Uh but these are the series of
numbers that we have that are stored in
the vector database which is the thing
that's going to allow us to actually ask
it questions. All right. So once this is
done we have to go here and we can get
on to the second agent because the
second agent is what the real source is
about because we can actually ask it any
questions about the document. So we can
keep this on the same workflow. So let
me save this. Right here we have upload
a document, download it and then add it
to the database. Now we can start by
actually querying the superbase. So for
us to actually create the superbase, if
you really think about it, we have to
text the agent. In order for us to make
a text agent, we just have to add an AI
agent which will
go here. And then we just have to
connect it to a chat trigger, which
means that we have a chat connected to
the agent. So we can talk to the agent.
All right. So there's a few things. Uh
the chat agent. So this right here, I
can just talk to it, right? And it will
send the information and it will send it
here. It will do whatever. And then we
have the AI agent. In the AI agent, the
source for prompt, meaning what is the
input? In this case, it's just connected
to the chat trigger node because this is
the chat trigger node. We can leave this
as is. The prompt is fine. Uh require
specific output format. No, we don't.
And now it's asking us to do a system
message. So that's the thing that you
want to add to the AI agent.
Let me go here expressions so I can do
it full screen and now I can start
adding the prompt. Now for the prompt
itself we usually use a structure which
is overview
tools
and then rules
right for overview we can say you are a
helpful intelligent
uh information
extracting
I don't know if that makes sense but
extracting assistant that helps me to
answer or the answers
any queries
that come to you.
Okay, that's fine. For the tools itself,
um we have to add and then for the rules
we can add as well later. So overview
you're a helpful intelligent information
system answers my any queries that come
to you and then tools we can add the
tool in this case we only have one which
is getting the uh superbase for the
effective database and then we have the
rules if I go here we can now connect
this to a chat model which in this case
we can do openi you can't see it right
now cuz my face is there but openi chat
model is here can press this and now
again we already connected openai to nnn
so we just have the connection here in
the model leave this as 4.1 bin we don't
have to connect memory or actually no we
have to or we can right we can uh for
simple memory just so that it actually
remembers the previous questions that we
asked it we can leave this as this this
is fine and now this is asking how many
past interactions does the model receive
as context five is fine you can add more
if you want in case you're having longer
conversations where it needs to remember
what you said before and now for the
real source of the AI agent it's the
superbase so if I go here superbase
vector store you can see that now the
tool is this one here so let's first
let's rename this do vector
store
rename. If I go in here, I can then have
different settings. The first setting is
obviously the connection which we
already made before. Then the operation
which is what is that thing that we're
doing in this case is retrieving
documents as tool for AI agent which is
fine. Again we previously we had insert
documents. The description is you can
just leave this as work with data from
the superbase
vector database rhymes. [music] And now
the title the table is a database right
that is a thing that we just made this
one here. So if I go here and I go to it
only gives me one option because we only
have one table documents. The limit is
fine include metadata. Actually I don't
this says number of top results to fetch
the I don't think we need a limit. I
think we can just not have not have one
because it can pull any any any number
of results. Include metadata. What is
this? Whether or not to include document
metadata, it's fine. All right. So now
we can connect this to an embedding
because just like we did this above, we
need to embed which means that we need
to turn our question into numbers so
that it can ask it any questions on a
vector database. So we can go here
embedding. And by the way, you can
connect this to the same one, right? But
to make it less complicated, we just
have our own. Uh so let's go here.
Embeddings open AAAI. Leave this as
before, which is fine. And now this is
embedded. So in theory now when we ask
any questions, it will go to the AI
agent. It will think through it it's uh
its brain, which is the LM. It will
remember any conversation that we had.
But most importantly, it will send the
information here first. It will embed
it. So it will turn it our questions
into numbers. It will then match it up
against any numbers that we have, any
vectors that we have in the vector
database. It will then send us back an
answer in natural language, right? Like
[music] before like I showed you. Now
one thing I need to finish is the
prompt. So let me go here and let me go
up here. And now for the tools we have
vector store. Very important that you
name the tool the same as the tool that
you actually have. What I mean by this
is like vector store needs to be the
same name as this. If I rename this to
something else like vector store, make
sure to update that into the prompt,
especially when you have more tools. So,
vector store, this will always
be used when
answering any questions
that the user
might have.
Now, rules. The only rule I have is
actually I have two rules. The first one
is you must always
pull information from this from the
vector store. Um that's it. And then
your answers
need to be concise and to the point.
Uh okay. So why do I say this will
always be used? Because previously when
I actually made the this agent uh I was
asking it a question. it was using like
the natural LLM to actually answer it
like what what is a project management
tool that we're using. It will use the
LLM to search in the internet or search
through like its own its own storage.
But in this case, we only wanted to pull
information from the vector store. Okay,
that's why we're saying this. And then
we always we always want the answer to
be concise because I don't want it to
give me a full paragraph um or a long
long paragraph that we can't read. All
right, so I think that's it. Now we can
test this and if it goes wrong, we can
uh we can obviously change it. So let me
go here. Let me say let me go here. Let
me [music] get something specific. What
are the things that are included in the
content production? [music]
That's it. And it should say video,
social media, copyrightiting.
So we go what is included
in our content production.
So what it's doing now is it's going to
embed our answer. It's then going to
query with the vector database, give us
back an answer. And now it says that we
have video production, social media and
copyrightiting. And if I go here again I
can see video, social media and
copyrightiting.
So let me ask another question. So let's
say I want to ask it what is inside
content I mean the social media. So say
what is inside
social media.
What it should say now is that we have
content calendar managed in notion post
schedule one a week.
Content calendar is managed in notion
post schedule once a week. Right? as
this is insane especially if you have
hundreds and hundreds of documents
inside the vector database which allow
you to pull information from these uh
documents in in a matter of seconds cuz
typically when I worked with agencies
especially creative agencies or any type
of agencies we worked with a lot of them
they store their SOPs into a Google
document into multiple Google documents
with tabs and in order for them to
actually ask any questions about the
actual document they have to go inside
the document itself to get any answer
but in this case we just have a chat AI
agent
queries itself and then gives us back an
answer in very very simple way in just
seconds. So that right there is a full
build for the rank agent inside of N&N
that allows us to search through
hundreds of documents that we have. In
this case I only used one but imagine
you can add multiple hundreds of
documents inside of Google Drive which
will pull it into the vector database
and then we can just ask it any
questions that we want.
Hey, in this video I'm going to show you
how I built an AI support agent for an
e-commerce store that automatically
pulls in queries, classifies a query,
then searches through a directed
database for answers, drafts an email
reply before alerting our team to review
the email and send it. Now, for
businesses who receive a large amount of
emails from customers asking questions,
at least 90% of them are the same. These
systems are amazing just because they
save that time that you can now devote
to actually growing the business. All
right, so I'm actually going to test it
before I even explain exactly what
everything does, just so you get to see
the final outcome. So, I'm going to send
myself an email saying question about
the return policy. [music] All right.
So, I asked the return policy plus the
shipping location. Uh, I'm going to say
thanks in advance. And you press send.
Now, this right here will send it to the
base email. So, this will be in theory
the email that receives all the incoming
queries from all the customers. As you
can see, we just got the email. I go
here. I'm going to execute the workflow.
So, this is going to run. Is that going
to classify the email? It's going to
then pull the answer from the reged
database. It's going to drop an email
and then it's going to send us a message
on Telegram informing us that a new
inquiry came through. We have to review
it and actually send the email. As you
can see in Telegram, we said new inquiry
received from the name about is the
question of the actual the subject line
and then the action is email drafted to
your email. So they know exactly that
they have to go to their email and
actually look at the email before
sending it. And if I go to my email
here, I can see that on drops I have one
new dropped. You can see that we have
the return policy. We have the shipping
locations and James Noble Mart customer
service team. All right, perfect. All
right, cool. So, let's go through the
whole process step by step. Now you have
an idea of what it actually does. Takes
emails or takes emails from with
questions. It then looks through our
vector database which is a database that
has different um the different documents
and then sends back an email reply and
then informs the [music] team to then go
in drafts and actually send it to the
customer. All right. So, the first step
here is actually incoming emails. So,
this will be the trigger on any incoming
emails that come through. In this case,
we have an inbox and for any businesses
really, they have inboxes like um a
company name support.com and that's the
inbox that they use to answer any
incoming FAQs. So, they have this and
this would be the domain or the actual
inbox that we use to collect and then
run the automation for the first step.
So, in order to connect our Gmail, we
have to go here obviously choose the
Gmail trigger
cing credential and then you can sign in
with Google and take you through the
whole process. Uh it's very very easy
just as a regular sign in with Google
sort of thing. And then it's asking us
for the poll times. The poll times says,
"Hey, we're looking at your email, but
how often do you want us to go through
your email to make sure that we have all
the questions?" In this case, you can
put minute, hour, day, week, month,
every x custom. But I think every minute
is fine. It depends on the amount of
queries that they get. So I would ask
the business, hey, how many queries do
you get a month? How many queries do you
get a day? If they say, hey, we get
about a thousand a day or 100 a day,
whatever it is, maybe we can run it
every hour or every every 5 minutes,
right? But speed speed to lead and speed
to questions is important because that
builds up the brand and it just makes a
part of better impact on the customer as
well. So we can obviously do every
minute every hour and with so again it
depends on on the amount of inquiries
that they get. Then we have the event.
So the event is hey what has happened
like what is the thing that we're
watching for in this case is a message
[music] received which is the only
option here right and then simplify
which is fine uh because you just want
to keep it simple with uh with the way
that the [music] the actual note is set
up. Once this is done, right, which is
the again the email trigger. So I can
actually fetch test event. I believe
that we have Yeah, we don't have any
emails anymore. Um, let me actually send
myself an email so we can we can test
this 100. Hello.
Hey, I need to know the shipping policy
you have.
I send it now. I don't have to wait. Of
course, when you have to run this for a
customer, you have to automatically run
this every 1 minute. But for this case,
we just have to test. Um, so I'm just
going to send it to myself and wait for
the email to come back. As you can see,
we got the email here. If I go here, I
can fetch test event and we get the
snippet, which is the email body, which
is in this case is, hey, I need to know
the shipping policy you have. And that's
the thing that's going to be sent to the
next uh step to actually classify
whether this is a promotional thing or
an actual FAQ. So the next step here
actually before we get to this point is
we have to set the variable. Now, why do
we do this is because when we look at
all these, we can get a bit overwhelmed
and we don't really know where the where
the actual text is. So, we just want to
basically make it as simple as possible
for the next steps to pull in
information from Gmail. So, we add in a
set node which you can find here. So,
set node edit field set. This allows us
to just pull in variables from a list of
variables. In this case, it's just
snippet. And we call this email body and
call it whatever we want. Basically,
this makes it so much easier for the
next steps to actually pull in
information from Gmail without having to
go through all these different pieces of
information. Once this is done, we go to
classify emails. Now, we have to have
this step because not all emails are
FAQs. Some are promotional, some are
just general emails. In this case, we
just wanted to check whether they are
promotional or silver service. So, if I
go in here, and this, by the way, is
text classifier
right here. Text classifier. This allows
us to classify text based on specific um
you know rules. So go in here text to
classify will be the JSON email bodies.
So let me actually run the previous
steps. Let me go here and pin so I don't
have to rerun the whole email. Let me
actually execute step. As we can see we
have hey I need to know the shape and
policy you have. And this will be the
thing that we then pull here saying hey
classify this text. Now here's where we
start adding the categories. So the
categories like what are we classifying
it for? like what are what are the what
are the rules and what is what's the
logic here in this case we have
promotional we have support service now
to add a category you have to press this
button right here you can put the name
so in this case let's do support service
and then description is hey this is the
name of the of the actual rule or the
category this is the description of what
it is so in this case for promotion we
said marketing offers discount sales
pages newsletters which are typical sort
of promotional emails and then we have
support service which is customer
increase troubleshooting complaints or
help requests that's the only two
categories that the classified email
node or the text specifier will take
into account when it needs to look at
the the inquiry that came through from
the customer and classify as to whether
they are one or the other. Then we have
options. So system prompt which is
basically saying hey please classify the
emails provided by the user into one of
the following categories categories
right here just so it knows that these
are the categories and user provided
formatting instructions uh below don't
explain and only output the JSON. I
believe that this is a standard prompt.
Yeah, it is a standard prompt. So you
can just add this um but this allows the
the actual node to be more strict and
understand exactly what it is. Now in
order for this to actually work this
doesn't just work on its own. It works
with AI. Let's say we have to go here
the model. to choose a model here and we
have all these models. I typically go
for the OpenAI chat model because it is
the I go for quality plus uh plus price.
I think this is fine. Connect it. To
connect to your OpenAI, you just have to
go to platform.openai.com.
Go to the dashboard. Go to the API keys.
Create a new secret key and then you can
put your name and then create a secret
key and then bring it back here to paste
it. Don't worry about the organization
ID. You don't need it. And as well this
don't worry about this. Uh, one
important thing here is that for a
company to run this, they do have to pay
for the credits which you find in your
profile
and you find it here. But obviously
would look into how many increase they
get and then make the price based on
that. But the price is like 1/10enth of
a cent per per run. All right. And now
that we connected AI, what this happens,
so how this works is we have the email
body which is incoming emails. It will
then go here saying, "Hey, can you
classify this using AI?" Right? It will
have categories. It will have strict
rules. it will talk to the AI to make
sure that that's how it thinks. That's
that's that's the actual like program.
Uh and then based on the the two
different sides, we have promotional,
support service. In this case, we
actually didn't put anything for
promotional. So if something is
promotional, it just stops there. We
don't want to really do anything with
it. Uh we only want to send it through
if it's a support service. So that's why
we drag this across and we put it to the
next node. Uh which in this case is an
AI agent, which is really the the main
source of the whole system. And so once
we classify the emails we say, "Hey,
okay, this is an FAQ. This is like
actually something that we can answer,
let's go out and actually review and
draft an email for the customer using
the data that we have. Now, if you
haven't checked out my AI rag agent
system, then make sure to check it out
right here on the top or below. It'll
show you exactly how we set this up step
by step. So you get to see the whole
process. But essentially what it is,
it's an AI agent that gets incoming
emails. In this case, it gets the the
inquiry from here, which is the same
input as this. But now we know that it's
support service because we went through
the step. And what it will do is I will
go through a back to database. Now, a
back to database is something that looks
like this, which is composed of
different rows. These rows come from
this document. Okay. So, we have a
document, which is essentially where all
the information is stored. So, account
login, all the different FAQ questions
that people usually ask, which is
typically what a company would have in
the first place. And then now we
basically transform this into vector
database or embeddings in this case we
call them that will allow the the
program to actually take the question
that's coming through match it up
against any of this embeddings and then
give us back an answer in the simplest
way. So the way to do this is we have an
AI agent right here the prompt which is
the user message. This right here will
say hey what is the thing that we're
fitting into uh the AI agent in this
case is email received which you can
find from the email body right here. So
this right here will be the the from
because when we actually have to drop
the email we have to know who the email
is coming from and the name as well just
so we can personalize the email plus
send it to the right person and that's
about it for the user message. In this
case we don't require any specific
output format. We don't enable any
fallback method. This just means do you
want it in a very in a in a specific
format like JSON or anything like that.
We don't want to do any of that. And
also do we want to enable a fallback
method. This means that if OpenAI does
not work you want to use another AI to
to test. In this case, you could or
could not put this on. I mean, typically
I wouldn't have it on because the chat
model right here works fine. Um, but you
can have it on even to be more safe.
Now, the system message here is a system
uh or is the message that we tell the
system like, hey, you are a helpful
intelligent XYZ that does a few things.
So, the prompt for the AI agent follows
through a very very specific structure
that we use for most of the AI agents
that we build. In this case, it has an
overview. So, you are helpful assistant
that answers any inquiries from our
e-commerce store called Novart. You'll
[music] be dropping email replies for
the incoming queries that come through.
And then tools, this will be the tools
that the AI agent is connected to. In
this case, it's two. The first one is
pulling in information from the document
that we have, which is the one right
here, which not right now is stored in
the vector database in superbase. And
the second one is the email draft,
right? Because this tool will be used to
draft any emails back to the user to
make sure that they have the
corresponding answers based on the
information that comes from the vector
store. Some rules here is we have to
always use the vector store before
answering any questions and droting any
emails. This is very very important
because sometimes what the AI could do
is that it can drop the email but it
will not have any context or any
information that's actually valuable for
the end user uh to give them an answer.
So it's sort of saying hey what is the
return policy? I reply to you first and
then I go out and look for the
information. We have to make the order
actually make sense which is why we tell
you hey look for the information first
and then you can go and drop an email
and then some extra information. My name
is James. Make sure to include that when
dropping an email because at the end um
what it did basically in the email it
said hey thank you uh this comes from
add your name like bracket add your name
and then uh it will put the put the
actual company name in this case we want
to put James because again that's that's
reality of what emails look like they
put names instead of just adding
variables uh so we give it that context
as well all right once this is done then
we have the chat model in this case we
can add here same way as we did before
we can go to open AI and we have to
connect to our account and use 4.1 mini.
Again, this is perfect uh perfectly fine
for for this use case. Now, what we have
to do is connect to tools. Now, the way
that an AI agent works is that it gets
it gets the inquiry. So, it gets an
input like, hey, dropped an email or
hey, look for this information or do
something and it will then think through
what it needs to do using its model and
then to take action what it actually
needs to do, it uses tools. So, in this
case, because we have two tools again,
one for the draft and one ones for the
vector database that actually looks for
the information. We connect these tools
to the corresponding softwares. [music]
In this case, to connect it to the
vector store, we have to go here. In
this case, well, I mean, it's vector
store, so you have to press plus. Let me
see if I can move this. There you go.
Uh, superbase superbase vector store and
you'll come to this page. Once you get
to that page, so let me delete this.
You'll be here. The first thing you have
to do is create a new credential. And
again, you should have a service ro
secret and a host, which you can find
here. And then we have this page right
here. The first thing you have to do is
obviously make the account. Then you
have to make the database. And again, I
put a whole video on how to do this down
below. So, make sure to check it out.
And now we have to go back here, go to
the API keys, and [music] you can then
reveal, copy the secret, and paste it
here. And then you can press save. And
then you're done. All right, cool. So
once we are done with this, we can then
use the operation mode. Again, operation
in any to end just means what is the
thing that we want to do. In this case,
is retrieve documents as tool for AI
agent. There's a different options here.
And now the description is work with
data inside the vector database to
answer any questions, which is fine. Let
me delete the extra e [music] right
here. Um, and then the table name which
will be the table here, right here.
Table editor. Yeah, this will be the one
that's containing different information.
As you can see, we have no mart
e-commerce general information. We have
go to your cart xyz. All the different
information that it needs to use in
order to then answer any incoming
queries. [music] And once that's done,
we have the limit. Again, actually, I
don't know why I put this to four. Uh,
this basically says the number of
results fetched from the vector store. I
typically will leave it blank. Uh in
this case of course if you have a really
really large vector database and you
don't put a limit it will basically
[music] use more credits than if you put
a limit on x amount. Uh so that's why we
add a limit here and then we include
metadata and then we have to put the
query name which is match documents
which is the database that we're using.
All right then we have the embeddings
which are a way for openi to take the
incoming query like hey what's the
return policy turn that into numbers so
that it can match them to the embedding.
Again, this will make much more sense
once you see the video uh of me creating
the AI rag agent and the fundamentals
behind what it is. But in a very simple
way is that text is turned to numbers.
Numbers will match numbers to give you
an answer. Um to do this we have to uh
put the embedding which in this case is
another LLM and we can use OpenAI
connect to OpenAI. You can leave the
model to text embedding 3 small. All
right. All right, once the vector store
tool is finished and we now can look for
the information in the vector database,
we can now connect the second tool which
is the email drop because again the
sequential order goes in the vector
database to find the email or to find
the information in this case sorry and
then go to the email to then drop the
email to give an answer to the customer.
So in this case we have to use an email
draft. You can go here Gmail tool and
you come on this page you have to
connect your email. So is the same exact
process as the one before create your
credential and then you can set it with
Google and then you have to use a tool
description. So the tool description you
can set automatically the resource which
would be uh what is the thing we're
doing in this case it's not label it's
not message and it's not thread it's
draft and then the action that we're
taking is we're creating a draft and the
subject line something good and it has
is that we can actually let the AI
define this define this parameter which
is the subject line of the email and
then the email type which would be text
then we have the message which is the
email body and we can also press the
button right here which will let the
model define this parameter which is
amazing because we don't have to do
anything and also on top of that we also
have to send the email to someone. So we
have to press to add option [music] to
email. So who are we sending the email
to? And then the info@ample.com
will be replaced by the email that we
mentioned that we're giving the AI agent
to take action. So we can just press
this and now the AI will already have be
smart enough to be able to think about
who are we sending the email to based on
the input that it was given. All right.
[music]
So let's put this to test. Let's see how
it actually works. Um I think we can
just Yeah, I think we can just test
this. Yeah. Let me go here. Here I'm
going to press this button right here
which just test this right here. It will
classify it. We'll say it's a port
service. Now what it will do is it will
look through the back to store. But
again first of all the first step is it
will think through its memory or its LLM
um its brain to then think about what it
needs to do. So the first step is
finished and then the second step is
drafting an email and then it goes back
and it thinks through before it gets to
the next steps which is Telegram in this
case. But before we get to that, let's
look at the draft of the email. Let me
go here. Go to draft refresh. Then the
shipping policy tells me all of this.
Now one thing we want to change ideally
is maybe the size of the length of the
email. I think this is pretty long. Uh
so to do that to make any changes you
can go here and then the rules
make the email
draft a medium length
keeping it concise [music]
with a good structure.
So, let me test this again. Let's see if
anything changed. And this is how you
usually go about iterating and and
making sure that the AI agent does what
you want it to do in the in the best way
possible. Now, if we go back here, you
can see that we made another email,
which is more structured. Maybe the size
isn't yes, it's not shorter, but the
structure is better, I'll say. So, now
we can say and we can leave this as
this. To be honest, if I was a if I was
a customer, I would want some sort of
answer like this that would give me the
best information with all the prices and
stuff. Cool. All right. Um, and again
all the information comes from here. So
the shipping policy and options comes
from here which it pulls information
from. All right. Now once this is done,
we can then go to the last step which is
basically informing the team. Now why do
we do this is because the email again
you saw it wasn't it wasn't sent to the
customer. It was dropped. We have to
notify someone that they have to go to
the inbox and actually send the email to
the customer if they like it. So that's
why the last step is Telegram which is
send a text message which you can find
right here. Telegram. send a text
message right here and then to connect
it you have to create a new credential
you have to get the access token if I go
to ask AI start a new session now this
will tell me the step by step and I
recommend you guys always use this sort
of feature when you're not really sure
as to how to do it h because it is
better than chat GBT because what this
does is that it actually looks at the
end to end community it looks at the
different questions and it'll give you a
step by step as to how to do it so the
first step is start a chat with the
botfather and then you do different
steps until you get the actual access
token right so once Once you connect to
your telegram, you can go here. The
resource again is message because we're
not drafting or chat or fallback or
file. We're just sending a simple
message. The operation is what is the
action that you're taking. In this case,
we're sending a message. The chat ID is
something that you can actually take.
Um, so let me let me show you. Let me
execute the step
right here. So, I executed the step.
Now, if I go to Telegram, I should see
the message. Let me show you right here.
I just got another message at 350.
And now in theory this will give me a
chat ID. So if I go here chat ID, this
is the chat ID that will be used to then
send the the text to. This is great
because the chat ID allows it to give
[music] us the the answers in the same
thread of information or or conversation
in this case. All right. Now once this
is done, we have the chat ID. Now we
have to put the text. So what is the
thing that we're putting in the message?
Well, in this case, I thought that it'd
be good to add new inquiry received from
the name of the person and also the
about which is a subject line. Uh you
could in theory change this and add more
stuff but I thought that this would be
the most relevant to have for this agent
uh as a text message. Um so we have new
inquiry received from name about subject
line here and then the action it says
email drafted to your email. So again if
you saw on telegram that the message
itself was email drafted go to the email
informing someone they know the name
they know the the about like the actual
question and they can then go out and
send the email.
Hey, I'm about to build a live invoicing
parsing system right in front of you
that grabs invoices from a Google Drive,
uses AI to extract all the key data,
stores it in a Google sheet before
sending an email to our billing team
once it's done. Now, this kind of system
can actually save companies hundreds of
hours of processing documents. In this
case, it's invoices, which they can now
devote to actually growing the business.
So, today I'm going to build a whole
system from scratch using a platform
called N8N. I'm going to show you all
the mistakes, all the detours I make
that you get to see what an actual
development process for a real client
project actually looks like. All right.
So, this right here is the edit end
workflow that we're going to work with.
Uh, we start with Google Drive. So, in
this case, I go to my Google Drive. I
drop in an invoice that I have, one of
the hundreds that I have right now. I go
to the invoice. I can see that I have
different fields in the invoice. Company
name, uh, address, email, line item,
price, currency, payment method, invoice
number, date, and status. Right? So,
these are different fields that I have
within the invoice. If I go here to the
first Google Drive, I'm here and execute
the workflow. What this will do is it
will take the invoice that we just gave
it. It will then extract the text from
the invoice. It will give it to an AI
which will check the different variables
that we need from the invoice like
client name, address, all that sort of
stuff. It adds it to a Google sheet
database. It then drops an AI to address
an email using AI and then sends it to
us as well. If I go to my Google sheet
database, I can see that now the invoice
was parsed. So the different variables
have been extracted. If I go to my email
right here, I can see that I got an
email saying dear building team, you
have received a new invoice and it gives
me the different details. And it says
the system has added the fields in the
Google sheet database which you can also
view here. If I go here, takes me to the
Google sheet database with all the line
items there. All right. So, that right
there is for the system we're going to
build from scratch. Again, I'm going to
start from zero, completely zero. So,
I'm going to show you the whole
development process. Let me go to a new
a new workflow right here. We can start
from scratch. The first thing we have to
do is actually map out the process of
the automation on a platform called
Miro. You can use any other platform for
this. Uh, but I like using Miro uh
because it is very very easy. All right.
So the first part or the first the
thought process here is we have a bunch
of invoices. Then we have to so let's do
invoices.
Then we have to basically extract the
text or extract different variables.
Extract variables
from invoice. And by variables we mean
client name, client address, all that
sort of stuff. And then we want to add
it
to a database. When someone says
database they just mean a Google sheet
or table, notion, clickup, whatever it
is. And then after we add to the
database, we want to send an email. So
send email to billing team confirming
invoice. All right. I mean it is a
four-step process. As you saw, it was
more than four steps just because of the
way we had it set up. Uh but this is
fundamentally what it is that we're
doing, right? We're watching new
invoices from somewhere. We're
extracting the variables. We're saying,
"Hey, okay, what is the client name?
What is the account address? What is the
price? What is the currency?" All that
sort of stuff. And then we're adding it
to a database. And then we're sending
the building team. We're sending an
email to the building team confirming
the invoice. Now, typically when I do
something like this, I'll think through
how to structure it. So, the first step
is invoices. As you saw, we used the
Google Drive because that is the easiest
to get started with. So, we can say
watch invoices
from Google Drive. And what this could
look like is we run the automation maybe
once a day or once an once a minute uh
every minute, I mean, every hour or
every week. And we watch new invoices
that have been added so that we it's a
continuous thing. Uh, and that's always
good because we don't want to have a
system where there has to be a manual
step of running the automation every
single time. We want it to be automatic
so that they can just drop invoices and
every so often it takes invoices and
then does the whole process. Uh, then
extract the variables from the invoice,
adds it to a database, uh, in this case
Google sheet. Add variables
to Google sheet
and then send the email to the billing
team confirming the invoice. All right.
So the first step is Google Drive. So
what is the first step is always the
trigger. So what is the thing that
actually starts the automation? In this
case, every new client that has or every
new file that has been added, every new
invoice that has been added every so
often will be the thing that starts the
automation. Um so if I go to Google
Drive and I go to on changes to a
specific folder because we're adding
invoices to a folder, I can see that the
change that we want to make is actually
when a file has been created, when a
file has been added. Um, so first the
first thing you have to do is go here,
create your credential, and you have to
um connect your Google Drive to Nitn.
Now, I'm not going to dive into this
whole process right now, but I actually
made a full step-by-step video on how
you can do it within less than 5
minutes. Uh, you can check it out on the
screen right now. Uh, but once you
connect to your Google Drive, you'll
have a connection right here, which is
good. The pull times just means how many
times or how often do you want to run
the Google Drive. In this case, it can
be every minute. Then the trigger on
just means what do you want the trigger
to be? Do you want it to be just changes
involving a specific folder, every file?
In this case, it will be a folder
because we need a folder to include the
invoices in. And then we have to make a
folder. So, let's go to Google Drive. I
can go here. I can make a new folder. I
can call it invoices test YouTube
create.
And now this created a folder which I
can find here. Now, this is a place
where we're going to store all the
invoices to be processed every every so
often. Um, okay cool. So now, uh,
obviously make sure that your connection
is correct. In this case, it actually
should be James Solutions, not Nika
connection. That's a different, uh,
account. And the folder in this case is
invoices, test YouTube. So invoices test
YouTube. Okay. And then it says, what
are we watching for in this case, are we
watching for a file to be created,
updated, created, uh, folder created,
folder updated, watch folder updated.
Well, in this case, we want to do when a
folder is created within a folder. So
when a file is created within a folder.
So in this case it would be when a file
is created in the watched folder which
is this folder right here. So let me go
here do file created. So now this
watches every new file that has been
added. So let's try it out. Let's test
because part of automation is testing. I
want to have an invoice that I have
right now. So you can drop your invoices
here and I'm going to test if uh now
that added here if I execute workflow.
So in this case if I fetch test event I
created will this catch the invoice that
has been added? Well in this case yes.
So this is the output. If I scroll all
the way down, I can actually find the
link which is a web view link of the
invoice that has been added which is
correct which is the same one that has
been added here because it basically
caught all the files from there that has
been added. It's only one. All right,
perfect. So we know it works. Um so the
first step is done right right here is
finished.
So we watched invoices from Google
Drive. That's good. Now the next step is
to extract
text from a file. So let me go here.
Extract from file, extract from PDF
because the invoices itself are on PDF
version. So it depends what kind of PDF
or what kind of file you have. Now here
it says extract from PDF which is a
thing that we have to do uh because
that's the action that we're doing. But
then it says the input. So the thing
that's going in to this node right here
which extract text from PDFs has to be
in the form of binary. [music] Now, in
order for us to get the file to be added
here, we have to do an additional step,
which is actually downloading the file
to then being adding it to the to this
node right here because it only likes
binary format. And the only way to get
binary format is to download the file.
So, if I go here to Google Drive,
I can now download a file. Press this
button right here. Make sure you have
the right connection.
File, download. That's fine. Uh, and now
we want to actually do it by the ID
because if you do it by the list, then
you only have access to one file. We
don't want to keep downloading the same
file. We want to change the file that
we're downloading. So the files itself
all have an ID that's unique. So if we
map the ID, if we put the ID that's
different every single time, it will
download every single file differently,
which is exactly what we need. If I go
here, I can put ID. So we can find the
ID. And now the ID will actually be
here. It always, it usually starts with
one uh Y. You can see here ID um one Y
whatever. So this will be the one that
we map that we add here to be able to
download it. Now if I just execute the
step I can now see that I got binary
format data which is a thing that we
need in order to add it to the next
step. And this is the data we got. Okay.
So you always need that additional step
when you're actually doing something
with Google Drive folder. It's usually
downloading it and then turning it into
a binary format when you have to do
something with it. Now in this case um
the input binary format field is fine
data because this is equal to data. So
that's fine. We can execute the step.
We're actually testing. As you can see
here there's a lot of fields. The one we
really care about is text right here
which gives me the company name, invoice
number, customer name, date, company
name, all that sort of stuff that we
need in order to actually split it up
and add it to the Google sheet. So the
next step is actually extracting the
variables within the text. Because it's
a block of text. How do we split it up?
So we get the customer ID, the customer
name, the email, the address, all that
sort of stuff that we actually need in
order to add it to the Google sheet.
Well, in this case, you can press plus.
We have to go to information extractor.
Now, what this does is that it receives
text to the actual thing. It then think
through what the text is about and then
based on the descriptions of the line
items or variables that we tell it to to
give us, it will then split up the text.
So it gives us the the customer name,
the address, the the invoice ID, all
that sort of stuff that we need. Um,
okay. So the text here will be the text
from the previous step. So I can across
right here and again you can also see
the result which is something that any
actually does really well. Uh you can
see the output before you even test the
schema type will be from attribute
descriptions. Don't worry about this.
You can leave it as it is. And now we
have to add attributes. So attributes
just means what is that thing that we
want to extract from the text. In
[music] this case there's a few things.
So if I go here and I look at the
invoice again this would be different
for sort of every company. It's sort of
similar. You still have the price the
invoice number all that sort of stuff.
uh but sometimes we do have something
called statuses or payment methods um
that we want to account for. So in this
case it will be customer name. So we can
do customer name.
This is the name of the customer.
So right here it's asking us what type
of output is it? Is it a string? Is it a
boolean which is true or false? Is it
date? Is it a number? In this case a
string is just text like the normal
version. So leave it as it is. And then
description is us giving it a
description. So it actually helps it in
thinking what is the customer name um
and so on and then we can put a required
so it needs to give us the output.
Then we have uh from here company name
address and email. So company
name this is the name of the company
required
email
this is the email of the customer
address as well.
So address
this is the address of the customer.
All right. Then we have invoice number,
date and status.
Invoice number,
date,
status.
Invoice number is this is the
number of the invoice required. Now this
right here for date we can actually turn
it into a date format and we say this is
the date of the invoice required and
then status will be this is the status
of the payment required and then we have
line items. So line items this is like
this the description of the payment the
price and payment method. Price and
payment method. Uh line item.
This is the line item of the invoice.
Price the total amount.
This is
total amount of the invoice
and then payment method.
This is the payment method.
of the invoice. All right. So, I just
finished filling out all the forms, all
the details in the in the actual
invoice. We have customer name, we have
a company name, we have email, we have
address, we have invoice number, we have
date, and again we turn this to date
because it is a date format, um [music]
status, line item, total amount, payment
method, and so on. Okay. All right. Now,
what we have to do here is we have to do
two things. The first thing is to give
it a system prompt template. In this
case, it's you are an expert extraction
algorithm. They only extract relevant
information from the text. If you do not
know the value of an attribution as to
extract um you may omit the attributes
value. I think this is pretty good. I
think we don't need to give it any more
context. Now, one more thing we have to
do because this does not run on its own.
This runs through AI. So, we have to
connect a model to it. So, if I press
here, I have a list of models that I can
choose. In this case, I'm choosing
OpenAI chat model. And I will come to
this page. The way to connect your
OpenAI to Nitn, you can go here, create
a new credential. You can go to platform
to OpenAI because you have to get an API
key dashboard API key. Create a new
secret key. Name it. So you can do
invoice system.
Create a secret key. You can copy this.
Go back. Paste it here. And then name
this whatever it is. So 5th September
connection save it and now you will have
your OpenAI connected to Nitan. Bear in
mind that this is not free as in you
still have to pay for this in a sense.
So you go to your profile and you go to
billing you have to add $5 because we're
using API credits and API credits costs
money. Uh but is very very minimal as in
I think I used $5 in 6 months. Um and I
was using it quite a bit. So obviously
it depends what you use it for as well
but it's relatively cheap. So you can
add $5 and you'll have that last you for
a while. All right. So now that we have
that the model can be 4.1 mini. It's
good, good quality and good speed. We
can actually extract this. So let me run
this. This uses the previous steps to
test only this step. If I go here, I can
see that I extracted uh the comp name,
the company name, the email, the
address, the invoice number, date,
status, line item, total amount, and
payment method, which is amazing, which
is exactly what we need. Perfect. All
right, the next step. So we did this
done. The next step is actually to add
it to the sheet. So if I go here, I
actually made the sheet. So the
variables that I have, uh, let me just
fill this out so you can see. Go right
here. I have invoice number, client
name, client email, address,
description, total amount, invoice date,
status, and payment method. Now, this is
right here is just a way for us to
actually store the invoice. Uh, cuz
there has to be some place for us to
store all the information. Um, typically
a company, they probably wouldn't have
Google Sheets. They would have maybe a a
notion uh maybe some sort of custom
software they have or but they always
have a database right they always have a
place where they actually have to store
information. So this is what we're going
to use. Let's name this invoice uh
system
and it and YouTube.
And now if I go back here to
uh here I have to add a next step which
is add the invoice to the Google sheet.
So if I go here, I can go to action and
app sheet Google sheets and then I can a
append a row in a sheet which means add
a row connect your account. All you have
to do is create a new credential. You
don't have to do the same thing you did
for Google Drive. You can just sign in
with Google which will take you to a
page like this. Choose your account
continue
and then it's successful and you go back
and name it whatever you want.
Press save. All right. All right. Now
that you connected your Google Sheets,
uh it is going to be a sheet within a
document. You want to append a row
because operation again is the thing
that you're actually doing. And then we
want to look for invoice system and it
and YouTube, which is the first one that
comes up. The sheet will be sheet one
because again this right here is sheet
one.
And now we want to be able to map the
fields. So mapping just means that you
have different columns. You want to add
the variables for each column to make
sure that when we run the automation
they actually show up. Um so it will be
invoice number which is invoice number
client name so customer name client
email so email address
description and in this case it's line
item total amount is this invoice date
it's here status is here payment method
is right here I believe that's it we
have to do anything else no that's all
good Um, okay. So, let's test this. Let
me execute step.
Now, it's running. If I go here, I can
see that the first run did well. Uh, we
have the line items. We have invoice
109, Lucas Martin, the email, address,
description, total amount, invoice date,
status, and payment method. Let me just
freeze this row right here. So, when I
go here, it doesn't it doesn't actually
take it with it. And the next step is
finished. So, this can go green. And you
see how I'm just checking things off as
I actually do this because it is a whole
process. I'm planning it out. And now
the last one is to send an email to the
billing team confirming the invoice. So
the next step is using AI because to
send an email to the billing team, you
typically want to use AI uh depending on
the the email of course. Um but in this
case we want to let AI actually do the
email and we just um set up the email
the Gmail after. So let's add plus
let's do AI. Let's look for an open AI
node which just means hey we're talking
to a GBT like can we do this and it
gives us the output. We are messaging
model.
Uh the again the way to connect to your
openi I showed it before. Uh go to get
the API key and it's the same exact
connection. If you connected it before
you'll have it here. The resource is
text operation is me model because
that's the action that we're doing. The
model will be let's do 4.1 mini. I think
that's [music] more than good. That's
fine. And the prompt is going to be
first a system, right? And then we're
going to have a user prompt. So the
system prompt I'm going to copy from the
other automation and go here will be you
are an email expert for JM media named
Jenny. You receive invoice information.
Your job is to notify the internal
billing team that an invoice was
received or sent. In the evil make sure
that to include the system that has been
added to the fields. So we say okay. So
in the actual email itself we want to
give them a this right here. So anyone
with the link copy the link. want to
give them access to the Google sheet
because I want them to actually have
access to it if they want to look at it.
Uh they get a notification saying, "Hey,
everything's good. By the way, if you
want to look into this further, you can
obviously look at it in the Google
sheet." Your output should be in the
following JSON format. Uh so we tell it
this because when we want to make an
email, the email is composed of two
different things. It's composed of a
subject line and it's composed of a
email body. In this case, because
they're both custom, we want them split
into two different variables. So that's
why we use JSON to then split the email
body and the subject line. And the rules
is don't use any markdown formatting
because Gmail does not lack any
markdown. It doesn't actually recognize
it. And then it actually recognizes HTML
which I'll speak about in just a second
what it is. Uh so we use we tell it that
we say hey talk to talk talk in the way
that Gmail actually likes that you talk
to. Um that's fine. Now the user prompt
is going to be this. User prompt is
going to be the variables. So in this
case, we need to add all the different
variables. So it can be invoice number.
I'm going to cut to me actually
finishing this cuz it's going to take a
while. All right. So we have invoice
number, client name, email, total
amount, and invoice date. Now we can map
this. So invoice number right here,
client name right here. Uh email, total
amount, and invoice date. Yeah, let me
do status as well.
And we can also add payment method at
this point.
Cool. All right. So that is the input
that we give it. So we say hey you would
do XYZ and here's the input that you
have to do this thing for and just give
me the both the emails. Okay. Now one
more thing we have to do here is
actually turning this on. The output
content is JSON because we actually tell
the AI give me JSON. So we wanted to
actually officially say hey the output
should be JSON yes or yes. Um and we
don't want it to error out. So that's
good. Now let's execute the step which
is basically testing. It will use the
previous variables and now it will give
us the email. So the email is all in a
weird format. This is the format that
Gmail likes when you give emails. So
don't worry about this too much but
worry about the fact that you got the
subject line right here and you got the
email body as two different variables
right here that we can then use to
actually send the email. So if I go
here, I'm done with the AI part which is
well I mean I guess it's part of this. I
can go to Gmail
send a message to connect your Gmail to
NN you can go here send sign in with
Google and then you can take go through
the same process that you went through
Google sheets close and there's three
things that we have to fill out the
first one is message uh or resource is a
message operation which is what are we
doing we're sending the message uh who
are we sending the email to in this case
let's do my email the subject line will
be the one here so we just drag it
across and we can see even the output
before we even test which is again
amazing and then and the message itself
or the email type in this case which is
where we add HTML. We have two two
options. So we say okay we're sending
the email to someone. How do we want to
send it to them? Do you want it just
text or do you want to put HTML? HTML is
just a way that you make your emails
look pretty. You know when you guys get
emails that look nice have formatting
that have headers that have all that
stuff. That is because you're using
HTML. So we kind of want to do that
which is why we use HTML and that's what
we tell the AI to output it as HTML. Uh
which is good. So the message in this
case will be the email body which is one
here. We just drag it across. And one
thing more that we have to do is we want
to take this off. So append edit end
attribution which is basically a way for
end to end to market themselves in a
way. Um so when you send an email to
someone if you don't turn this off it
will say this was sent by edit end. So
we turn this off just because it's more
I guess professional more clean. It
looks like it actually came from a real
person even though we all know it's not.
Uh especially when you're doing 100
invoices a day but that's fine. Now we
get it to execute the step. So, we're
testing this. And if I go to my email,
I can see now if I refresh
that I got an email um with all the
details, right? And this is how we
managed to make these look nice and bold
and actually even have a sort of an
embedded link that we can just press
here and it'll take us to the sheet that
we have. All right. So, now let's test
it from scratch with another invoice
from zero.
Let me go to my Google Drive.
Let me
delete this. Not delete this. Actually,
I can just send a new one. In the new
one, let's do a random one here. Let me
see what the name of the person is.
Isabella Moore. And now, if I go here to
edit end, I can run this. Now, what this
will do is it will take the file that
has been created. It will extract the
text. It will then go here to the
information extractor. It will add it to
the Google sheet. It will then think
through AI to make the email that will
be sent to us on Gmail. and we'll have
everything there. If I go here, I can
see that I have Isabella Moore with the
email, with the address, with the
description, with the total amount, with
the invoice date, status, and payment
method. If I go to my email as well, you
can see that now I also have a
notification. Dear billing team, we have
received the invoice uh from Isabella
Moore. And we have all the different
things that we have here, Jenny with no
edits and attribution, with no hey, this
was sent by NLM. And now I also have a
link right here, which takes me again to
the Google sheet with all the
information here.
Hey, so in this video I'm going to build
a human in the loop AI sales agent live
in front of you that takes lead form
submissions. It adds it to your CRM. It
drops a sales email. It roots it to your
team for feedback and automatically
revises it until it's ready to send. So
today I'm going to build the entire
system from scratch in and it end. I'm
going to walk you through my whole
thought process, the whole detours, the
the mistakes I make and everything that
I go through. So you get to see what an
actual development process looks like
when you're building automations. So
this is the automation we're going to
build. It's built on NNN and it all
starts with the lead form uh submission
and this is typically what the the
client or the lead whatever it is they
actually fill out to start the
automation. That's the trigger. Then we
add it to our CRM which is in Google
Sheets. Then we talk to our sales agent
which will draft an email, a sales email
that will be sent to us first. So this
is the human in the doop element. It
will send it to us. We'll revise it,
give feedback. If the feedback is
negative, it will send it to another AI
agent to revise to make the feedback,
make the changes based on what we told
it. send it back and do the whole
repetitive loop until it's positive and
once we approve the email, it will then
send it to the customer. Okay, so let me
show you exactly how it works from the
start until the end. I'm going to
execute the workflow which will run the
automation once go here and now I'm
going to start filling it up. So name
company name will be JM solutions
budget can be 1.5 project description we
are looking to generate leads
for our real estate business
and in time it can be 1 to 3 weeks. When
we press submit here, this will trigger
the automation. So the form is itself,
that's what the customer will do. It
will send it to the first agent to check
against projects that we've done before
to actually incorporate results and
testimonials into the email. It will
then send it to us. So the next step we
have to do is go to our email, go to
this email over here, action required,
new lead budget of 1.15. Um, and this is
what their internal team in the company
is going to look at. They're going to
look at the email. They're going to
respond. So this is a place where you
get to give feedback for the email. So
hey, thanks for reaching out. your time
in one to three weeks. You recently
helped another client. So, see how it
incorporates testimonials here. Then it
says, "Are you available for a 15-minute
call this week?" Okay, let me ask let me
tell it. Don't ask a question at the
end.
Just say or just ask a few times. No,
just ask to provide
a few times
that work for them.
next week,
right? And this is the feedback that I'm
going to give to the agent. I'm going to
press submit. Go back here. You see how
now it roots it to the denied path
because we denied the actual email. We
said, "Hey, make changes is not good."
It will now send it back to us. If we go
here to my email, I will have another
email here, which I can go through. I
can respond. And as we can see,
it changed the email based on the
feedback that we gave it. So, please
share a few times that work for you. So,
I'm going to say, "Okay,
looks good.
and submit it. And now because it's
positive, it will send it to the actual
customer uh or the lead. So I'm going to
go here and now since I'm the lead
itself, I'm going to get an email saying
lead generation results for your real
estate business and I get a whole
customized email for me. Now that's
right there is the automation that we're
going to build step by step. And the
application on this on a business side
is that a lot of customers or a lot of
companies they have a lot of forms on
the websites but the whole process from
when the lead fills out the form to when
they are replied to and so on. It's a
very manual process for companies. What
we're doing here is not only saving that
time for the company to be able to reply
to those emails automatically, but
actually making it custom and also
incorporating our feedback into the
whole process as well, right? And that's
exactly what we're doing. All right,
cool. So, I'm going to start from
scratch and I'm going to go to another
workflow personal and test builds.
Create a workflow. Okay. And we're going
to start here. And before we get to the
actual build and actually putting any
steps into it, I usually like to map out
the automation, what it looks like. It's
sort of like a plan that I have uh
before I get to the actual build. So, it
all starts with the form. So, the first
um the first place is form. And I add a
sticky note saying what kind of things
we want on the form. In this case, it's
name, uh, email,
was it, uh, income, no, budget,
intent,
timeline, and project description
because that's what we want in the
email. Then on the form or after the
form, we ideally want to make sure that
we add it to the CRM. So, add responses
to CRM. And the CRM can be Sheets, it
can be ClickUp, it can be ASA, whatever
you have, uh, or Hopspot. And then you
can then after we add to the ser talk to
the first agent. So first agent to write
sales email. Then ideally we want to
send it back. Send it to us
for feedback and approval.
And now it can go either two ways. If we
approve it, it goes to send the email to
the lead. If we don't approve it using
the feedback that we gave it, it will
then send it back. So I could have two
paths here. I could have what really red
and green right that's approve or deny.
So if we approve it
deny so once it's approved again we will
send it to the a to the customer. So the
lead so in this case will be send email
to lead and if it's denied then we want
to
uh have second agent. So second revision
agent
right here
which will then send it back to us for
feedback, right? And that's exactly what
we want to build. So we start with form.
So there's a form that lead fills out
with different variables right here or
questions. Then we add the responses to
our CRM. In this case, it's Google
Sheets. Then we add the first or we talk
to the first agent to write the sales
email. Then we send it to us for
feedback and approval. And I forgot to
add one more step here which is uh in
this case it's a intent agent. Okay,
I'll explain exactly what that is
because we get feedback but how does the
system know whether it's positive
feedback, whether it's negative
feedback, how does it know whether it's
accepted or denied? Right? Uh so this is
intent. So feedback intent agent
feedback intent agent.
Okay. And now if it's approved,
it goes there. send the email to the
lead and if it's not approved, then we
talk to our second agent which will
write the email. Make this smaller. So,
quick note here. Um, you don't actually
build automations and go straight to the
platform and start building them. You
always want to have a process to
actually map things out. Map out what
you want to build first and then go on
and build it. It's sort of like you're
building a castle on a foundation of
sand. So, you always want to make sure
you have that road map and that guide
that you can then take when you're
building automations. All right, so
let's go to an end and actually build
it. Um the first step of course because
we have the form we have to create a
form. Now thankfully we have NN which
has an internal way of creating the
forms. What I mean by this is that they
have just an internal NN end form right
here. Um so we can use this we go here
and form and we can use the trigger. So
the trigger just means what's the first
thing that starts the automation and in
this case will be on a new and end form
event. So if I press this button it'll
take me to this page uh where I have a
few things to look at. The first thing
is test URL versus production URL. And
test URL just means that this URL will
be used when we are filling out the form
on test mode. So when we activate the
automation right here,
then only do we use the production URL.
Okay. So test URL is what we're using
right now to test it. But production is
when you're activated. Authentication is
when you want to add a password. So you
want to add a password to this form. So
let's say I add a basic O uh name
credential. I can create a credential. I
can name it YouTube human in the loop
agent. I'm definitely not going to
remember what this is. Uh user will be
user and then it'll be 1 2 3 4 5. So let
me show you exactly what this is. Um
close. It's fine. Uh no thanks. And now
I can do new lead
submission.
I want to show you exactly what the
basic off is. I can execute the step and
see before we actually get to the form
it asks us for a password. Well, why do
we do this? It's sort of like you're
putting a password on your phone. You
don't want everyone to have access to
it. Uh you want only the people who have
the password to have access to it. So in
this case, if I put the password that I
put before, 1 2 3 4 5 and sign in. Then
I can obviously do the form and whatever
I have right on there and I can submit.
In this case, there's no questions. Uh
but that's what I do and I get the
output. Uh so that's what basic off is.
um form title. So let's let me actually
turn this off because I don't want the
the password. So this will just be free.
Uh the title will be this. So this will
be we can add this as we'll get back to
you as soon as possible.
Now that we have the description and the
title, we want to add the elements. So
in this case, we spoke about having
name, email, budget, intent, timeline,
and per project description. So to add
questions, we have to add a form
element. So in this case, it can be full
name. It will be text placeholder will
be James Low. So this is the thing that
you see before you actually fill it out
to give you an idea of what you have to
fill out there. Required yes will be
required. Then we have let's say email.
So this will be email and email could be
james.logmail.com.
That's what we have here. And we can
also make this required. So the the user
has to fill it out. Then we have another
uh question here which can be company
name. In this case, we didn't add it
here, but it can be a question. So, let
me do it here. Company
JM solutions, which is the company name
that I have. And then we have budget.
So, budget can be a not a text uh but it
can be
a drop down. So, dropown just means you
have different options. So option one
will be less I can just do this less
than 1,000 add a field option. Option
two will be 1,00
to 3,000
like this and then 3,000
to 5,000
and another fill option 5,000
plus. So in this case more than 5,000
that's for budget and then we have um
project description. So in this case
wouldn't be this be acquired project
description which should be a text
field.
So you can just add we want a system
that
boom you can go up to the user required
field and then we have timeline. So
timeline again can be a drop down uh
because you want to give them a few
options.
It can be
within one week, one to three weeks and
then we can do three weeks above. So one
week to 3 weeks
and then we can do 3 weeks plus. All
right, cool. So uh the last thing we
have to fill out is respond when. So
this is saying when do we want to send
the data? In this case, we want to send
the data when the form is submitted. But
there are cases where you want to send
the data when the workflow finishes. So
you start the form and does it only
submit does it only send a confirmation
of submission when the the actual
workflow finishes when the automation
finishes? In this case we don't need
this. Uh we just have form submitted. So
whenever the user submits the form it
starts the automation and we can now
test it. So in this case as I mentioned
we're testing it. So we're using the URL
here. I can execute the step. I can now
just fill out the form. So for
company name
budget it can be 3,000 project
description we want more leads more
leads and 1 to three weeks right if I go
back here I can see that this is the
output that I get so [music] we trigger
the form using the NNN and now we get
this output so full name email company
name and so on now we can use this
variables so these are called dynamic
variables because They are dynamic. They
change every single time. Um, and then
we can use them for for next steps. So,
hormone is good. Took us a minute to put
this together, but now we can add this
to the CRM. So, the CRM will be a Google
sheet. So, let me add the Google sheet
here. We can do CRM intake YouTube
in the loop
agent.
I have so many Google Sheets of these.
So, I make I have to make sure that I
know exactly which Google sheet is what.
Um, so this can be full name. Uh I think
we had company or email.
Let me just quickly check.
Have company name, full name, email,
company name, budget, project
description, and timeline.
Uh
God, how did I forget to read?
Budget, project description, and timer.
project description.
Now we have timeline
and make this bold. Let me make this
here white. Like to make this pretty.
Okay, cool. Uh, now that we made the CRM
and typically we use Google Sheets
because that's the easiest, but um, a
company probably wouldn't have Google
Sheets. They would have a HubSpot. they
would have a notion or they would have a
clickup where they store all the leads
that come through. Um, but this is just
for testing purposes. All right. So once
we made the CRM, we can now connect it.
So to connect the form to the uh Google
Sheets, we just have to press plus. Look
for Google Sheets right here. And now we
want to append a row. Append just means
add, right? So we want to append a row
in a sheet. Uh connect your account. So
you can connect your account by creating
a new credential. In this case, you can
sign in with Google. I'll do it step by
step. my email.
Continue
connection successful. So if I go back,
I can see that the account was
connected. I usually would recommend
naming it um the email. So
five and then the date which is 28th of
August.
Okay, cool. And you press save. [music]
So now the connection is done. Uh the
resources sheet within document append
row because that's the action that we're
doing. There's a bunch of stuff that we
can do and we're going to use I believe
it's get rose. Yeah, we're going to use
get rose later on. Now, it's asking for
the document. The document in this case
is the CRM intake YouTube human in the
loop. That's a long name. Okay, they're
there. I know it's that one cuz we named
it. So, that's good. And sheet one will
be the sheet that we have to map. Again,
sheet one is here. And now it's asking
us to put the values to send. So, in
this case, we're mapping each column
manually because we are manually adding
variables for each column. And we're
saying, hey, full name needs to go in
column one, which is full name. Second
column is email, company name, budget,
restriction, and timeline. We do
everything for for the different
columns. So, full name, let me drag it
across right here. Email, drag it across
here. Company name here. Budget here.
Project description here. Timeline. I
forgot to add one more, which is date
submitted.
All
right, cool. Um, I want the date
submitted because I know I want to know
exactly when they submitted the date or
when they submitted the form. Uh,
because that's always good to know. I
can just refresh here. And now it gives
me the the column that I put. And now
this is the variable. So submitted at
which tells me the date. This gives me
also the time and all that sort of
stuff. So we're going to drag this
across. Submitted at. And now I wouldn't
want this like this. So I'm going to
format this in a way where it's actually
readable for the company and they can
actually understand. I mean cuz who's
going to understand this? You're going
to have to spend time even thinking
about what this means. So, uh, to do it,
I believe it's format date.
Uh, no, it's not that. Okay. So, let's
see why it doesn't work. Uh, let me see
what I have. Suggested to date time.
Okay. Okay. Okay. And then we have to
format it right right here. Yeah.
Format. And now it's asking me to format
it in the right way. In this case, you
see the result. The way that this is set
up, we just added the formula. www mm dd
will result in this uh in this case I
probably wouldn't want it like that um
let me just go to the formatting guide
which will show me exactly the kind of
formula that I need to add this looks
crazy with the with the color that I
have um
in this case we want we can do this uh
August 6 so let me do FF
so if I do FF here it should yeah 28th
of August 2025 at 620 20. That's
perfect. Uh now if I execute the step
which will use the previous variables to
actually add it to the sheet. If I go
here I can see that the responses were
added here. Okay. So gem solution this
this and then we also have the date.
Space this out and then that's good. All
right cool. So now that we have this we
can go to our next step which is
actually making the sales email. So in
order for us to make the sales email we
have to use a agent. Okay. There's a few
reasons why. Um, we typically would have
like this is a agent workflow because
we're we're also formatting the email
and I'll explain exactly what it means.
But if you go to AI, you can either use
an agent or you can just simply use an
LLM. I typically use an agent because
we're doing different actions with the
with the thing. Like we're not just
telling the agent write the email, but
we're also telling it, hey, formatted.
And AI agents are usually very good at
taking something and then doing
something with it. Um, as in doing
different actions. So, I'm going to
press AI agent to connect this step to
here. And now I'm going to rename this
sales. So first sales agent, sales email
agent
rename. And now I have to connect this
to three different things. Uh and I have
to put a prompt inside which is the main
thing. Um so here chat model will be
openi
to connect your openai here create a new
credential. You have to go to platform
theopenai.com
sign up. to log in. I want to show you
everything cuz I feel like this is one
of the things that uh it's like the
small things that actually matter when
you build automations. Dashboard, go to
API keys, create an API key, name it
whatever you want, right? Then you'll
have So, let's actually do it. Human in
the loop agent YouTube. Create a secret
key. Don't don't worry about any of
this. This is the API key. So, save this
because you're not going to be able to
reaccess it unless you make a new one.
Um, so we go back to NN API key. You
paste it here. Then you save it and then
it will automatically be connected.
Okay. Close. All right. Cool. Then you
want to connect it to 4.1 mini. That's
fine. And actually we have to go inside
the agent first before we do the other
ones. So let me go inside. And now we
have to do a few things. Uh the first
thing is source for prompt. So this is
asking us what is that thing that's
going into the AI agent every single
time. Uh in this case it would be the
the details of the lead, right? Which
will be the details of the form. Um
which is why we have to change this. So
this right here it says connect to chat
trigger node. This means that usually
when you have an AI agent you chat to it
and then it does something. Uh which is
why we're using chat trigger node. But
in this case we're using a form. So we
have to change this to define below. And
now here we have to add the things that
are going into the agent every single
time. Uh so I can go here to expression
go full screen and now I can add the
lead details to the form. So in this
case it can be here's lead
here's the yeah here's the new lead
intake information
then we can start adding it. A full name
right here. Yeah. Drag it across. Email,
company name,
budget,
project, description,
timeline,
and then I also want to add something
else later on. Uh but email goes here,
company name goes here, budget goes
here, product description goes here,
goes here. All right. So, uh the reason
why and now this is basically changing
every single time. So these variables
will change as the form submissions
change. Uh which is what we want because
we want the sales email to be different
every single time for every lead. Um but
the reason we're putting it in the user
message is because in the user message
we add the things that change. the
system message which is what we find
here system message. This is what we
tell the AI agent what it needs to do
right in general and the identity that
it has. So if I go here I can now start
adding the system message. I'm going to
go here. There's a prompt that we're
going to give the agent for it to think
through what it needs to do and what it
is. I'm going to copy the prompt from
the other agent that I built before and
paste it here. Uh and by the way you can
either take a screenshot and put it
through chat GBT and tell hey can you
transcribe this or I'm going to show you
after at the end how you can get the
whole resource for free the whole
blueprint. So don't worry. Um but this
basically is saying you are an expert
salesperson for an agency that delivers
a solutions. Your job is to respond to
incoming leads by addressing their needs
in a professional manner. You'll receive
an information that looks like a lead
project encryption and timeline and your
goal is to convince them and let them uh
let them know that we are the best AI
agency on the market. The project uh so
the tools right so this is the typical
structure that we have. We have overview
we have the tools that are connected to
the agent and we have the rules. Now,
I'm going to explain to this I'm going
to explain to you what it is. Something
we forgot to add to the mirror right
here when the first agent actually um is
doing because we want the agent to be
connected to the Google sheet
with project results because we want to
incorporate results to our email. So, we
don't want to say, "Hey, thanks for
filling out the form. We can definitely
help." We want to say, "Hey, I saw that
you did a lead generation. I saw that
you're looking for a lead generation
project. We actually did a lead
generation project for John a few months
ago and we got this results. We can help
you, right? So, it's always good to
incorporate proof into what you're
doing. Um, so we want to connect this to
Google Sheets. We want to connect this
as well to let's leave it to Google
sheet, right? So, in this case, uh,
that's why we see the projects. So this
is the tool that's Google Sheets in this
case where it gets the different rows
from our Google Sheets to then give to
the AI agent uh for it to to actually
use to make the email. We say use this
tool to search to the previous project
we've done that can be included in okay
cool. So before so to actually make the
tool we have to make the sheet because
right here is the intake but then right
here is the projects.
So what we want here is a way for the
agent to pull projects in or pull
results that we've done before. So what
I'm going to do is I'm going to copy the
um the results that I had before. And
bear in mind this is something that the
company can start adding every single
time after after a minute. It the agent
will always be automatically uh updating
as in it will take all the roles that
are here. So if you keep adding that's
fine. It will keep on on taking
whatever's here. Um and again these are
the projects that are going to be
included when the agent needs to refer
to let's say someone said lead genen it
will use this example for result in
legen project. Same thing with general
tech on boarding content and whatever it
is. So actually now that I start to
think about it, we forgot to add the
intent. Um
okay,
which is drop down
lead generation.
Then we have content creation.
And this is something that happens,
right? You just think through, you just
forget. Um that's why I want to show you
the raw version of me building
automations because that's what actually
drives value to people. Uh on boarding
automation uh let's do general
uh general automation support.
All right. So um yeah this is need
definitely needed when we have to give
to the agent for it to pull information
from the Google sheet. Um so let's rerun
this. Let me actually update this. Let
me go here. Let me do
tent
actually. Let me
So we have to shift this and then put
here. Let me run this first.
Let me just fast forward to me filling
it up.
All right. So I submitted the form. Now
we have this data to to work with. We
can pin it, right? Pinning it just means
that we don't have to rerun the form
every single time to execute the next um
nodes. The automation we can use this as
test data for previous for the next
steps. And now we want to add this to I
refresh this.
Okay. This is good. Uh intent will be
going here. Okay, cool. So now we also
want to give it the intent. So let me go
here. Let me say intent
submission. We can put the intent here.
All right, cool. Now we want to go here.
And now because we are able to give the
intent to the the agent. Now I can use
the projects, right? Because the intent
is what's linked to here to the
projects. Perfect. Um okay. So let's go
here.
We also give it some rules. So keep the
email concise and professional under 100
words. This comes from reactive
prompting rather than active prompting
which just means that we prompt as we
get errors. We prompt as we iterate as
feedback as we get feedback and feedback
only comes from actually using the
automation actually running it. Um we
give it a few objectives. Retrieve
information about the project with the
lead to prove that the team is capable.
Okay. So this is this is the part where
we tell it to use previous projects
results to give in the email. Always
write the email in HTML. Um because
Gmail to make it look pretty. So to make
it look like this with new lines, this
is called new line. One and two spaces
between lines, we use something called
HTML tags. So break. So this right here,
BR really stands for break, right? And
that's why we add one, that will just do
a new line. If we add two, that will be
two new lines. One, two. Okay, so this
is very important. Um, and then don't
add any emojis in email. Yeah, don't
lie. Definitely don't add emojis because
in the sales emails, emojis are the
worst thing you can add. Um, perfect. Uh
we're going to use this later on but
don't worry about it now. Uh now we can
connect this to the Google Sheets. So go
Google sheets sheets tool connection. We
did all this we already did. The
resource will be um yeah the resource
will be sheet within document and we can
get rows. So we want to get the rows
when I get these and we're going to let
the AI actually think through which
result which project it needs to use to
then make the sales email. So the
document will be CRM YouTube human in
the loop agent. The sheet will be
projects
and I'm going to leave this empty. So
execute step.
And now see how it got the three
different uh four different rows. Den
responses onboarding or content
onboarding and general tech. Right? And
now that's what's going to use to
actually make the email to incorporate
the results into the email. All right.
Cool. So now that we did this, we can
now um I want to show you exactly why we
have to add something else to the agent
because it's a bit more technical. Um
but it's actually very very easy to
understand once you see why we need it
in the first place. So I'm going to run
this.
I'm going to show you exactly what we
need this for this agent right here.
What it did is that it just wrote the
email. Okay. So dear Mikuel, we
specialize in custom driven lead
generation systems and understanding.
Okay. The only problem with this is that
we don't get the subject line and we
don't get the body of the email in two
different yeah in two different uh
variables. So if I paste this all into
Gmail, there will be no subject line. So
for us to be able to make an email that
has a subject line and an email body, we
need it to be in a very specific format,
right? That's why we press we toggle
this on which is require specific output
format because you want the subject line
and the email to be in two different
variables. So once this is turned on, we
have a new option here which is output
parser. We can just press this
structured output parser and don't worry
um I'm going to copy what I had before
but when you get the blueprint you can u
you can directly have it but what I'm
basically saying is let me just copy
this
that I want the first property. So the
first variable here is subject line
which is the subject line of the email
and then the email body which is the
body of the email and then the required
is subject line and the email body. So
we want the actual output format to be
in a subject line and the body of the
email. So let me show you the difference
now when I run this.
Okay, let's see why there's an error.
All right, so after some error handling
uh I realized that the code here was
wrong. I actually just pasted the right
one. Um so in this case again it was
just a few tweaks. subject is subject
line and then we have email body
required. Again, if you have the the
whole setup, you can just have it here.
I don't worry, but you want to make sure
that this is right. And by the way, if
you ask me, how did I get this code? You
can simply go to chat GBT and you can
say, hey, I'm feeding the AI or feeding
the code parser and email with a subject
line and the body together. I want to
output it as two different variables.
One is subject, one is email body. And
it will give you this code right here.
So, you can see here we have a subject
line and we have an email body. Okay. So
now we can go to the next step. The next
step is actually setting this. So
setting the edit fields set. Why do we
do this is because ideally when we go to
the next step which is human in the loop
agent which is what you're here for is
we get the feedback and then we get the
intent of the feedback. If it's positive
we send it to the customer. If it's
negative then we reroot it back. But the
only problem is is that we want to routt
the same variable back to the agent or
back to the human in the loop agent. So
it's better if I show you rather than
tell you uh because it makes much more
sense. But in this case let's just set
two variables which is subject
I'm going to press here which in this
case is JSON output subject and email
body right which is email
body. Okay so these are the two
different variables. Uh and now when we
route it back to the agent that actually
has to do the revision we loop it back
here. Okay, we're looping back here for
it to use this variables to um to reroot
it back. Okay, so now that we have the
variables set, we can then go to the
human in the loop element. So human in
the loop will be
um human in the loop right here. And you
can see we don't have only email, we
have Google chat, we have outlook, we
have different software. In this case,
we are using Gmail. So we can go here to
connect your Gmail to NN. We have to go
here, sign in with Google. It'll take
you through the same thing that we went
through before. Message, send, and
waiting for response. That's that's the
thing that is human in the loop. The
email is who are we sending the email to
for it to give us feedback. In this
case, we can put my email. If I go here
uh on the email, I think we added action
required new lead with budget. Okay, so
we put the budget here and then here we
put hey we have a new lead created.
Okay, project description and then email
drafted. Okay, cool. So here subject
line will be this new lead with budget
of and this variable will be changed
because that's the thing that changes
every single time. Add fields.
No, it's actually form submissions. I
can go to budget right here. So, it will
change and then the message like I
mentioned before is, "Hey, Mikuel,
we have a nude lead form submission.
Please revise the email and give
feedback
on the copy." So, in this case, we can
just add two. So, this just it's just
two headings. heading to we can do
project description so the internal team
knows has a context to what we're giving
feedback on project will be here and now
we can add the email so subject I would
add a subject line
subject actually I do email
uh
I think this would work with markdown
this is markdown format um subject line
will be used
which is this.
Then we have email body
is this. Let's test this. Uh let's see
if it works, how it works, uh when it
works, why it works. So waiting for
input. Um okay, cool. So now we go here.
Can see. Okay, so this didn't work. We
we have to take this off. Um but I can
go here. I can see that we got the
email. So that's all good. Okay,
perfect. Um, okay. I also realized just
now that
so let me just give you feedback like I
can approve.
Perfect. Um
I realized that this
so email doesn't as I mentioned before
email needs HTML not um it needs HTML
not markdown format. This is markdown in
order to put HTML. So in order to put
heading two on HTML we have to use this
uh here and then to close it we have to
use this slash forward slash
and then same thing with this
and we can just remove this I don't
think we need it no body
yeah that's fine okay um okay put and
then we can add please provide feedback
on the email if you have actually no
preview if you have
perfect now as you can see when I went
to the email it actually just asked me
to approve but in this case we want to
leave space for feedback so in this case
we want to add free text so what this
means is that when he sends us the email
to revise we don't just press approve we
can also press approve and deny right
but we want to add uh text we want to
add feedback so we can say hey change
this change that and then it will then
send it to the agent to revise it and
then change it, right? Um because free
text is what we need. I want to take off
appendn attribution which is just this
automated ven saying hey n I did this.
Um so we can do this. We can execute the
step again. And now if I get the email I
can see that it says respond and the
response now I can give feedback. Okay.
I can say, "Hey, uh, this needs to be
more concise
and professional."
Submit. And now that's the feedback
that's going to come through. Say, "Hey,
this needs to be concise and
professional." So, ideally, we want to
then talk to the other agent, give it
the email that we dropped right now,
give it the feedback, and then let it
revise and then do the whole thing again
and make it a repetitive loop. Okay. So,
now that we have the feedback, as I
mentioned on the Miro before, we want to
send it to the feedback intent agent.
So, so first let's rename this to human
in the loop
rename. Uh, and then now I can send it
to the text classifier cuz the text
classifier on NN basically takes text
and classifies basically says hey based
on the text this is what it is based on
the options that we give it the
categories right. Um, okay. So text
classify would be the this right here
will be the text to classify which would
be the the feedback that we give it and
then it'll be two categories. One is
approved and one is denied. Right? So
approve
and then let me just copy the
description from the agent that I built
before.
We go here. I say the sales agent
approved the email accepted the way it
was written. The text that we're
classifying intense that it was accepted
and that everything was uh good. example
output. Yes, that's fine. Looks good.
Send it through. Now, this came from
actually testing because how does it the
text specifier isn't always 100%
correct, right? Sometimes we give it
something we say, "Hey, can you change
this part?" But it assumes that we
accepted it. So, it sends it to the
lead. Uh we want to make sure that we
give it examples of what someone might
say as a way for them to reference
whether it's accepted or denied. Um so,
that's why we add the examples. And then
category will be denied which will be
the uh right here expression. Let me go
here. Here the sales agent denied the
email and denied the way it was written.
Uh the text that we're classifying
intends that it needs updating or
changing. Usually usually um we predate
feedback on how to do so. And then we
give it a few examples. So make it
shorter. I don't like it. It's too long.
Include other projects and no. So these
are various things that you would um ask
the agent or you would tell the agent
and then we've tell it hey based on
these sort of examples this is the
denied path. Now [snorts] okay this is
good. Um so now as you can see we now
have two different paths. So now we can
go to the side where we send the email
to the lead and then the denied path
where we have to make the agent to
revise. Uh but before we do that we have
to add a model because this thing's
through an AI. So the model here will be
uh open AI chat model. Again we already
connected it. So 4.1 is fine. And now
that we categorized the different types
of responses based on what's approved
and what's denied, we can now send it
two different ways. So let's do the easy
one first which is approved. In this
case, we just um use a Gmail node to
send it to the customer. So create send
a message. Yeah, send a message. Um you
already connected a message send to in
this case we have to execute previous
nodes.
Uh okay, let me just add test email.
subject line will be hello. Let me just
change this real quick later.
Uh let me just run this.
Okay, pin this.
And then now I believe that we have
okay, we don't have data here. So let me
just run this again
and go here to my email.
Make this shorter. Now this right here I
can pin.
And now I can use this. Okay. So I can
use this to say for it to classify
whether it's denied or approved. So as
you can see it went down the denied path
because we said make it short. We give
it feedback. Um okay. So now right here
I can then pull information from the
form which will be email which will be
subject line will be in this one right
here. Subject line. actually need to
remove hello first
and then the body of the email which in
this case again it's HTML. We can also
put text but we're using HTML um for
this for the actual message. Okay. So
now if I test this. Okay. I actually
didn't get it for some reason. I didn't
get any email. Let me try again to see
if it works this time.
Okay. I think it's because it didn't go
down this path but or it's because these
are pinned. Let me just unpin this. do
each one individually. By the way, I'm
just pressing P when I hover over this.
I can try rerun this.
Okay, let's just go through the whole
phase. Um, right here and go here. I can
get an email and say yes.
Looks good. Submit. Go back. And now
because it's approved, it will go down
this path. Okay, cool. That's why uh
because the text that we give it before
was the denied path. So, we go here. Um
and then say boost your lead generation
one week. We're specialized in
developing lead generation tailored
systems for business. For instance, we
recently helped a real estate firm
generate 20 leads. Do you see how it
pulls in these sort of projects? We
recently helped a firm generate 20 leads
in 5 days after working with us which
generated 100k pipeline. That's what it
uses to uh in the email, right? To
generate sort of authority and trust. Uh
given your timeline and budget, we're
confident we can deliver. Okay, best
regards. And now this right here I don't
want. Okay, so this is where we go here
to the email node and add options. We
can then uh append we can turn this off.
Okay, append and end attribution. Turn
this off so that we don't need um we
don't have the sponsorship which is
right here.
Okay, so name this to send so lead email
and that's the first path for approved.
So the next step is the denied path. So
in this case we get the feedback and we
give it to another agent to revise it.
Okay, so I'm going to press add AI
agent. In this case, we can name it
revision agent. We don't need to connect
it to a chat node. I mean, we don't have
it connected. So, we just have to define
it below. And the thing that we give it
is, let me go expression is the feedback
and the email, right? So, it knows that
both of them. So, in this case, it will
be feedback
received,
which will be this one here.
and the email body which will be this
one here
right and sub.
So we give it okay uh and now we want to
give it a system message because we want
to give it an identity in the whole
thing that we give it before the only
thing that changes now is the fact that
now it needs to revise but it still
sends it still does the actual email.
I'm just going to copy and paste the
prompt that I wrote before uh so we
don't have to waste time actually
writing it. [snorts] And I have you are
helpful intelligent email assistant who
needs to update a sales email based on
the provided feedback. I'm going to add
overview which I forgot to add. The
tools is the same. The rules are the
same and final notes are the same. Um
okay, cool. And uh we still have to turn
this on because we still need it to be
in a very specific format. In this case,
it's subject line and email. Again, the
only thing that changes is that this
makes a revision, but the output is
still the same, which is an email. So
I'm going to put this require specific
format. And now I have to connect these
to a chat model to a tool and help you
parse it. The good thing about N&N is
that you don't have to connect it again
uh to this to to a different thing. We
can use the previous chat model the
previous tool and the previous operate
parser. Okay, so they're connected to
the same thing. So this goes here, it
uses these, then goes here if it needs
to go here and it uses it again. So you
don't have to redo it. And I can press
save. And now let's test it. So let me
go here.
Let me use the feedback that we got from
here. Let me go here.
Hey, Mikuel, we specialize in customized
lead generation systems. We recently
helped. I told it to be more concise. I
think that's what Yeah, more concise and
professional. Do a quality so we can
see. Yeah, I think this more concise.
Definitely more concise. I don't know
about professional. Um, but that's fine.
And now to make sure that we can send it
back to the human in the loop to make
sure that it's a whole repetitive
process, we have to pin this across and
put it in the edit fields. Okay, so this
is where it all links together because
we want it to be a repetitive loop. So
we want to make the email for the first
agent which only writes the first email,
then send it to the human in the loop to
make sure that we revise. If it's bad,
it will revise it. Send it back again.
If it's bad again, it will revise it
until we accept it. Okay? So it's a
whole repetitive process. So there's no
human, the only human in the loop is us
actually approving it or denying it. Uh
but the automation is smart enough so
that we can loop it back. And the reason
why we're using this node right here
which I explained before is because the
output here subject and email body is
the same type of variables that we get
here subject email body. Okay. So this
basically gets the input from here and
from here and they're all the same. The
only thing that changes is the actual
content right but the variable name the
key this is called the key is the same.
So that's how we use that. Um okay so
let me unpin this and we can run this
from the start until the end. Save.
Unpin this as well.
Save. And now I can execute workflow.
It's going to be here. And I can start
filling out the form. James Michael.
Now obviously this should be above um we
can change it later in in the form. But
that's the whole formula there. Submit.
And now this starts the automation.
Okay. So it sends it to our CRM. So if
you go here to uh that was the old one
to here she won James Michael Corp
budget authority uh budget description
timeline intent and date submitted it
will now send it to us for revision
action required let's say we look at
this and we say
respond we say [snorts] you need to
ask them at the
to give you a few times that work for
them
next week for a call. Okay, so in this
case, it should send it to the denied
because we gave a feedback. So see how
it goes here. It will use the AI
and we use this tools as well. Send it
back another email. So could you please
provide a few times that work for you
next week? Let me say
make this a bit longer. So now when I
submit it, it then goes back to the same
thing. You see how it's a whole
repetitive loop? It goes through every
single time. Um, and that's why it's
it's a great system to have because it
doesn't really end until you accept it.
I go here again. I can
respond and say yes. All good.
Press submit. And now because it's
approved, it then goes here. Okay. And
we get the email which is this. So let's
discuss your AI driven automation. It
made it a bit longer like we asked it
to. It also made the question here. Um,
and it added the case study right here.
Okay. So, that right there is I mean one
step ahead that we can do is actually
make only the first name, not the full
name. So, let's just do that right now.
Let me go here. Um,
yeah, let me actually just put first
name. I think that would work in some
Yeah, I could do first name.
And I think this needs to be split.
I think it needs to be a space.
Yeah. And then I can first get the
first. Yeah. So this gets James. So a
full name is like this, right?
And this is always good to know because
when you're building automations, you
want to have these sort of formulas uh
at hand. So full name is first name
space last name. So we're saying is
split this by the space. So it will be
one and two and I want the first that
comes here. So split by the space space
here and then I want the first. If I
said last it will get the last name. So
let me say last it will get Michael
right? James Michael. I mean in this
case it would because the full name is
James Michael it will get Michael. And
if you're enjoying this Enit course,
then you might want to check out our AI
automation circle, which is a school
community for people who looking to
learn AI automations from zero, either
to apply in their own business or to
start the AI agency to provide services
to clients. We have people introducing
themselves every single day, asking
questions, sharing wins, getting
technical support, and also looking for
jobs and partnerships. We also have a
classroom full of courses, which is the
AI automations 101 course, an extension
to this course. the templates vault,
which is all the resources from our
YouTube channel in case you want to work
with us oneonone to start and scale your
agency. We have all the weekly
recordings from every single call that
we do, plus over $20,000 in discount
codes. We also have two calls a week for
weekly huddles to answer any questions
and also VIP coding sessions. We
actually build systems from scratch. The
only catch is not everyone gets in, so
feel free to apply and make sure you put
some thoughts into your answers. With
that being said, let's get back to the
course.
I built an AI agent on Nitn that reads
my contacts, manages my emails and my
calendar, and even writes my blog post.
And honestly, it still blows my mind.
So, in today's video, I'm going to show
you exactly how I did it. All right, so
let me show you exactly how it works. We
have the agent pulled up here. And then
we also have Telegram, which is exactly
how I get to talk to the agent. Let me
just say, can you send an email to James
Low, uh, telling him that we have dinner
tomorrow at 7 p.m. in Rome, and also,
can you put that on the calendar to make
sure that we have it there for 7:00 p.m.
and send an invite to him and, uh, yeah,
let me know when it's done. So, right
now, the agent had a task assigned to
him. It's going out and finding the
different agents that I need to talk to
in order to fulfill the task. It's using
both the email agent and the calendar
agent. As you can see, the email is
done. The calendar is done. And I get a
text saying that the email to James Low
about dinner tomorrow at 7 p.m. in Rome
has been sent. And the calendar event
for dinner has also been created. So if
I go to my email right here, I should
expect an email saying we have dinner
tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. in Rome, which is
fine. Calendar, I can see that we have
dinner in Rome, which is scheduled for
7:00 to 8:00 p.m. And I never told it to
do 1 hour, but it was smart enough to
understand that for dinner, uh, 1 hour
was fine, which is great. And then it
sent an invitation to $100 million
peanuts, which is the email that I have
unlisted under James Low right here. The
real ones know what this is and it was
scheduled automatically for me and the
email was sent. All right, cool. So now
you got to see what the AI agent does.
Let's go to mirror right here. So I drew
up this diagram which shows exactly the
fundamentals or the way that this
multi-step AI agent works. Now we still
have an input and we have an output.
Sorry for that. Uh the input is
essentially what I told it. So hey, can
you do XYZ for me? Can you schedule an
email? Hey, you schedule um can you put
something on the calendar? Right, this
is an instruction that we tell the AI
agent to start with. That's the input.
Uh and the output is hey yeah everything
was good. So after we give it the input
that goes onto the multi-step AI agent.
Now think of this as a CEO of the
company. CEO of the AI agents. It has
system prompts and instructions. So what
these are are instructions that say hey
you are a helpful intelligent assistant,
right? The typical prompt that you put
on for an AI agent. And we also say here
are the tools that you have access to.
Here are the agents that you have access
to. If this happens, if you asked to
send an email, then choose this agent.
If you're asked to do the calendar, then
choose that agent. Right? So,
fundamentally, this multi-step AI agent
thinks with its brain, which is the LLM,
and also has a memory, which means it
remembers the previous conversations
that you had or the previous questions
that you asked. And on a high level, the
multi-step AI agent gets an input, which
means it gets a a request, right? And
then chooses which agent to talk to. So,
think of these as head of departments.
So the CEO has different head of
departments in their company. So it gets
a request and it chooses hey based on
what I was told let's say we do a
schedule calendar event for tomorrow for
dinner which is exactly what I did. Then
it would go out and talk to the head of
calendar so calendar agent. It sends a
request saying, "Hey, I got a request
saying that we want to schedule a dinner
for tomorrow 7 p.m." And then that
calendar agent talks tools which are the
employees which actually do the thing
which actually schedule the event create
the event through a request and then
they get a response which is yeah it was
successful and the response back to here
saying hey everything was good and
obviously these head of departments
think with the brain which is the LLM in
this case but let's say we asked it to
send a calendar event or even send an
email in this case because we have a
contact department we because we have a
contact agent the first it has to that
we instructed to is hey if we're told or
if you're told to schedule a calendar
event or schedule an email the first
step you have to do is actually find the
contact of the person that we're talking
about because I'm just saying the name
and then you can do the other things so
for the example that I gave you for the
calendar you have the input which is
calendar multi-step AI agent first step
is contact agent so to get the contacts
that it needs through a request in a
response right talking the tools as well
which is the employees which gives the
contacts and find the contacts then it
goes here then it says Okay, what do I
have to do first? In this case, calendar
agent. So, we schedule the calendar. So,
head of department goes to the employee
saying, "Hey guys, can you do it?" Yes,
it's done. [music] Sends a response.
Everything was good. And then talks to
the email agent, which is head of email
in this case for the company. Then from
the email agent, it assigns it to his
employees, which are tools, through a
request. So, it sends a request like,
"Hey guys, can you do this?" Then sends
a response, which is, "Yeah, everything
was good." And then once everything is
executed based on what we told it to do,
it then gives me the output saying,
"Hey, everything was good." And so on.
And we also have a blog agent which in
this case wasn't used but this agent is
just used when we tell it to write a
blog right and then it goes out to the
head of content per se and then head of
content assigns it to his employees
which are tools through a request and
then we get a response right and that's
a whole repetitive loop that happens
every single time but this is
non-deterministic so what does
nondeterministic mean it means that the
input can result in different outputs so
I can say hey send an email and it will
send an email but I can also say send a
blog and it will send a blog so it the
one input could result in mult multiple
different outputs. That's what
nondeterministic means. It's not
determined, right? Uh so that's what it
is. So the first step to this AI agent
is the trigger. So the trigger is the
first thing that actually starts the
automation, starts the the AI agent
because there's a way that there's a
systematic way that we actually talk to
the AI agent. It's like you're talking
to an employee. There has to be an
input, right? And this is the input
right here. Uh, so if I go on here,
which you can find by the way when you
go to Telegram,
go here, and then you go down to
triggers, which is essentially, I don't
know if you guys can see it, but
all message right here. So, this is the
one we're going to use
to then trigger. So, it says, hey,
whenever a message comes, so trigger on
message. Whenever a message comes, can
you please just um allow it to or can
you please just trigger the automation?
Can you start the automation? And to
connect to your telegram, all you have
to do is press here on credential to
connect with. This is my account. You
can create new credentials. And then to
actually connect this, so let me press
this here, which talks to the agent from
N&N, which gives you like a step-by-step
instructions. Uh there's a process to
it. You have to talk to an agent called
the botfather, which is Yeah. So create
a Telegram account, start a chat with
the botfather. So you have to use this
link right here. And then you can uh you
have to give it a slash something. You
have to start a conversation with Yeah.
/neubot. And then you can get your API
key or your access token which it gives
you which then allows you to connect it
to your account. So once you connect it
to your account, you want to just put
trigger on message which allows you to
be able to trigger the the actual
workflow on the message that you sent
it. So let's say I trigger this. So I go
here and I just I can write a text like
hey how are you?
I can then go inside and see that we got
a text saying hey how are you right and
this is a [music] text. Now we use a
switch node after this because a switch
node allows us to differentiate whether
the text or whether the message was in
audio whether it's a text because if
it's an audio we have to get the file
which because the audio itself turns
into a file and then give it to AI to
say hey we have an audio can you just
turn that into text so we can use it
okay because the input here has to be
text either way whether it's an audio
whether it's just text so we want to
make sure that we get text in the AI
agent in the CEO uh all the time so
switch here go inside and then We want
to make sure we're choosing basically a
field that only happens whenever we send
the audio. So what I mean by that is
let's say we send a text. In this case,
this is all the fields that we get,
right? Which is this message text. So we
know it's a text because this says text
because chat says text. But let's say I
did a voice message. So let me go here
and let me rerun it and let me say
hello, this is me. Hello. Hello. I can
then go here. I can see that it
triggered. We can see here that it's
voice. So when we go back here, we're
basically saying, hey, set of rules.
There's two different rules. If it's an
audio, so we know it's an audio because
we know that this variable exists, mime
type, and we know it's a text when text
exist, which we had before. So we're
spinning in two different ways. And
we're using again two different
variables. The ones here, right? This
looks like code, but it actually is just
me drag and dropping this one here.
Boom. Like this, right? And you will get
it there. Uh and then we are spinning
into different ways. So if it's an
audio, it goes here. If it's a text, it
will go here and then we'll send this.
So, this right here is just the text of
the message and it will send it both
ways to the AI agent. So, it'll route it
back and then bring it back to the same
place. So, the AI agent always gets
text. There's a few things we have to
set up for the main AI agent. The first
one is source for prompt which is a user
message. Now, the simplest way possible,
this is asking us basically what is a
thing that you want to feed in to the AI
agent. So, there's two options. The
first one is connect uh connected chat
notes. Let me zoom in. connected track
nodes which is basically saying do you
want to connect it to the chat node of
nitn which is because nitn has a native
chat node so we say no we're using
telegram so we just want to define it
below so we're defining it ourselves and
below which in this case is just json
text which is the text that we get from
telegram whether it's a voice whether
it's a text we always give it the same
thing and then we require specific
output format no it doesn't require any
specific output format because it
changes and then enable fallback method
this says hey since it's using an AI to
actually think. Uh it says if the AI
doesn't work, do you want to set another
fallback method? So it uses another AI.
Well, in this case, we don't need to. So
we can just leave it there. And now for
the most important part of the agent is
the system message. So this is the
instruction. So let me press this button
right here, which basically puts it full
screen. And this is the general
structure that you would give an AI
agent for it to actually work because a
prompt is the most important thing.
Without a prompting, without you giving
instructions to someone, how are they
meant to know what to do, right? So we
say we give it an overview. So you are
the ultimate personal assistant. Your
job is to send the users query to the
correct tool and these are the different
tools. So I state first tool and then
second tool and then third tool and then
content agent. So this is another tool
and then we give it some rules
instructions and then final reminder
here's the current date and time. So we
always give it the date and time because
AI isn't the best at um at guessing what
date of time it is. U I tried running it
before I said run a make an event for
tomorrow and it made an event for I
think 6 months ago. So not the best. Uh
and the structure is overall mainly the
same. We have the overview which is some
context. They have tools. So for the
tools itself we have contact agents. So
we say use this tool to take uh contact
actions. You must use this before
sending emails or creating calendar
events within attendees. So this is
where we go into prompting right which I
don't want to get too deep in but we're
basically saying hey before you use
something else use this. So let's say we
say hey can you send an email to James?
How does it know James email? Right? So
we're basically saying we're prompting
it saying hey before you send an email
before you create a calendar event just
go out to the contact database and find
the contacts which in this case is in a
Google sheet. So that's what we tell it
to do. And then we have the email agent
which is use this tool to take action in
email. That's simple. Then we have
calendar agent which is basically saying
use this tool to take action in the
calendar. I also reiterated. So I said
hey you must use a contact um agent
before using the calendar agent and make
sure you pass through the email of the
contact to the calendar agent. Now, this
only comes from actually testing the
agent and making sure that it works.
Because sometimes what it was giving me,
it was, you know, when I say send the
invite to the actual person, it was
sending me just the name. So, I said,
"Hey, no, that can't happen. Just send
me the email cuz that's the email is the
only thing that we can actually use to
send the invite." Then we have content
agents. So, use this tool to generate a
blog and return the full text. And then
we have rules here. And the rules are
basically going towards telling the AI
agent some rules that it needs to do.
And this is a difference between
proactive and reactive prompting.
Because reactive prompting is
essentially the uh the act of iterating.
So it means changing the prompt over
time as you're testing the agent. So
you're testing the agent. You see that
the email agent doesn't work for this
reason. You add a rule saying, "Hey, if
this works, uh do this." But you
wouldn't know it didn't work if you
didn't actually test it. So you always
want to do reactive prompting. Test the
agent and then add the rules. Uh that's
what you want to do. And then some
instructions and then final reminder
again. All right, cool. So this is the
prompt that we want to use and this is
the one that is going to use to then
decide which AI agent it's then going to
offload the task to. Now the main AI
agent is connected to a chat model. So
this is the brain the LLM that I was
talking about which in this case we use
chat GBT41 mini to connect your OpenAI.
You just have to go here create a new
credential and then you have to go to
the actual platform to openai. So you go
here
platform.opai.com
you log in. So you have to log in and
then you have to go to dashboard I
believe API keys on the left hand side
go here to create a new API key name it
so hello test YouTube 19th of August
leave this as you project is default and
then permissions is all it's fine create
a secret key and then copy this bring it
back to N&N
and this is the one you're going to put
here so API key let's do YouTube August
19th
You don't need this uh base URL is fine.
All you have to do is just press save
and you will see this green check mark
here which means that connection was
tested successfully. And bear in mind
that you need to add credits to OpenAI
for it to actually work. Um and I think
$5 should do. It's enough. Uh it's
exactly what I put I think 4 months ago
and now it's still going. Uh so it's
very very cheap. Now the model itself
4.1 mini is actually very very good. Uh
some models don't work for this AI agent
like two to actually run the AI agent.
For example 40 would not work. Uh so
leave this as 4.1 mini which is very
fast. Then we have think which is a new
node that was added recently which is
just used to add that extra person to
think. So it does everything and then it
consults. It's like a consultant. It
consults with the AI agent saying hey I
did all of this. Am I doing it right or
is this something that I'm getting
wrong? It will think through it and then
it will tell if something needs to
change. And then simple memories. If I
go in here I can see that we have a
session ID which will just be the chat
ID that we have with the agent. Then we
have context window length. This just
means how many text messages do you want
the AI to actually remember when it
gives you the output. Uh because let's
say I say, "Hey, can you send an email
to James?" Then it goes out and send the
email to James and says, "Hey, we're
done." And then you say, "Can you
actually schedule the calendar event
with him as well?" Now, it needs to
remember who James was, right? That we
actually said James for it to actually
do the thing. So, this is basically
saying if you put five, it will just
say, "Hey, remember the five past
conversations that we had with you." So,
that's what it means. And then here is
where the real sauce begins because we
have the contact agent, the email agent,
calendar agent, the content creation
[music] agent. All right. So the first
tool here, the first agent that is
hooked up with is the contact agent. Uh
now this right here again is the head of
contacts. What it will do is it will
call this tool to take action within the
contact database. So we add a
description which is what it is and then
we say the prompt. So the prompt is what
do we tell the agent to do in this case
we can define it automatically by the
model and then we give it a system
message which is exactly what we give it
in the main model overview which is you
are a contact manager you have tools to
take action within the contact database
uh the different tools you have is get
contacts you use this tool to get
contact information like address or
phone number and then add or update a
contact use this to add a new contact to
database or update an existing contact
so that's exactly what it does those
instructions allow it to think about
what it has to do and choose which tool
it needs to send the information to and
we also also have a model which is the
brain. So in this case the LLM which is
also hooked up to the main agent the
same. So in case we're using 41 mini
like I mentioned before then we have the
tools we have get contact and then we
have add or update contacts uh [music]
like you saw here in the system message.
So if I go here to the first tool we can
see that get contacts is hooked up to
Google sheets. So the first step you
have to do is go here create a new
credential and all you have to do is
sign in with Google. You can press this
button right here which will take you
through the main page uh right here with
Google which will basically allow you to
connect to any account that you want and
then you can bring it back. It's as easy
as that. You can bring it back and we're
already connected. So that's fine. Yes,
delete. And then you want to set this
automatically because we're allowing AI
to actually set the tool description. Uh
so what it actually needs to do and then
the resource will be the sheet within
the document because there's a sheet
that we're using which is a context
which is this one right here which all
the context in this case will be more
but these are the ones that we have now.
And then we have get rows because that's
the action that we have to do in this
case we're getting contacts from the
list. So which sheet are you using?
Which uh sorry which document are you
using? So which yeah which main sheet
are using. So in this case will be
contact database USB. And what sheet
within the sheet are we using so in this
case will be sheet one. And then you
want to leave this blank because we want
to let the AI figure it out. Now let's
test this. Let me show you exactly what
this uh just what this step does. Let me
go to Telegram. Let me execute the
workflow and say so this case we have
James Low.
say, "Hey, can you quickly
get me James Lowe's email?" So through
text, it will then talk to the main
agent. It will think, hey, what agent do
I need to use in order for me to do that
task. It will think and then it will
send it here and then this will then
send it here, bring it back, and then
give me the output. And it will say,
hey, James Lo's email address is $100
million peanuts. Uh, is there anything
else you want me to do? So this right
here, just use the agent. So you use
this tool right here to do this specific
task. So it will think through which
agent it will send it to. It will then
send it here and then based on what it's
told it will then think through exactly
which tool. So which employee is it
going to offload the task to in this
case the employee will be the get
contacts. And the same thing is update a
contact. So right here we can update the
contact here. Uh we're going to do the
same connection set automatically. Uh
this is all the same. The only thing you
want to change is you want to map the
column mode uh manually because you're
manually mapping each column. And then
it says based on because when we tell it
can you update or can you change
something it needs to know what it needs
to change. Sorry we want to match the
name to the name in the sheet to make
sure that it knows exactly which one is
updating and then it's updating the name
which is defined automatically by the
model the email or the phone number
right based on what it needs to update
and I give it a description as well. So
this is the name of the person the email
and the phone number and leave
everything else the same. So [music]
these two are called upon when it needs
to do the specific task. Now let's get
on to the email agent which is again the
same thing same same sort of setup. We
have the description so call this tool
to take action in email. Uh prompt which
would be defined by the model. Then we
have system message. So you're an email
assistant. You have tools to take action
in email. And then we have different
tools. So send get draft uh create a
reply create a draft and then get labels
uh actually label them. And then we have
rules and then final reminder. Uh in
this case for the different tools we
tell it we give it a small instruction.
So in this case, you have to use this to
send an email. You use this to get
emails. And we give it different rules
and different logic. And this all comes
from actually testing and making sure
that we know exactly what hasn't worked
[music] based on our test. And then what
can we add to the prompt to make sure
that it works every single time. Uh so
that's what we want there. And this is
basically it. So all the same for the
different agents. And then it's hooked
up to the opening brain, which again is
the same for every single agent. And
then it's hooked up to six different
tools. Send email, get emails, email
reply, create a draft, get labels, and
label emails. So in this case, it's go
to send emails. This will be the one
tool that will be used that will be
called upon when it needs to send an
email. So if I go to credentials right
here, all you have to do to connect your
Gmail to NN is go to create a new
credential. And just as we did for the
Google sheet, we just have to sign in
with Google. It will take you through
this page right here. You can just
choose which account you want to use.
And that's the one that will be brought
back here and it will be connected
automatically. Press delete. Let me go
here. So leave this set automatically.
The resource will be message because
that's the thing that we're actually
doing. The operation is basically what
action are we taking. So we want to send
in this case. And it's asking us who do
we send the email to? What's the subject
line? So email type, which is
essentially either HTML or text. In this
case, we just want to leave it to HTML
because if we want to send a blog over
email, then we wanted to have headers
and all that sort of stuff. And the only
way to have headers is to use HTML
instead of text. And then it's asking us
what message. So what's the body of the
email? So in this case, we're allowing
the model to actually think through
exactly and define who are we sending
the email to. So based on so let's say I
say, hey, send the email to James. It
will first of all get the contact, find
the email and then it's smart enough to
actually think about um what email do we
put here? In this case will be the email
of the contact that we just mentioned.
Subject line is the same. So we'll think
through the context that we give it. In
this case, let's say we we set it to
write an email about going out for
dinner. The subject line will be created
based on that context. And the same
thing with message. So let me test this
one right here so you get a feel of sort
of what it does just on this [music] uh
this right here. Let me execute
workflow. Let me pull up Telegram. and
we can say hey can you send
an email to him. So in this case we're
actually testing the memory itself um
saying
uh you are fired.
There you go. So let me execute the
workflow. So it will think through what
it needs to do. It will then know that
it needs to use his email agent to send
the email bring it back to telegram. So
if I go to my email here, I can see that
I sent an email to $100 million peanuts
saying you are fired and the subject
line was already chosen by the model. So
that's exactly what it does. So based on
what it was instructed to do, it will
choose which tool it will use. This
setup is very much the same as the other
tools. So if we go to get many, the
connection is the same, set
automatically, message the same. In this
case, you want to change this from send
to get many because you want to get the
different emails that we needs to get.
Uh return all, just let the AI handle
this. it will define whether it needs to
return all or just one um or what it
needs to return in this case and then
the sender. So defined automatically by
the model and we also give it a
description. So it sort of has the
guardrails when he needs to think about
uh who is the sender. So in this case it
can be a sender's name or email address
when he needs to pull information. And
then same thing with email reply. So in
this case we have message then we have
reply. The message ID will be obviously
the message that we previously got that
we're replying to. And then we leave
this as HTML just to make the email look
pretty if it needs to in case you're
sending a blog. And then the message
here will be the body. Turn this off
because then we don't have to see end on
the email. Same thing with create a
draft. So in this case, instead of
message, you can put draft. Create for
operations. That's the actual thing that
we're doing. This is a subject line. So
we let it define by the model. So we
just press this button right here. Or
you can simply add bracket bracket
dollar sign from AI and then you put
subject. this is the variable that we're
pulling in or you can just do this and
then you can leave this as HTML and then
message is defined by the model and then
whoever sending the email to as a drop
is defined by the model as well. Same
thing with get labels. We're just
getting labels. So label and get many
and return all will be defined by the
model and then label emails as well. Um
because this right here is a two-step
operation because we're first getting
emails to then label the email. In this
case, it will be the message add label.
Message ID will be the ID of that
specific thread of email. And then label
names or ids will be the ones that will
be pulled in from this right here
because before this acts, this one
happens before uh cuz it needs to again
get labels before using the labels that
it was given to then do the thing. Uh
then we go to calendar agent. Very
similar setup. We have the description,
the prompt which is defined by the
model. And we go here and we can see
that this is a system message. So this
is the instructions that we give the AI
agent uh in thinking through what he
needs to do. Again very very similar
setup as the one we have before overview
tools and final reminder. Uh and most
importantly here we have date and time
because again AI is just the worst at
thinking through the times and the
dates. And now I will think through what
he needs to do and then it's hooked up
to five different tools. So we have
create an event with attendee. So this
is basically creating an event with
someone right um which is exactly what I
showed you at the start of the video. In
order to connect your Google calendar to
an endn you have to do is create in your
credential. You go here, sign in with
Google. It will take you through this
page. Choose the account that you want.
And this is will be the one that will be
connected here. And then you want to put
the resources event because it's an
event, right? Uh create because that's a
task that we're doing. That's the action
that we're doing. We're creating
something. The calendar will be your
calendar. And then it's going to ask you
for the start and end date. So let's say
I tell it to schedule an event for
tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. It will choose the
start date and it will also choose the
end date. So you see how before it chose
the 8:00 p.m. 1 hour time frame. I
didn't tell it to. The AI automatically
did it. Right? This is what it is.
Default reminders if this is on because
then Google calendar can choose its own
reminders. And then it's going to ask us
who the attendees are. The attendees are
basically the people that are going to
be invited to that specific event that
we're doing. We're also giving it a
description and the summary as well. All
defined by the model itself because it
will be smart enough to know that it
will give the email, right? And we tell
it description as well. And the summary
will be defined automatically by the
model as well. And then let me actually
do this. Let me actually show you just
this mode right here. So you can see
exactly the flow that it goes through.
to just get contact and then do this.
Let me go here and let me say, can you
create an event for tomorrow? God, my
spelling is horrible. Event tomorrow at
6 p.m.
and invite him. Yeah, that's it.
Boom.
Then I'm waiting for it to do. It will
think through what it needs to It will
create the event. It will then give me a
response. If I go to my Google calendar,
I can see that event with James Low was
done at 6 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Again, it
was smart enough to think that it's just
a 1 hour slot. But of course, it was
given it was given the context. It it
wasn't given a 1 hour thing. So, it will
think through exactly what it needs to
do. It will just choose the 1 hour and
add it there. It will send me the invite
as well. That's cool. And that's uh what
this tool does. And the same setup is
for create an event without the
attendee. So everything's the same apart
from the fact that we just don't add any
attendees here. Get events is the same.
So in this case, uh we're just changing
this to get many. So let's say we go
here to Telegram and we ask it uh let me
just execute the workflow. We ask it
what events
do I have
this week. So now we'll think through
what it has to do. It will then think
through what it needs to use. It first
it will get the events and bring it all
back to Telegram. So right here it would
tell me that I have the altco workshop
this weekend James Low dinner in Rome
and workshop again. So this right here
is something that I had was it yesterday
at 1:00 a.m. Yeah, yesterday 1:00 a.m.
So that's why it's telling me that it's
from this week as well. And that's how
this tool works. So get an event and
then we have deleted events which is
again the same. The only thing we have
to change is the event and delete
calendar will be ours. Then it's asking
us for the event ID. It's sort of the
same as replying to an email because you
need to know the email ID first of the
one that you're replying to to then
reply. in this case is asking us what is
the event ID? What is the event that
we're deleting? And what's the ID
because that's unique identifier for
that specific event. That's what we
need. So we want to define it
automatically by the model which again
all of these this right here wasn't
before. It wasn't here before. But now
because the models got smarter, we're
able to let AI actually do it and let it
handle it. And that's fine. [music] And
then we have update an event which will
be same connection set automatically
event which will be update in this case.
Uh same calendar event ID which is the
same as before. you use default
reminders and now we give it a start and
end date which is the same as before. Uh
we're basically saying hey this is a
start and this is the end right of the
of the time frame that you want to
update. So that right there is for the
calendar agent and then we go on to the
content creation agent. So in this case
we have description. So call this tool
to create a blog post. The prompt is
automatically decided by the model. It
doesn't require any outputs format the
fallback model. We don't need this and
then we just have to use the system
message which in this case is you are an
expert blog writer. Use the appropriate
tool to write a blog post. In this case,
the only tool we have is Propexity,
which should be used to actually do the
research before we actually write the
blog post. Um, again, this is exactly
what I told it to do. And then some
rules are that your blog post should be
less than 500 words because we don't
want it to be too big. And also, it
can't send more than 500 words or I
mean, I don't know how much it can send.
I don't know what the limit is, but on
Telegram, it can't send a blog post to
back to Telegram with more than X words.
So, we're just cutting it out. And uh,
we're also saying output the whole blog
text. And [music] then final reminder,
we just give it the date and time in
case it needs to know. So that's right
there is the system prompt that we tell
the content creation agent to do. Then
we actually hook it up to claude. So you
see here we use open AAI, open AI, open
AAI. Well, the reason why we're using
Claude in this case is because Claude is
extensively better at understanding and
making content. It's much better at
using words and creating words and
creating feelings out of words. That's
like the best way that I like to think
about it. So that's the way you use
Claude. If I go here, the way to connect
your Claude is create a new credential.
And all you have to do is you have to go
through anthropic console. So let me go
here. anthropic console. You want to log
in and then you want to get your API key
right here.
Create a key. Name it whatever you want.
So let's do test n
agent. Add copy the key. This will be
the one that you use to actually set
back here. Right? And then you'll save
it. So now you connected your cloud. And
then you can leave this as claude for
set. And now you want to hook up
perplexity to do the research for this
agent to make the blog post. So the way
that we do that is press plus app
perplexity tool and then we go here
connected. So in this case the way that
we connected is go here and then in
perplexity we go here we can see that
down below to the account we go to API
API keys we can create a new key right
or you can just copy here the ones you
already made and this will be the one
that you then copy paste in here API key
to connect it set automatically message
a model because that's the thing that
we're doing. Uh, sonar pro is the model
that we're using. Um, you can use any
other model. I think this is fine,
relatively fast. And then the messages
is what is the prompt that we tell the
AI to do. So what is the thing that we
tell it to research and we're letting
this define it by the [music] model
based on the context that we give. And
then we'll leave it as user prompt
because the user prompt is essentially
your task is to do XYZ and it's fine.
And then we have maximum number of
tokens which will be automatically
defined by the model which just means
that when a blog is very very long and a
lot of words come out of it. It's
usually token intensive which means that
it takes up a lot of API credits. It's
more expensive right? Uh so we just
wanted to uh let the AI handle the
maximum number of tokens but we already
told it to only do 500 words. So the
tokens are already restricted as to how
many we're using them. So that's fine
and that's the thing that we're going to
use for perplexity. So let's actually
test this because I haven't tested the
content agents. Let me go here. execute
workflow. Let me go to Telegram. Can you
send me a blog about
why the Roman times
were the best
compared to now some random Okay,
so we have here it will then think
through what it needs to use. It will
then know that it needs to use the
content creation agent. It will talk to
anthropic then perplexity to do the
research. Again, it has different
rounds. So it does different types of
research and it does take a bit longer
than the others just because it is
content creation is more uh time
intensive. Now it's going back here.
It's thinking through what it needs to
use. It'll now it will now format it in
the right way. So we can send it to
Telegram. And if I go here I can see
that we have a blog about why Roman
times were better than convert. I'm
actually interested to see what it says.
Why the glory our age phones. Okay. It
will probably say some some stuff that
um like smartphones are bad for you and
whatnot. Uh but yeah, this is the whole
blog that we have all automatically
within what just a few seconds. Well, I
mean like 20 seconds, right? Uh so
that's what we get there. And this is
the [music] way that we set up the
content creation agent. But essentially
what this is again is a multi-step
agent. It's one agent that we talk to
through Telegram through an input and an
output that has a memory uh right here
that has a brain which is the LLM. And
then it has different tools. The tools
are the things that it calls when it
needs to do something. Right? In this
case, if it needs to get a contact, it
will talk to this tool again, head of
department of contacts, head of emails,
head of calendar, head of content, and
then from there, it actually execute the
task, sends a response, and sends it
back here and then gives it to us in a
in a very clean natural language English
way. Right? That's what it does. So,
that right there is a full walkthrough
of the AI agent that I built inside of
NN that manages my contacts, calendar,
emails, and even drops my content.
In today's video, I'm going to show you
step by step how I built a self-learning
AI agent inside of Nitn that stores
long-term memory. It remembers past
[music] conversations from tools like
Telegram and even improves itself over
time by writing new memories to our
database. All right, so the first thing
I want to do is actually show you the
live action of how it works. On the left
hand side, we have Telegram because
Telegram is sort of like WhatsApp
iMessage that you text the AI agent for
it to actually do something. On the
right hand side here we have uh in the
middle we have the AI agent in and right
here we have the memory database. So
database just stands for a place where
you put stuff right in this case is
going to be a Google sheet and this is
where we're going to store information
for the AI agent to extract over time as
it's giving us answers. So I'm going to
say well I mean I like football. My
brother's name is James. I'm from Italy.
So, let's do what sport do I like.
In this case, it's talking to the
memory. It extracted all the information
and now it tells us that I like to play
football. Need some tips to want to talk
to about strategies. What the hell, man?
Okay, there you go. All right, cool. And
we can ask any other questions. So,
let's say I wanted to ask um I also like
dogs.
So, let me run this first and then let
me put the message here and let me press
go. This will now this should add it to
our database. You should see it right
here. User also likes dogs. As you can
see, it's adding information over time
about the user so that it comes to a
place where you can ask any questions
about yourself or whatever it is or even
your business or your life in general.
And it has context, right? It has a
database full of contextualized
information of who you are, what you
are, and sort of what what it is that
you're about. Um, and different pieces
of information like this that it kind of
used to give you answers, right? Right?
So, it's much better than just a normal
AI agent that has no context to you. All
right. So, before I get to explaining
the whole AI agent in Niten step by
step, I want to go through and show you
how this looks like in chat GBT. And
you're probably asking yourself, why is
this even relevant? Well, the AI agent
that we're building today is an AI agent
that has memory on you and that updates
itself over time so that when it gives
you answers, it has context. You don't
have to repeat yourself. Now, with
Trabt, we can go to our profile. We can
go to I believe it's settings
personalization. If you scroll all the
way down, you can see here that it has
memory. Right now it's 89% full, which
means that the memory of me that it has
is 89% full and it goes to 100 and it
can't add more information. And if I go
to manage, I can see now that it has
different pieces of information right
here about me that it extracted or that
it got from the conversations that I've
had with it. Now, this is really, really
powerful because it allows it to
reference save memories when responding
and reference chat history as well, so
that every single time you go to try,
you don't have to reexlain who you are,
what you've done, what your business is,
and so on. Uh, but the only caveat to
this is that it has a storage, right?
And a storage isn't a crazy amount of
information that you can add there. Uh,
but it is still good to have when you
want to ask JP any questions. So, I
wanted to give you this as context when
we explain how the AI agent actually
works on any. Now I drew up this diagram
right here which is the easiest way for
me to explain all these concepts because
it can get a bit overwhelming with all
this database storage extract
information XYZ but to put it in a
simple way what it is it's an AI agent
that has an input okay so we have an
input which is telegram hey can you do
XYZ what it does as a first step is that
it retrieves the information okay so we
have this database right here which is
called the memory AI agent which has
different rows and all these different
rows are pieces of information that has
about us and this is what it will use to
then give us or use as context to then
give us the answer, right? And so that's
what this is right here. And when you
hear database, it just means an air
table, it means a notion, it means a
Google sheet, right? Just so you can
store data. Then what it does is that it
sends the input plus the retrieved
information. So the memory all to the AI
agent and what the AI agent does is the
follows. It looks at the information
that it got and it thinks through
itself. Is this something that is worth
me adding to the memory database based
on the input or is it simply just a
question or statement that we just need
to answer based on the context that we
got. So let's say I ask it like before I
ask it hey what sport do I like to play
right it says user like to play sports
what it does or user like to play
football the input is what sports do I
play that's a question it retrieves all
the information from the database well
clearly the AI agent knows that this
isn't a new piece of information this is
just a question that we can simply
answer using the database that we have
here so what it does is that it goes
straight here and it generates a
contextualized answer contextualized
just means that it has context in this
case the context is the database of
memory of
right and gives us the answer and then
the output is uh the output to the user.
So in telegram we get an answer back
saying hey or it just gives us the
answer right like just like a general
chatbot. Now there is that case where we
give it information. So we can say hey
my mom's name is Janette or whatever it
is we give it here. Now the AI agent
will have to classify whether that's
worthy of putting to the memory
database. If it is then it adds the new
information there right and it goes
here. And so what it becomes is like an
infinite loop that it goes like round
and round and round and it keeps getting
smarter and smarter and smarter. That's
why we call it a self-learning AI agent
because it self-learns, right? It
self-learns based on the questions and
and statements and the conversations
that we give it. So in Nit right here,
essentially how it works is that the
first part is the input. Okay? So all
these notes that you see are actually
quite easy. I'll take you through
exactly what it is. Uh the first step is
a telegram trigger. So this trigger
right here is able for us to get
messages. Right? So when I run this, let
me go here. Let me execute workflow
execute step. And I can pull up Telegram
and let's say I say my business name is
JM Solutions and we help companies be
more efficient um in their own workflows
using AI and automations. I can press
go. What this will now do as you can see
it triggered which means that it send
the information here for us to start the
conversation because a chatbot or an AI
agent needs to have an input right like
what is the thing that we're actually
processing what is the information that
we're processing and then an output
which is giving us the answer back. So
right here in the schema version which
is the normal person version we can see
that the text here is my business jam
solutions xyz. So now that we have this
part we send it two different ways. So
the first way will be to extract the
memory from here because you're always
extracting it over and over again right
so we have all these pieces of
information that we give as context.
This is the first step that we do. So we
just connect it to the get rows in sheet
which means that it gets all the rows
from the memory AI agent to Google sheet
right here.
By the way, to connect your Google
sheet, you have to go here, sign in with
Google. That's it. And then we have to
do sheet one and leave all the filters
alone because in this case, we're just
getting all the rows and then we're
giving it to the AI agent. Now, the only
thing about this is, let me just pin
this. So, if I pin this, I don't have to
rerun the whole thing again. The only
thing about this is that it gives it to
us in nine items. Okay, so for those of
you who are not familiar with how
arrays, iterating, aggregating works,
it's actually quite easy. So as you can
see here
what this looks like is that this has
nine rows. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 right.
These nine rows are the ones that we get
right. So in logic if we tell to Google
sheet hey can you get all the rows it
gets nine. The only problem with that is
that it then processes each row
individually. And that's not something
that we want. We want it all to be in
one place as in we get all these pieces
of information all the rows and it makes
it into sort of like a paragraph that it
then gives the AI agent as context. And
so to do that to make it into a
paragraph or to make it into we call it
we to aggregate it right we use the
aggregate node. So as you can see here
by the diagram we're basically getting
all these nine rows and we're merging
them. So we're putting all in one place
to then give uh to ChibiT as or to the
AI agent in this case as context. So we
use the aggregate node individual fields
because we're doing individual fields
and then the input field name will be
the memory because this is the memory.
All I did here is I just drag this
across right and so if I execute the
step what it will now do is that it will
take the nine items because before you
can see here it's nine items. I can't
see all of them in the same place. Well,
see here we put them all together and
now this will be the thing that we give
to chat GBT or to the AI agent in order
for it to get context before giving us
the answer. Right? And that's all we do.
So that's the first part and that's what
we give as the first input to the AI
agent. The second input here is uh the
telegram. So all this is is saying hey
we can either give you text or we can
give you audio messages, right? So if
it's a text we send it here. If it's an
auto message, we send it here. So the
switch node, this is basically a node.
So like a square that allows us to send
the automation two different ways based
on something. In this case, the filter
or the condition is if this variable
exists, which is audio, then we send it
one way to extract the audio to make the
audio into text and then send it to the
AI agent. But if this variable exists,
then what we do is we send it to the
text way and it just simply goes
straight to the AI agent. Now, how do we
know what variables to use? Well, in
this case, we know that whenever we do
an audio, we get this variable. So, let
me actually test this and show you
exactly what I mean. Just so I'm not
waffling. Uh, let me do this. There you
go. I can execute the step.
Why did not work? Oh, right. Cuz it's
pinned. Let me unpin this. Let me go
here. Execute step.
Okay. Again, execute step. Never mind.
Again, execute step. Let me go here
execute workflow. So we'll now put a new
message and let me go to telegram. Let
me say let me put it here. Me say um
hello hello hello hello. What this will
now do is it will send the information
from telegram to the switch node. And
now you can see that this is green
because that was a voice message. So we
know it's a voice message because this
variable right here or here or here or
here or here, right? These are only
present if it's a voice message.
And the same thing with text. This
variable is only important when it's a
text message. And so what we do here is
we split it out. So we're saying, hey,
if it's a text, send it here. If it's an
audio, send it here. Now, if it's an
audio, we have to get a file because it
is a file. And the file has a file ID.
So file get and then the file ID you can
find right here. File
to then download it to then give it to
AI to transcribe the recording. So to
connect your OpenAI, you have to go
here. You need an API key. You can
simply go to platform.opai.com.
Go to is it dashboard? Yeah. Go to API
keys. Press this button right here. Name
it. So nitn
test. I think I've made like 30,000 of
these. Uh and then you can copy the key.
And that's what you bring back to the uh
nitan. Important thing here is that this
is not free as in you do have to pay,
but lucky for you, this is not expensive
at all. Um, you can add $5 of credits
per your credit card here and just leave
it as is this. $5 can last you a long
while. Obviously, it depends on how much
you use it, but this is like fraction of
cents when you run it, so it's not
noticeable. Um, okay. Once you connected
your OpenAI, now you can transcribe the
recording and audio and the input data
field name, which is what is the thing
that we're giving OpenAI to take as
audio and turn into text. Well, that's
data because if I test this, I go here.
So I put this we can see that the output
is data and that is the input on the
next node data. We just drag this across
and we get this. So now if I execute the
step I should be able to see hello hello
hello hello. There we go which is the
audio that we give telegram. And that's
the first input. The second input is
simply text. And we turn this to text
JSON message of text because because
this is very important because when we
send the input here and the input here
we want the output of both of these to
be similar or to be the exact same named
variable. Right? What that means is that
the output here is text. [music] So we
also want the output here to be text. So
instead of message of text because this
wouldn't be present here in the audio,
it would have to be something that we
can manipulate here.
text, right? So now we have both the
inputs are basically the same variable
but it sends it different ways based on
the input that we give it whether it's a
voice message whether it's a text. Now
we have the merge node which merges so
all possible combinations. What this
does is that it takes this it takes the
uh telegram input and now if I execute
the step.
So let me actually did it work? No it
didn't work. Uh so let me actually start
from from scratch here so I can show you
exactly what that looks like. execute
workflow and let me unpin this go to
telegram
and I can say
what is my brother's
name right now this goes here it
extracts all the memory so you see how
nine items went through here and only
one came out because it it put them all
together and now this went this way
because it was text and in the merge
node what this did is that it merged
let's from the emerged the text from
telegram and also the memory. So these
two pieces of information are the ones
that are going to be directly given to
the AI agent to do its own thing. All
right, enough of that. That was the
boring part. Uh now we get to the fun
part which is the actual AI agent. So
this is the thing that will think
through its answers. It will then call
the the Google sheet tool to add memory
and uh yeah so the first thing we have
to do is actually define the input. So
the input in this case will be JSON.ext
text. And this is the one right here
because this is the one from Telegram.
The one from Telegram is the actual
thing, the user message because the user
sent us a message and that's the thing
that we sent to this here. Now, we have
the system message and the system
prompt. Now, I'm going to show you at
the end of the video how to get the
whole system for free. So, don't worry,
you'll have this whole prompt, but what
it actually tells it is an overview, so
memory handling, so some rules and
stuff, response styles, the context
awareness, and basically telling it,
hey, you're getting this memory.
basically use the memory tool when you
have to add a new memory. Don't feel
forced to use memories only when they
add value. And that's why we're giving
AI sort of that task to to think through
is this worth putting in the memory
database. If yes, put it. If not, then
just answer the question and so on. Um,
and then we give it a few rules, right?
The example format and even the current
date and time because AI is not good at
determining date and times. So, we give
that as well. So, again, you get the
whole prompt for free at the end of the
video, so don't worry. But this right
here is really the source of the whole
system because the prompt is a thing
that really gives the instructions to
the AI agent. So if you don't instruct
it well then you won't get the output
that you want. All right. So once this
is done we added the system message and
the user message. Now we have to connect
the chat model. So the chat model is
basically the brain. In this case we
have to use open AI. Again follow the
same process before to connect your
OpenAI. I mean if you connected it
before you'll have the same connection
here. Uh the model you can use 4.1 Mini.
That's good enough. Then we have the
memory which is able to remember the
actual conversation on chat. This isn't
this kind of memory. Uh this memory is
just for conversations on telegram.
And then we have our nice tool right
here which is connected to again the
same exact database memory AI agent. And
the only action it takes is just adding
more and more and more and more and
more. So you basically just feed it more
and more memories more and more sort of
details about yourself as context and
the memory itself. So the values to send
is just a memory and all we do here is
just press this button because we're
letting any define what is a thing or
how do we want to structure the input
for example here I didn't tell user also
likes dogs I told you hey can you also
add that I like dogs right and so what
it did is that we let AI define what
goes in here and AI define that it
should put it in this way user also like
dogs so that it's easier for for the
actual system to know exactly what I'm
talking about right and once this is
done we have the tool connected
And this is where we actually add the uh
the piece of information. So let me run
this and I can show you exactly how this
looks. Let me go here.
In this case, what we can do is we can
say I also own a MVA team
called
Dallas Turtis.
Wish that existed. Uh what this did is
that now I called the tool. So now I
should see here that it says user owns
an NBA team called Dallas Tories, right?
And that is giving us context for the
future things and that's why we call it
self-learning, right? That's all it is.
Self-learning just means that it learns
over time. And so that's the reason why
we connect this tool right here to the
AI agent given the context as well. And
then finally, we connect this to the
response of Telegram. So to connect your
Telegram account, I didn't mention this
before, but all you have to do is you
have to ask the assistant AI uh cuz it
has a whole process. So these right here
are the steps you have to follow. For
the sake of time, I'm not going to
connect it now. Um but if you follow
these, you'll be fine. And you just have
to press this button right here. And now
we can put message, which is what is the
thing that we're manipulating or
changing. And the operation, which is
what is the action that we're taking. In
this case, it's sending a message, but
you can do a bunch of stuff.
And then the chat ID is the ID of the
chat, right? Logically, that's what it
is. But the way that Telegram works is
that every conversation that you have
has an ID attached to it. Right? And so
if we get an input from this ID, then we
have to give the output to that ID. So
logically, if we get an input from this
ID, then we have to give back the output
to that ID because then it's in the same
conversation. And then the text will be
the JSON.output, which is the one here.
So I just drag this across.
So you can see here it says, got it,
bro. I just added you um that you own an
NBA team called Dallas. Anything else
you want to add or chat about? What the
hell, man? There you go. And everything
else keep the same. So now when we get
the output, this is the message that we
come back to Telegram uh to do its own
thing. And now you got to see exactly
how it works. But this is a very
simplistic version of a self-learning
agent. I mean, we're using Google
Sheets. Typically, you wouldn't use
Google Sheets. You maybe have an Air
Table or even a rag database, right, to
store these different pieces of
information. Uh but you got to see the
the theory, right? The theory behind it,
how it actually works, how it functions.
So now you can apply this to any kind of
other database tool to store information
and have that retrieve it every single
time that it gives you answers.
Hey, I'm about to show you how I built
an AI resume screening agent in Anen
that allows applicants to put their CVs
and apply for a job. What it does is
that it then extracts the text from that
CV. It then matches the text of that CV
to another PDF which contains the
requirements of what a good applicant
looks like for that specific job. Then
it uses an AI agent in order to score
the applicant based on the different
criterias. Then it sends a confirmation
email to the applicant itself before
adding it to our notion database. All
right, I want to show you the full
system first before we go step by step
into how it works. Uh just so you can
see the output. I want to press execute
workflow and this would be the form that
the applicant would fill out. All right.
So, I just finished the application and
also important to know that the job that
we're applying for is an investment
banking form or job, right? Um, so bear
in mind because the CV is tailored
towards that job. I'm going to press
submit. What this will now do is it will
go to Google Drive. It will upload the
resume. It will download the resume to
then extract the text. It will then go
to this folder right here which contains
a document which basically outlines the
qualification uh for that specific job
before giving it to the AI agent. the
text of the qualification plus the text
of our CV before scoring it and sending
the applicant confirmation email and
then adding it to our notion database.
So if I go to my email here, I can see
that I have thank you for your
application. Hi Mikuela, thanks for
applying. We received your application
and our team will review it shortly.
We'll get back to you soon with the next
steps. Best GM solutions. Obviously, we
can remove this which is the N10
attribution and I'll show you exactly
how to do that. But just so you know, we
got it here. And if I go to my tracker,
I should be able to see myself in the
high ranking where we have Mike Torti,
Mik Torti, email, phone number. Not only
that, but we get to see the resume link.
We get to see the strength, the
weaknesses, the risk factor, the reward
factor, which are all different pieces
of information. That's really, really,
really important for someone to then go
in and see exactly why they got scored
eight out of 10. Why are they a high
ranking applicant versus a medium or a
low ranking applicant? Like what is that
thing that differentiates them and gives
us data based on that? Okay, so with
that said, let's go step by step into
the system and how it works. And if you
want the full system for free, make sure
to check out the first link down below,
which takes you to my free school
community right here. Then you go to
classroom, go to the templates vault,
and then you'll be able to see the AI ré
screening agent. Press this button to
download it and then import it into your
own account. And if you have no clue how
to do that, no worries at all. You can
also go here, zoom in, and you will have
a tutorial right here. And by the way,
if you apply and you get in, you also
get access to the AI automations 101
course, which is a comprehensive guide
that takes you from a real beginner in
AI automation to someone is able to
build automations for themselves or for
other businesses. All right, so let's go
through this step by step and I'll walk
you through my thought process as I
wanted to build this. Um, I basically
wanted a system that could process
résumés, right? And so when we think of
structuring a system, we always think in
inputs and outputs, right? If I go here
to my miro, which is where I basically
map everything out, um the input in this
case would be the application, but
realistically it would just be the CV,
right? Cuz that's the thing that we're
that we're going towards. And the output
would be really data like results and
data on this CV based on job, right?
Qualification.
So it's basically saying, hey, we have a
CV. How well did it compare to that job?
uh from the CV that we have. So they
input a CV and the last thing is this
which is typically what a HR role is is
just simply to look at the applicant are
they good enough or are they not good
enough. Uh now the next step here is to
obviously extract the text. There's a
few steps before but extract text from
CV
then match
against
qualification
and then we want to use AI agent to
score right this is why I do this then
we want to send applicant email to be
connected this to be connected right
here right here and then we get the
results and data on a CV based on job
clarification which will then be added
to our notion database. Cool. This is
important because this is how you
structure systems like how do we think
about doing things like what is that
sequential order that we go through when
building these automations. Now the CV
itself has to be an input coming from
somewhere. It can be a Google drive, it
can be a Google form, it can be in this
case an end [music] to end form, a
native form uh where someone can just
submit it and just give us the CV which
then kicks off the um well you could say
the automation, right? And so the first
step to this automation is a job
application. It's us actually getting
the details. So if I go in here, I can
see that we have job application. Please
fill out this form right here. Uh we
have the full name, the email, the phone
number, and then the resume. So the
resume is really the thing that we I
mean we care about the others as well,
right? Because we have to know their
name. But the resume is the thing that
we actually use to be able to then score
the applicant based on the
qualifications for that job. And [music]
so the way that we do this is make sure
that the element type. So this is
saying, hey, what is the kind of
response format that we want from this
field? In this case, it's a file. It's a
bunch of fields that you can use. But in
this case, it's a file because we want a
file from the applicant. Multiple files.
This is saying, hey, do we accept
multiple files? Honestly, I don't know
why I have this on. I'll typically have
this off because a CV is one uh and we
don't want multiple CVs to them because
it's one applicant. Um, and then the
accepted file types you can leave empty
to allow all the types of files. So it
can be a PNG image, JPG, can be a H EIC,
but it could also be a PDF. In this
case, uh I would just like a PDF version
because that's the best way that we can
use to then be able to extract the text
and I guess compare it to the other one.
Um and that's it. So we have a form
which looks like this. Full name, email,
phone number, and resume. And resume, as
you can see, makes you choose a file,
and it doesn't let you choose
everything. It only lets you choose the
things that are PDFs, which is great.
All right, cool. Um, so once this is
done, the first part is obviously
connecting our Google Drive to Nitn.
[music] You have to go right here,
create a new credential, and you need a
client ID and client secret. For the
sake of time, I'm not going to go into
this, but you can check out this video
up here if you want to um see how you
can do that, which will take like 5
minutes. Uh, [music] and then we want to
do file upload resume because that is
the name of the file that we get. The
file name will be the person's name /
CV. And then you could add it to a a
folder called résumés or uh new
applicant rums. Right? For in this case,
the root folder will be no folder. It
will be anywhere in the Google Drive.
But you could obviously put it in a
folder if you want everything organized
in one place. After this, uh in order
for us to be able to extract the text
from the CV, first have to upload it.
Then we have to download it. So we're
downloading the file which you can find
right here ID and that's the thing that
we use to then download the file using
the same connection right and we get the
data and this is what we're able to then
pull through to the next node which is
extract from file so we're extracting
text from a PDF and fundamentally the
reason why we're doing these steps
before adding it to the AI agent is
because we can't give the AI agent two
files right which is why we have to
download well upload them in this case
download them and extract the text right
from the PDF and in this case the
operation which is what is the action
that we're taking is extract from PDF
the input binary field because this is
binary when a file is uploaded and is
downloaded it's binary uh that's just a
format and then the data itself is the
data right which is this one right here
always match this with this as you can
see here the output will be text that
will then be used right that we have
here now once Once this is done, this is
the first step when we actually have to
extract the text from the CV that we're
getting from the applicant because
that's the first step. The second step
is this. So we have this Google uh drive
folder and this is where this part comes
in, right? Matching against
qualifications. So when you have to
match a CV against qualifications, you
can either add the qualifications or
rules in the EI agent or you can simply
just have another document which can be
as long as you want that will then be
used. extract the text from here of
course and then we use to match the text
of the CV that we then give to the AI
agent to then qualify the applicant and
give us the results right and so what we
do in this step is we have the CV from
the applicant we basically turn that
into text then we have the initial job
which is this one right here from this
folder and the reason why we're doing it
in a Google Drive folder is because we
can then add more files and we don't
have to change this one right here the
prompt here because the prompt will be
dynamic based on the um the thing here
and we're downloading it, right? Which
is the investment banking interim PDF,
which again is the qualifications like
what does good look like for this job.
We extract the text from here because
we're extracting the text to then have
the second pillar because you have the
CV and then we have what does good look
like for that specific job. And then
these two pieces of data because again
here will be job description will then
be used to send to the AI agent. Okay.
And this is where we start to analyze
the CV. So again, we get the CV text and
then get the job applications, which is
what does good look like for that
specific job. It then turns that into
text. So we have two pieces of text and
then add all of that into the AI agent.
If I go in here, I can see that the
prompt that I have is a user prompt and
a system prompt. The first step here is
making sure that we have defined below
because we want to define exactly what
the input is. This is not a chat to the
AI agent type agent. And so the user
prompt in this case is like what is the
information that we give the EI agent
for it to actually think through through
its system message what it needs to do,
right? And so the prompt that we give it
is a candidates's resume which we pull
in from the first extract from file
which is the text right here. Pull it
through and the [snorts] job description
requirements which you get which is one
here and you put it here. Right? So we
have the candle resume and the job
description rs and we turn this on. So
require specific output format and I'll
show you exactly why we do that. But the
system message is really the thing that
matters the most and this is quite
extensive. We have the overview. So
you're an expert technical recruiter
specializing in XYZ. The output should
be in the following exact formats. So we
have candidic strength, weaknesses, risk
factor, reward factor, overall fit and
justification for rating. So these are
the different pieces of uh information
that we want. from the AI to do. So it's
an extensive analysis of both the CV and
the qualification of what it looks to be
good for that specific job. And then we
give the job description here which
again is basically like a double input
because we give it also here. Um I don't
think you have to give it in both ways
but you can. Now one important thing is
that I did tell it to give me the output
as candidate strength which is one
variable weakness another one risk
factor reward factor and overall fit and
justification. So, six variables. When
we give AI the ability to give us six
variables, we want the output to look
like this, right? And for the output to
look like this, we have to get it in a
very, very specific format. And in order
for us to get something in a very
specific format, we have to make sure
that we have a structured output parser.
So, this is saying, hey, this is a data
that's unstructured. That's a block of
text, right, which contains weaknesses,
strength, XYZ. And then we run it
through this right here, this code,
which is defined using JSON. And if
you're looking at this and thinking what
even is this, it's actually quite easy.
Uh so don't worry. But what it is, it's
JSON that tells us hey we want the
output in description. We want the
candidic strength. We want the
weaknesses. We want the um the risk
factor which is an object explanation
which is a string. So these are all
different types of variables and we give
the explanation of what each one does,
right? With the description, description
and so on. And so [music] what happens
here is that it first talks to his chat
model which you connect here. Go to
OpenAI
and then connect to OpenAI by going to
platform.opai.com.
You can go to dashboard right here. You
can go to API keys. Create a new secret
key. Make a key right here. And then you
paste that key back into NN right. And
then you press save and you connect it.
GPT4.1 Mini is great. Once you have this
connected, right, this is the thing that
it will use to then think through
exactly what the rating could be. Yeah,
how I would rate the applicant based on
the requirements for that job. And so
again, we get two different pieces of
information here. It then ranks or then
rates this. And let me show you exactly
what if we don't have this pin this pin.
I believe you can pin this. Okay, cool.
Here I can execute step. Please unpin
extract text and try again. Okay, I
think I have to start from zero. That's
okay. That is okay. That is okay. I will
start from zero. Let's do it. Let me
unpin this or let me extract that.
[music] Let me go here. Let me put a CV.
Just submit this. Put some random email.
I just want you to see exactly like what
it would look like if we didn't have
this. Plus, when we do have this. So,
it's doing everything that we want. And
now the AI agent will all right. So, you
can see we got the output. And the
output in this case, as you can see, is
just a block of text.
It's a block of text that looks like
this, which has all the weaknesses, all
the strength and so on. So, something
like this we can add into a database in
notion, right? right or anywhere in
Google Sheets, whatever it is that you
use in a very structured format with
each column. And so what we do is then
we add this here, right? We are able to
then um make sure the information is in
different variables. The next step once
we have this once you have the whole
rating, weaknesses, strength, XYZ or we
go to the next step which is sending an
email. So we send a confirmation email.
Uh this is a Gmail node. All you have to
do is first connect your account. Sign
in with Google which will take you to
this page. Make sure you have the right
account and then bring it back. It's
very very easy. And then we want to do
message because that is the thing we're
manipulating. Send because that is the
action we're taking to. So who are we
sending the email to? Well, this is
something that we get from here. The
email
subject line. Thank you for application.
And then we want to put the body um the
text, right? And the way that we do that
is through HTML. HTML is just the way
that you make your emails look pretty.
You could also not use HTML. I think it
doesn't really matter. Okay, we're not
adding any links or anything. Um, and
the email is hey, so hey S in this case
because S is a the full name. Let me go
here for a second. Let me manipulate the
uh the full name so you get to see what
an actual full name looks like.
There we go. Save. And here you get to
see that the full name turns into a
first name. And the way that we do that
is using formulas. So the formula here
the way that it works and this might
look complex for someone who has never
seen uh these type of formulas but it
looks like this right and the logic that
I go through when I make formulas is the
following. So we have the full name
which is Mike Torti and a full name
ideally. So Mikuel Torti is separated
into the first name and the last name
and between the first name and the last
name there is a a space. So if we split
this and this by the presence of a space
then we get this we get one then we get
two and now if we want to get the first
one then we just have to use first to
then get the uh the first name. So the
way that this works is that we're saying
okay this is the full name because this
is the variable.
Let's split this by the presence of a
space because this is the space and then
let's get the first one
right and it's actually quite easy once
you actually break it down that way. But
if you look at this at hand side you
think what what the is this? Um but
that's what it means. Say hey Michaela
thanks for applying we received your
application and our team will review it
shortly. We'll get back to you with the
next steps. um as well. We should
probably be able to put this right here,
which by the way, this stands for
[music] break. This is a new line,
right? So, we have new lines here.
That's it. And then we have notion. So,
the way that notion works is that we set
up a workspace so that we have one
database. So, this is the same exact
database, right? This, this, this, and
this. It's just the way that we look at
the database is different. So in here we
have a filter which is like hey the low
applicants are everybody that has a
score less than five. Medium applicants
are the ones that have a score more than
four and less than seven. And then high
ranking applicants have a score more
than six. Right? And that's it. But if I
just took the filter out right here you
could see that I have the applicant
right here. It's just because we have a
filter that we don't see the applicants.
So that we're able to just basically
sort or filter by who are the low
applicants, medium and high ranking as
well. And then we have applications
which shows us the amount of
applications that we get over time.
Right now you could use a Google Sheets
for this. It's not really a crazy amount
of difference. It's just the fact that
we can filter and we can do so much more
in notion than we can on Google Sheets.
So when we set this up, the first thing
you have to do is go in here. You have
to make sure that you can create a new
credential. I recommend that you ask the
AI assistant for what to do here because
it is a bit of a longer process, but
actually takes 2 minutes. Um, and get
the internal um, integration secret. By
the way, the alternative of this is
Google Sheets, so you can use either and
it walks you through everything. Um,
yeah. And then once you have that, make
a database that has these columns right
here. Applicant name, first and last
name, email, phone number, application
date, resume, strength, weakness, risk
factor, reward factor, overall fit, and
justification. And these are the fields.
So in this case we have a title which is
the name, first name which is the first
name, last name, last name, email,
email, phone and so on. And now we
actually forgot to put the date. So we
can put the date as now. And the way
that that works is it's asking me for a
date. And I know that the the date in
any is curly brackets because it's
inside a variable, right? So we have a
variable here just like this. Inside we
have to do a dollar sign now. And this
is the output that we get. Now, ideally,
we don't want it in this output because
we still have words. So, we put a format
like this. So, we format it in this way,
which will then be good to then send it
to notion. And then we have the resume,
uh, strength and weaknesses, and risk
factor, reward factor, overall fit, and
justification. So, these are all the
fields that will go into notion to then
rate the applicant. And that's how we
get everything to here, right?
Applications, uh, high ranking, low
ranking, and so on. All right, let's
start from zero and I'll take you
through exactly like the the data and so
on which I did before but now we go into
detail. I want to execute the workflow.
I'm going to call this let's say James
low
my email still phone number
then my CV it's not really my CV it's
one of my friends. So if you're looking
at this man we'll break it out to
everyone. Uh press submit and then this
now goes to the to the Google Drive
folder then downloads a file. It
extracts the text. Right? Right. So we
have the text. It extracts this uh PDF
text right right here. It then uses AI
then think through its output right
here. And now it give me an error. So
what was the error? Send email
confirmation. Unable to sign in. Oh,
okay. Cuz I put the wrong account. There
we go. Yeah, I think this works. If I
execute step. Yeah, send. And then
lastly, we have notion, right? Which
adds the applicant James Low should be
able to add it to the high ranking James
Low. There you go. with everything, even
the date right here. As you can see,
it's different from this one because we
forgot to add it there. We have the
resume link right here. And then we have
the strength, weakness, risk factor,
reward factor, overall fit, and
justification. That's it. Now, something
like this could be very, very beneficial
for any kind of business that is hiring
new applicants. And there's so much more
that you can do with hiring because
stuff like these takes 10, 15 minutes or
even 5 minutes for someone to match a CV
to someone else or to another um
qualification. And if they have hundreds
of applicants and that's hundreds of
hours and they have to spend to actually
doing this tedious tasks that AI could
literally do in seconds and teams
literally spend tens of thousands of
dollars for people or team members to be
able to do those tasks which is insane
cuz now AI can actually do them for you.
Hey, in this video I'm going to build an
email classifier AI agent inside of NIDN
that watches for your emails coming
through. It then classifies them based
on different criterias. It then uses a
series of AI agents that will now write
back an email which will then be drafted
into our inbox. All right, so this right
here is the email classifier system. All
I have to do is send myself an email.
I'm going to go here. So I said, "Hey,
question about company. Hey Miklly, I
have a quick question. What do you guys
do and what is your service?" I'm going
to press send. This should now come to
this inbox. As you can see, we just got
the email question about company. All I
have to do here, I'm going to test this.
I'm going to press X workflow. This will
now get the email that it used. It
classified it as a customer support
email. It will now generate a draft
email that we can find here. If I go to
support, I can see that this email right
here, question about company, it's here.
And we generated a draft email to that
question that we can now double check
before sending it to the customer who
wrote us the email. And this is the
exact same concept when it comes to high
priority, promotion, and finance and
billing. Right here, we have promotion,
priority, and finance and billing. All
right. So, let's build the whole system
step by step. As I always say, we
shouldn't build it first. we should map
it out first to then have a strategy or
an action plan when we build it cuz it
makes it so much easier for us. I'm
going to go here and for every
automation that we do, we have an input
and we have an output, right? So in this
case, the input would be the email
coming through. So watch emails. Then we
want to classify the email, right? Cuz
we want to have that first before
labeling it and before writing a draft
email that will then be drafted into our
inbox, right? So we have this stuff
right here. We have uh label email
or was it classify email? Yeah, classify
email. And we can classify it based on
support. We had what was it? Priority.
We then had urgent. No, that was urgent.
Was it urgency? Promotion, finance and
billing and priority. Yeah. Promotion,
finance and billing. Right. So we are
taking the new emails that come through
from our inbox. We're then sending it to
an AI to classify emails based on
whether they are support, priority,
promotion, and finance and billing. Then
what we're doing at that point is we are
sending it. Let me put it here. We're
sending it to the appropriate AI agent
to AI agent
to correct AI agent. No, actually no, we
should label the email first, right?
label the email and then we
use AI agent to
draft email reply
and then we actually draft a reply
to inbox.
So that's I think that's the I think
that's what we want to do. Keep it
simple, right? We're getting an email.
We're classifying it. Then we're sending
it to the appropriate AI agent to do its
own thing to label it first. Or you can
do the you can do the inverse as well.
You can generate a reply and then label
it. But I like
um it'd be easier to just label it first
and then draft it. And then we actually
draft a reply to the inbox. I do think
though that when the email is urgent, we
shouldn't draft a reply to the inbox. We
should send message to team on Telegram.
Okay, because the fact that they're
urgent makes it so that we have to
notify our team to do its thing to
actually go there and and and check it
and send it through um or reply
themselves, right? In that case. All
right, so we're going to use this when
we actually build the system. So, let me
go to a new workflow. All right, I have
a new workflow right here. I can put
email classifier AI agent. And now the
way that we start is with the first
step. So, the first step is watching
your emails. So, I go here and I go to
Gmail because that is a provider. If
you're using Outlook, I believe that you
can do it. Outlook or message received.
Yeah. So, you can do it. Um, but we're
using Gmails because we're Google folks.
And then the first step of the
automation is a trigger. So, the trigger
is what is a thing that starts
automation? Like how do how do we start
it? Well, in this case, we only have one
trigger, which is a message received,
which is basically saying, hey, when we
receive a message, in this case, a
message is an email, then we start the
automation. And the first thing we have
to do is connect our account to Naden.
All you have to do is create a new
credential. You can press sign in with
Google. This will take you to this page
right here. Choose an account and then
bring it back. I already have it
connected which will be JM solutions
email.
And now we are given different options.
So we're given poll times which means do
you want to check it every minute? Do
you want to check it every hour, every
day, every week, every month, every X?
Custom. In this case, we can just do
we can just leave it leave it blank. And
the event itself will be message
received, right? Because that is the
action that we're doing. We're receiving
a message and then we're starting the
automation. Simplify just means you want
to simplify the data that we get
through. And I'll show you exactly what
what that looks like. And
that's it. So, we're going to need to
test this by sending ourselves an email
to the inbox of the email that you
connected the Gmail with. So, I'm going
to go here and send myself an email.
Customer uh support question.
Hey, what's your return policy?
I'm going to press send. I'm going to go
to my inbox. All right. So, we have the
email here. Customer support question.
And now I can press execute workflow.
So, this is now testing the the actual
automation because when we build
automations, uh even AI agents, I mean
everything in general with N, we want to
be able to test every single time. So we
have this here. This is the data that we
got. Hey, what's your return policy? I
believe this is because we put an
apostrophe and this is how it um
classifies it. I'm going to pin this so
that when I go to the next steps, I
don't have to rerun the automation every
single time. All right. Now, once this
is done, I can go to the next step. So
this is green to classify the email
based on whether it's support, priority,
promotion, and finance and billing. I'm
going to go here, press plus. I'm going
to go classify text classifier right
here is actually a pretty good feature.
I'm not going to lie. Um because we are
as in the system is set up so that we
give a text which is the snippet which
is the actual email [music] and then
what we do is we start adding
categories. So categories would be maybe
support and you put a description of
what a support email is. So this is for
support emails asking just general
questions. Then category you can do
priority
can do email required attention action
typically from key stakeholders clients
ASAP immediate deadlines all that stuff.
Then we have the next one which is uh
promotions we go here promotions and
then this will be emails related to
marketing campaigns and so on. The
description emails related to finance
matters such as invoices, billing
statements, payment reminders uh or
expense reports anything involved
transactions and so on. Okay. So again
we have the support which is this and
I'm going to paste the one that I had
before because it is more sophisticated.
So emails related to ongoing
communication with current clients or
including stakeholders including service
requests feedback support tickets and
inquiries keyword requests in so we give
it a few examples of also keywords. Same
thing with priority
promotions and we have financing and one
thing we also have is the system prompt
template. We will leave it like this. I
think it's pretty good. Please classify
the text provided by the user into one
of the following categories. Categories
which is the ones up here and use the
provided formatting instructions below.
Don't explain and only output the JSON
which is perfect. So now if I execute
the step
a model sub node must be connected.
Right? I don't know why I'm tripping but
we have to connect the model to this
because it is run by AI. Uh and feel
free to choose anything even open AI is
fine. In order to connect your OpenAI,
make sure to go to platform.openai.com.
You can go to the dashboard, go to API
keys, make a key right here, and then
copy the key and bring it all the way
back to and then connect your account
pressing it. Once this is done, you'll
have your account connected. You can use
4.1 mini. We have different models as
well that we can use. I think 4.1 mini
is great. In my previous video, I spoke
about how you can use open router, which
is the thing that allows us to be able
to choose any model that we want without
having to make a cloud connection, open
connection, everything else. Check it
out here. Um, good video.
But now we use OpenAI. So now we can
execute the step. This should now work.
And we can see that these are all the
branches that we have. Support,
priority, promotions, finance, and
billing. and it went down the support
branch
because the question was hey what's the
return policy? So that is a support
question. So as you can see here we have
different options right cuz we put
different categories and each category
represents a path that the automation
can go through right priority promotions
finance and billing. So what we're going
to do now is we're going to go to the
next steps which is
not this this is green labeling the
emails right and so if I go to here I
can then add the node which is Gmail I
believe this is add label to message
same connection the resource which is
what is the thing that we're actually
manipulating it will be message the
action that we're taking is operation
the message ID it's something that you
can actually get down here so this will
be uh
ID
and if that's not the right one then
we'll change it later but I believe this
yeah this is ID and then the label names
or IDs you can choose from your inbox
right here right now as you can see here
I already have the different labels so
if you don't see them here it's because
you didn't add them here so if I add
let's say test right if I press create
now I have test if I go here I should be
able to see test. Let me refresh.
Actually, it doesn't show immediately.
There you go. Test. Right. So, it's only
because you don't have them here that it
doesn't show up on NN. So, make sure to
add your labels to your emails uh to
then be able to see them in your
automation so you can add them to the
inbox.
Cool. So, now this will be the first
category which I believe is support.
So, support.
There we go. You can do label equal
support.
What we're going to do now is we're
going to hover over this and we're going
to copy and paste.
This will be priority. High priority.
Yeah, priority right here. Change the
name to
priority.
Same thing with here promotions and then
finance and billing. You could you could
put a Gmail label thing every single
time, but just to save yourself those
[snorts] few minutes, you can just copy
and paste. Here will be promotions. So,
this will be promotions
and this will be
promotions
and down here will be finance and
billing. Finance and billing.
And down here you can put finance and
billing. So now in theory when it
classifies it, it should classify it and
actually label the email on our inbox.
So if I pin this,
I should actually no, never mind. Let me
not pin this. Let me just run this
execute workflow. This should now
classify as support and this should be
labeled as support. So if I go here, the
email that we received, customer support
question, this is now labeled as
support. As you can see, it just
changed. So which is good. And now that
we know that this works, we can go to
the next step which is um using AI to
draft an email reply.
So in order for us to draft a reply, we
can use the AI agent because the thing
is we can also connect it to the tool
which is draft an email, right? So it
does two in one. It drops a reply and
also draft it in our inbox. So the first
thing I have to do is
create a chat model, right? And connect
it to our chat model. One hack that we
typically do with AI agents, especially
when you have five or six is you connect
them all to the same tool. You could
just duplicate it here. You can just go
delete and then choose Open AI.
But for it to look less tools and less
stuff on the screen, you can just drag
it across here. So now this is connected
to the chat model. Then we're going to
go inside here. We're going to name this
uh customer support agent.
The user message will not be chat to
node because we're not chatting to it in
this case. We are just defining it
below. And now here I should add the
text for the email. Okay. I think we're
missing something. I think we are
because if I go here I don't actually
see the text. I see the snippet but the
snippet is basically the the cut version
of the email. So if the email is longer
then it will cut it. It will give us a
snippet of it. So all we have to do I
think is simplify. Yeah. I'm going to
run this again.
Uh, I'm going to send myself an email.
What's your policy for returns and what
do you guys do as a company? I'm going
to press send. As you can see, we have
the email right here. Uh, customer
support. And now, if I go here to end it
in, I can fetch test event. Okay, there
we go. So, when I added simplify, it
didn't show me all these things, but we
want the text. Like, we want the actual
text. Perfect. Let me pin this. If I go
here to the AI agent, I can give it the
uh email text.
and email from.
Or maybe I do the opposite. Yeah, I do
the opposite. Uh, email from and email
text.
Gmail trigger the email from.
Let's see if I can just go here
from there. We go from and then the
email text
will be this,
right? And this is what we give the AI
as a user message because there's two
types of messages or prompts in this
case. There is a user and there's a
system. The user in this case is like
what is the thing that we're giving it
every single time as in variables that
change. Then we have a system message
which is simply the instructions, right?
So we give it the information on user.
We then give it the instructions on
system so that it uses the instructions
with the the variables that we give it
every single time to do the task. And so
right here I'm going to paste the prompt
that I have made before
and go here expression go big and then
paste it. And
so for the system message I'm going to
go full screen. I'm going to say we
typically structure our prompts with an
overview. Then we have tools and then we
have rules. Tools and rules. So overview
would be want to say you're a customer
support representative named Kelly. Your
job is to respond to customer inquiries
in a friendly and professional manner.
Then the tools. So what is it? What tool
are you connecting to this? Well, in
this case, we're connecting the draft
email, right? So if you go here to each
Gmail, we can do draft
message draft
or was it draft? Yeah, draft here.
Create the draft. The subject line, I'm
going to let it do its thing. Like this
basically means let AI define this based
on the context that it was given. Then
the message as well.
let the model define this parameter.
This is great for us because we don't
have to give it a variable every single
time. We can just press this button
which makes it so much easier for us to
draft emails and reply things back uh
because of this feature as well. And
then we're also doing the email to email
two. And the email to will be the email
that we get the email from which will be
this right here.
And also in addition to that we want the
thread ID. Now the thread ID makes it so
that when we go to let's say support
here. Yeah. You see how it replied on
the thread. So the thread just means in
the same conversation because the
opposite of that could be that we have
this just as a reply as a draft on a
separate email but it's not in the same
thread. So this allows us to be able to
have the same conversation. It's sort of
like a chat ID on on Telegram. Um it's
the same. So we can say uh thread ID and
we can find a thread ID.
Where can we find it? There we go.
Thread ID. This will be the tool that we
use that we connect all the tools to cuz
again just like we can connect the child
model to the same tool. We can also
create a draft and email tool and we can
connect that to all the AI agents who
make the emails. So in this case we have
customer support agent with a small G. I
don't know why it's pissing me off. Um
and then we have this is it. So I'm
going to test this. I'm going to go
execute workflow
text to classify. Oh, okay. Okay,
gotcha. Because we also have to change
this. So if I go here text and then
replace this
again. Make sure this is not simplify
because simplify gives you less
variables. Um I want to press execute
workflow again. This will not classifies
it. It will label it as support and then
it will use the AI agent to reply an
email or to make a reply. I'll put
subject line. Now, the one thing that I
don't know why it didn't do is it didn't
call the tool. I know why. Because we
didn't tell what tool it needs to call.
So, I'm going to rename this draft
email. I'm going to go inside. I'm going
to go in the prompt and I'm going to say
draft email. Use this to send an email
reply to a customer. Always sign off as
James from ABC Corp. And the rules is
keep the emails
concise.
That's it. Keep the email concise. Um
I'm going to execute the workflow again
so you get to see how it now calls the
tool. It's all prompting, right? Like AI
agents are all prompting because if it
wasn't for the prompt, it wouldn't have
called this tool. The text right here, I
believe. Yeah. Return policy. What's
return policy? And this is the answer
that it gives. A return policy allows
customer to do XYZ. All right. Now that
we have this, we can now replicate this
for pretty much all the other agents.
I'm going to copy this. Going to paste
this. Going to paste this here.
Going to paste this here.
The only thing we have to do is that for
label priority. Let me actually see if I
can change the order. Let me change the
order here because
I want priority to be first cuz priority
goes to a different way. Let me go here
and put a space. Paste this. then go
back here and then this be the thing
here. So I just switched it because I
want
priority to go to goes first and then
support to go second. All right, cool.
Now that we have this, we are able to
then rename the agents. So the chat
model here will be connected to here.
This will be connected to here. It looks
a bit messy because we need to space it
out. So let me space this out a little
bit. Let me go here. Chat model will go
here. And now I'm going to add this
here. Put this down here. It's also
important for you when you build
automations for it to actually look
clean or structured. Um, so it makes the
I guess visual when you're debugging it
and so on a lot better. Um, and so now
we have customer support. We can do
promotional
promotion agent.
We can do finance agent.
Let's hook this up to the same tool,
right? Because the only difference
really is is the label, right? And then
we make a reply, but and we do have to
change part of the prompt, right? So, we
have to go inside finance and say you
are a finance support representative
named Kelly
to customer increase to finance
increase. This will be promotional. So,
you are a promotion no support
representative to promotional queries.
That's it. And then this one will be
priority and the message will be
different. So I'm going to paste this.
You're an agent in charge of high
priority emails. Your job is to
summarize incoming emails and escalate
them to the human. And the tool will
change, right? So we're not using the
draft email anymore. We're using
Telegram. So in this case tool, we can
search for Telegram. Telegram tool. And
in order to connect to Telegram here,
just follow the step-by-step guide. For
the sake of time, I'm not going to be
able to show you step by step how to do
it. But if you follow these
instructions, it'll be good. And now
you'll have this. So the message is the
thing that we're manipulating. The the
operation will be send the message. The
chat ID, I don't think we need it,
right? To be honest. Yeah, we don't need
it. And the text itself will be
defined by the model. I mean, we do need
it, right? But we can define this. We
can we can let this be defined or not,
right? If I'm wrong, I'll we'll fix it.
But there we go. Reply markup none.
Okay. So,
Telegram.
And what I'm going to say here is you're
an agent in charge of hyperarities. And
the tool you're going to use is
Telegram. Use this email to send the
summary of the email once it's
summarized.
Look at that. English. Use this email to
send the summary of the email once it's
summarized. That's fine. And now what we
can do is test it. to test this right
here. I'm going to go here. I'm going to
press this little pencil right here,
which basically manipulates the data.
I can go.
Okay, [laughter] I think we're cooked
here. Received. Where's the text? Text.
There we go.
Want to take this out and say, "Hey,
there we have a client emergency. We She
wants to know or they want to know how
much we charge
urgent. Well, actually, let's not put
this cuz that's clearly obvious that
it's urgent, right? I'm going to press
save. And now, if I execute workflow,
this should send Telegram message, but
it didn't because the chat ID, I
believe, was wrong. Chat not found.
Okay. So, what we have to do here is
this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Okay. Cool. Cool. Yeah, cuz the chat ID
here isn't is a number. It's not it's
not text. So, it doesn't it doesn't
categorize it as that.
Yeah. So, the problem here was that the
chat ID
it gave it as urgent emails, but the
chat ID is numbers. So, that's wrong.
So, what we have to do is we have to use
Telegram. Go here Telegram
and follow me through here. There's a
clear thought process to why we're doing
it. Uh we're going to
um actually let me go back add another
trigger telegram
on message
received on message un message. Yeah on
message I can now go to telegram I mean
we can see that the worked right like
the email was sent. Um what I'm going to
do though is I'm going to execute step.
So this is now watching for yeah
watching for messages. I want to say
hello.
Okay, with this here I can now get the
chat ID. Okay, so now if I get the chat
ID, I can then move this. I can hardcode
it right here.
So the chat ID can be the same, right?
Because it can be in the same exact chat
that we have. Um, so let's try this
again. Let me go to execute workflow.
And here we should see an email coming
through at any time. So hybrid email
from authority a client emergency
requires XYZ. And we can remove this. So
we can remove this message was sent
automatically with Nitn. I believe it's
here. Add fields
append edit and attribution. We can turn
this off.
Okay. So we got to see the message was
sent successfully. [sighs] And now let's
try with let's say finance, right? So
let's say we send ourselves an email.
Say hey there. Can you provide us with
the billing statement? Um James want to
press send. All right. So we got the
email billing statement. I can press
execute workflow.
They should now send it down here.
Finance and billing. It should label it.
It should make a reply a draft. And then
I should see it right here. Finance and
billing. Finance and billing. Right
here. I can see that we have uh
information. Now, one thing that you
should be asking yourself here because
if you're not asking yourself this, then
I don't know. Uh this is obviously
hallucinating, right? Like let's be
honest, like how how this can't be
accurate because we're simply using AI
which is not trained on any data. And so
to mitigate this, what we would have to
do is you can add a step right here
where we can basically pull in
information from a superbase. So you can
have superbase back to the store which
is trained on all our company's data
and then we can then pull the
information and then draft the reply cuz
then we have context like the the actual
agent doesn't just hallucinate because
obviously this right here we'll prepare
a billing statement and send it to you
shortly. This is obviously not true and
so this just makes it up and so in real
life in actual business you can't have
something like this specifically you
would need an extra step here of pulling
information from a vector database which
is a basically like a Google sheet
that's better which you pull information
from before sending it to the client
before actually replying to the client
because it actually is accurate right at
that point. So that right there is a
full email classifier AI agent built
inside of N8N.
In today's video, I'm going to show you
step by step how I built a full AI
powered blog generation system inside of
Naden that can write highly effective
wellressearched blogs by a team of AI
agents. All right, so this right here is
the system. I'm going to run it from
scratch and show you exactly how it
works before we uh go step by step and
show you how I built it. I'm going to
press execute workflow. I'm going to put
the post topic. Let's do AI in finance
and let's do investment bankers.
So the post topic for the blog is am
finance. Then we do investment bankers.
Let me just finance. There you go. And
ton of voice will be direct.
So these are the three different inputs
that we give it. We press submit. What
this will now do is it will send the
information to the first AI agent which
is a new letter expert which basically
does research on the topic that we're
doing. Then what we do is we generate an
outline using an AI step which will then
be split into four different parts
because the outline has four different
parts of uh of the blog. We'll have a
research agent which is this one right
here which will do more research on the
actual topic that is written on that
first paragraph or first section of the
blog uh and second and third and fourth
as well. Then what we do here is using
the outline which is split up into four
different parts. We send it to the
research agent which is this one right
here which is now doing research on each
part of the blog using perplexity and
it's actually writing the snippet for
that specific part. Then what we do here
is we merge the output from here and
here as well. We aggregate them which
means we put them all into one place
before sending it to the editor AI agent
which in this case is an AI agent that
will edit the actual newsletter. So
that's that's going to be the final
version and we use cloud here because
claude is a better model to write
content. Then we use just an AI step to
generate a title and then we send the
[music] actual newsletter to our inbox.
If I go to my inbox and on my inbox I
can see that I have generative AI
transforming investment bank operations
and this is the full blog that we use.
And a good thing about this is that it
uses it actually references which
sources. If you go here to two, it
references the source that we're using,
right? Also, you can see down here
first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and
sixth. And this right here is just a
prompting thing. Um, and now you have a
fully optimized blog which gives us
highly in-depth research from the top
sources, from top credible sources that
we can use. And a good thing about this
is you can have this running daily cuz
right now we have a form, but you can
replace this with a Google sheet that
will have different topics and then a
ontime schedule, which means that it
will run every week, every day, and so
on. And you'll have a fully optimized
blog in your inbox. So with that said,
let's see exactly how this works and
let's go step by step. All right, so
let's go through the first step which is
the form input. So we added a form.
Again, this can be any kind of input,
right? The form is just the easiest
because we can just simply execute step
and we can have access to this form
right here, which is a very very simple
form that we just create natively within
NN. And for the forms itself on NN, we
have the test URL and we have the
production URL. Now bear in mind the
test URL is just the URL that you use
when you're testing. Okay, hence the
name test URL. when you're going to
production, which means that you are
turning this on, you're activating this,
that's when you use the production URL.
So, in theory, what this would look like
is you wouldn't have to go inside here
and press execute step and run the whole
thing. You would just activate it. You
would use a production URL, and that's
the thing that you paste into your
browser when you're doing whatever
you're doing, right? As you can see
here, this is not activated. So, this is
deactivated. Um, so we can't see it.
Then, we have authentication right here.
here and authentication can be used to
basically add a password between the
person that wants to fill out the form
and actually filling out the form
because if you don't want anybody or if
you don't want everybody to have access
to the form then you want a password.
Well, in this case we can just leave it
blank um cuz this URL is pretty unique.
Then we have the form title in this case
newsletter form and then these are the
fields. So the fields is what are we
asking the user to fill out? In this
case, we are asking the post topic which
is in text field and a placeholder can
be VI and finance. Placeholder just
means this, right? So if you execute a
step, this is a placeholder which means
what is a thing that they see and
typically you add this as inspiration
for what they could add. Right? [music]
Let's make this a required field
actually. Target audience text required
field and then tone of voice drop down.
So we have three different choices. So
we have authorative uh tone, humorous
and direct. These are the three
different choices. So this will be the
input again when we press execute
workflow. This will execute the actual
workflow. So I can do AI in computer
science target audience 50year-old men
tone of voice can be authoritative. And
then we see here that this is the answer
that we get. Okay. And this is the
variables that we then pull into the
next step. Now I'm going to pin this so
I don't have to rerun it again every
single time. The next step we're doing
is we're setting variables. Now honestly
you don't have to do this. I don't know
why I did this to be honest. Um, you can
go without this, but I just wanted to
set the variable topic, target audience,
and tone of voice for no reason
actually. So, we can actually delete
this. Uh, but because this is connected
to all these, then it makes sense to
have this. I typically have this just to
have things organized. Um, and basically
what this looks like is we're
replicating this these variables to just
have topic, target audience, and tone
voice. And typically why you do this is
because on the form submission, we also
get the submitted at form mode, which is
extra variables that I don't want to
see. But at the same time, you can go
without this because I mean these these
fields are only two fields, right?
There's not a crazy amount. Um, but we
usually use set variables when we have
an input, which is a ton of different
variables. I think you use like API or
any of these softwares, they give you
like a 100 variables and then you
basically want to extract the variables
that you actually need and that's where
you use a set variable. In this case, it
didn't make much sense of why I used it,
but you can still use it cuz we don't
get charged by step, we get charged by
execution. Then we have the first AI
agent which is a newsletter expert. We
can use a tools agent. There's three
different types of agents. OpenAI
functions agent which uses OpenAI to
just do its thing. Conversations agent
so you can talk to it. We leave this as
tools agent because we are using tools
with the agent. Uh the source prompt
which is what is the input that we're
getting. In this case, if I execute the
previous nodes, I can see that the input
is this. So we give it the prompt user
message because every AI agent has two
different types of prompts. Okay, it has
a user prompt and it has a system prompt
also assistant but the main ones are
user and system and the user prompt in
this case would be what is the variables
that we're feeding into the actual AI
agents operates to do its thing and a
prompt user message here is what are the
variables like newsletter topic tone of
voice and target audience which we're
pulling in from here that it uses to
actually do its thing right so that's
for the user message and then we have
the system message now the system
message is a prompt that gives it the
instructions, right? The instructions
for the thing. It doesn't actually give
it the variables because the variables
go in the user message, but we give it
the overview, the context, the
instructions, the tools that it uses,
um, examples as well, input, output,
input, output. So, these are assistant
prompts because we're giving it an
example here, example here, example
here, example here to make it, I guess,
to give it more context as to what we
want to do. Uh because sometimes AI it's
so creative sometimes that it just spits
out what it wants to spit out. So if you
give it a few example, it sort of like
guides it. It narrows down the the focus
that it needs to have when making the
blog for you. Um and so this is the full
prompt and again at the end of the video
I'll show you exactly how you can get
the whole system for free. So don't
worry. Uh but you can also take a
screenshot of this and drop it into
chatbt and ask it to extract text. Uh
that's what I used to do all the time.
And now you have the system message
right here and you have the user
message. And we can see we ran this
before and this is the output that we
get. Of course, this is cut. But if I go
to JSON, I can see here that this is a
full thing. So table of contents. So we
are generating table of contents for the
newsletter, right? And we're using
perplexity as a tool to do so. Why is
because you want to do more research on
the actual topic to then give it proper
table of contents. And table of contents
is like okay, what's going to be in the
actual newsletter? What's going to be in
the blog? Once we have this, let me pin
this. Then we go ahead in the next step
which is generate an outline. And here
we're not using an AI agent. We're just
using a simple step. Now to connect your
OpenAI to NDN, all you have to do is
press create a new credential. You can
go to platform the openi
platform.openai.com.
You can go to login, choose your
account,
and then you want to go to dashboard.
Get your API key right here. Press this
button. Get a key. you can copy and
paste back right [music] here. Bear in
mind this is not free as in you still
have to pay for this. Um and you pay for
this using something called an API
credit. Now the API credit is something
that you can see where is it billing the
left hand side and you will add money
here. It is very very cheap. So it will
only cost a tenth of a cent when you run
this. Um so but make sure you have about
$5 cuz that is the recommended amount
that we use. All right. Now that we have
this, we have connected our OpenAI to
end. We can use text because that is a
thing that we're manipulating. The
action that we're taking is messaging a
model, which means that it's sort of
like we're going to chat GBT and we're
typing something to get an answer back.
Then we're using the model 40 mini
because it is the um we're going for
like speed and quality, right? And a 40
mini is great. And the prompt is this.
Your job is to split out the table of
contents into an individual item for
each section. I'll put each section
separately in a field called newsletter
sections. When doing so, keep in mind
that the newsletter target audience is
this and the tone of the newsletter is
this. So now we're pulling in the
variables from here separables. Here's a
table of contents. So what we're asking
it to do is this. We're asking it to
basically get the table of contents
which is a block of text and then output
an array. Right? An array I'll show you
exactly what it is. An array is a
something right where it contains
different items inside that something.
So in this case it contains the four
different sections. Uh each section has
a title and has a description. Title and
description. Title and description. Why
do we do this? Well you can simply and
by the way this whole system you can
simply replace by just using one prompt
from TGBT to make a blog. But because
you want to make it higher quality,
right? And go through basically
generating an outline and taking each
bucket of that outline. What I mean by
this is taking each newsletter section
and then giving it to AI to do research
and then making it more optimized and
then making it better, right? And so
what we're doing here is we're asking it
to take this text which is unstructured
because it's a block of text which
doesn't make much sense to us and we
can't really do anything with it and
then giving it to AI and saying hey take
this block of text that we have here. So
this is the input and basically split it
out. So I want you to split out an array
which is something that has different
items in it. And you know it's an array
because typically has a square bracket.
Square bracket. Yeah. Square bracket
here and here. And inside the square
bracket there are a bunch of items which
is this and here. And then this and here
and this here as well. And same thing
with this, right? And so these items are
all pretty much the same. And those are
the four items which means that there
are four table of contents, four
different parts of the blog that we want
to iterate. We want to split out right
each one and then use each one for
research. Use each one to write the blog
and use each one to make the blog
better. So once we have this then we can
spit out right. So I mentioned that we
let me pin this. If I press this
you can see this is now four items. Why
is because the array itself is best for
us to use when we want to get the array
which can be found here. So if I go here
new set section this now will split up
four different items first, second,
third and fourth and that's exactly what
we then feed into our AI agent which is
a research agent right here to do more
research. So the input of course is a
tools agent because you're using tools.
Uh the source prompt is user message
which we'll define below. And then the
user message itself which is what are
the variables that are going into the AI
agent for it to use to do its thing are
the section title which is this section
description which will be this right
here. Where is it? Generate outline.
There we go. Description
newsletter target audience
which should be this right here. The
target audience. There we go. And
newsletter tone of voice. And so we feed
all of this in so that it has context as
to what the actual section is, right?
And so this being the user message and
this is a prompt that we use for the
research agent. And so we have an
overview which is you are an AI agent
responsible for delivering only the
final content for a newsletter. Then we
have context uh which is all necessary
details including the section title, the
description, the target audience and the
tone will be provided. then the goal and
the content must be supported by
research and then we give it
instructions and this is usually how the
the actual prompt goes right we have
overview context instructions now in
this case we have tools it's only one
tool because we're connecting this to
perplexity to do the research and with
that said we have citations examples so
we give it examples and SOPs as well and
this is a very very good prompt as in it
has markdown formatting which is the
hashtags which is basically saying hey
this heading one, this is heading two
and so on. And then it has a bunch of
stuff as well. So rules, guidelines, all
that stuff that he needs. And [music]
from here we start using claude
comparison to OpenAI right here because
claude because now we're actually
writing content, right? And Claude is
the best at content. And to connect your
cla account, press create a new
credential anthropic console. And then
you can go to get an API key. You can go
to create an API key. Just name it
whatever you want. You get a key that
you can then paste back here. Now 3.5
set is one of the best for content. Let
me actually search it up. Um, which
cloud model is best for content?
I believe it's 3.5 sonnet. I think so.
Not cloud cloud. Let's see. Cloud.
Showing you guys the full raw content.
Uh, because that's what it is. Claus
Opus 4. Okay.
Cloud Opus 4. Do we have that available
to us? I don't think we do.
Yeah, we don't have an API version. So,
let's do API model
because not all models are given to us
for an API. Um, Cloud 4 generation, Opus
4 and Son of 4 are hybrid models. Opus 4
is the most scalable. Yeah, son of 4.
Son of 4 um is designed for speed plus
quality as well. And since we don't have
four here, we're just going to use 3.5.
And that's the thing that it uses as its
brain because again an AI agent usually
has a brain which in this case is LLM
and then it has tools that is connected
to which are in this case perplexity the
thing that it actually uses to take
action. And if you want to build your
first AI agent from scratch check out
this video up here. Once we do here is
we run this what this will now do is it
will go through each section one by one.
So four different items at the same
time. Not at the same time obviously
separately. And it does research on each
one. And the reason why we're adding two
different inputs is because the first
input is the actual research that it
does. And the second input is the
description. All right. So now we
finished the actual research. And bear
in mind that each section of the blog
will be researched, right? And that's
what this does. So I'm going to pin this
so we don't [music] have to rerun it
again cuz it does take a while.
Obviously got cut in the video, but I've
been here for about 4 minutes waiting.
Um [music] and now with the merge node
what we do here is let me press execute
step. This will now get the output of
the research agent but it will also get
the title
and the description. So the merge node
is usually combining right two inputs
because you have one and two and we're
putting them all together. So you see
how it went from here, here, and here to
all three right here. And these are four
different items, which means that it
does it for every single section of the
block. All right. Now that we have this,
we can then aggregate it because we
don't want to send four items
individually to the editor AI agent. We
want to send all together, right?
Because we have four items. Let's put
them all together. And as you can see by
the diagram here, this node right here
is to take all the different separate
items and put them all together into one
paragraph. So let me go here execute
step and here we get all the titles and
we get all the outputs because again
four items for the four outputs in this
case for the research agent and that's
why we put individual fields the input
field name will be title because it's
title. Same thing with output which is
this one right here and that's what it
takes to merge the list. Again merge
list just means merge everything
together like this. So, we're able to
then feed it into the editor AI agent
which will be the thing to actually
write the blog, right? To actually put
everything together. Um, it will be a
tools agent. The prompt will be the list
of titles and the list of article
content which we get from here and here.
So, we're giving it, let me show you
this. We give it this a full user input.
So, it's going to be a big prompt plus
we give it a system message as well. So,
the system message will have an
overview. So, you're an expert editor
specializing in creating and planning
content to output a high quality
formatted article. You're given a list
of titles and outputs and you will use
these to create a newsletter tailored
towards the defined target audience.
Create a section in the article for each
title with a hyperlink source in each
section based on the content. So, when I
was making this workflow or this AI
agent, I thought of the fact that
obviously you want to have insight,
what's it called? Hyperlink um yeah,
hyperlink um citations. So for example,
when you go into the actual word and
then when you press that word, it goes
directly to the source of that news. And
that's exactly what this is. This is a
fancy way, a HTML way of saying, hey,
this is the URL that we're giving. And
this is the name of the actual thing
that when we press this, it takes us
here. And so that's what it is. And we
have the objective as well to create
content. Uh we have the citation
management. We have the source section.
We have the output format. We have a ton
of stuff in this prompt right here. And
then we want to output a thousandword
maximum or else the automation breaks
right because there's a limit. Uh and
today's date is this. Why do we give it
to today's date is because sometimes
within the actual blog it needs to sort
of site um it says tomorrow, right? Like
how does it know what today is? AI is
not the best at this. So that's why we
give it the actual date. So now with
this prompt right here, I can press
execute step. This will now give all of
this and these uh this prompt right here
to be able to give us a final optimized
sort of blog that we can use to send
ourselves an email. All right. So, we
have the output right here. You see here
with all these lines and and P's and A's
and H2. This is called HTML. HTML is
basically the way that we make our text
look pretty. You know, when you see
emails, when you get emails with
headings, you get with colors and
beautiful things. That's all HTML,
right? And so we want to do that because
of the fact that we want headings, we
want a text [music] when you press on
it, hyperl, right? You press on it, it
goes to the source, all that stuff to
make it look pretty and to make it look
more formatted. We use HTML. And then we
use another AI right here, which is an A
step. Again, same connection. Message a
model for mini, which is fine. And the
prompt is create a title for the
incoming newsletter. The tone of the
newsletter is authoritative. The target
audience is 50-year-old men. And here's
a newsletter. So, we give it the full
newsletter. And then we say only output
the title in plain uh in plain text, no
quotation marks, and capitalize the
first letter of each word. Example, is
artificial intelligence a friend or foe.
So, basically, this is making the title
for the newsletter, which we can then
feed into the subject line of the email
that we're making. I can press execute
step. This now gives us the actual
content, which is the title of the blog.
quantum computing and AI transforming
the future of technology and that's the
thing that we would use to then be able
let me pin this to send ourselves an
email so in the email section just
connect your email and go here and sign
in with Google connect your account
bring it back and you're all good and
then the thing that we are manipulating
is message the action that we're taking
is we're sending the email that we're
sending it to of course is my personal
email the subject line in this case will
be the title here right will be this
right here content we bring it across
here and this is Now the title that we
use and then the email type because
again Gmail gives us two options whether
you do text whether you use HTML. Well,
[music] in this case, because we wrote
the email in HTML, then we get this,
right? We get a full thing, which is the
thing that you saw in my email. And then
we want to turn the append attribution
off, which just means that usually when
you send yourself an email, at the end,
it will say NN send this or sent by NN,
right? We want to take that off. And as
well, we want the name of the actual
person to be daily newsletter, which is
why we add here sender name daily
newsletter. All right, we can just test
this execute step. What this will now do
is it will send us another email. I go
here and refresh quantum computing and
AI. And this is a newly written email
with hyperlink text that I can go here
and I can go to the actual source of the
research which is amazing.
And it has headings. It has more
research. And the citations are coming
from credible citations, right? Which
are great to have. And at the end we
have sources as well. here. And now this
you can use as a way to keep yourself
updated but also to post it on your you
can say on WordPress or any of the sites
that you make blogs in, right? Because
you have a ton of research, a ton of
value that you can get because this
workflow right here is a series of AI
agents. And the reason why we do a
series of AI agents is because when you
break things down and you actually go in
depth into each topic or each section,
the quality is is just much better. And
so as I mentioned before, you can have a
form which is the input which is the
thing that what do we feed in to the
actual system, but you can also have a
Google sheet that you can run through
every single row and you can then add a
you can say
on the schedule right here at the start
which runs maybe every day right so
every day and then it runs and then it
takes the topic from a Google sheet and
then it runs through the whole system
step by step. Now, within our agency,
we've implemented these sort of systems,
especially with blogs and content into
tons of businesses just because of the
fact that businesses know they need to
make content, yet they don't have the
time. They use AI anyways. So, might as
well automate the whole process and save
them a ton of time and make it actually
valuable and and with actual research
and with good prompting so they can
actually get results. And so these
systems right here are perfect for them
because it allows them to have such an
efficient process to generate this
content that can either be sent to our
email that can either be sent to a
WordPress. WordPress is just the way
that you host your website. You can have
blogs on your website, blogs on
LinkedIn, blogs on whatever platform you
use. Uh that is highly effective, highly
researched, well researched, right? Cuz
if it is well researched and so this
system is great because it saves the
company tons of time into making content
and we know it's good because we have
good prompting. which companies usually
don't.
Hey, in this video I'm going to show you
step by step how you can build your own
research AI agent inside of Naden. And
the best part is that it actually takes
less than 5 minutes to set up. So I'm
going to show you exactly how it works,
how you can set it up, and how you can
use it within your automations. So if
that sounds like something that you want
to learn, let's dive in. All right, so
fundamentally we have an input and we
have an output. This is the same exact
structure as a normal AI agent and the
input could be research XYZ. Then the AI
agent has system prompt or instructions.
System prompt just means what is the
thing that we tell the AI agent to do.
Um and it can be hey research this or if
this happens then call this or do
something else. And [music] the output
would be the actual research. Now
between the input and the output the AI
agent now it's hooked up to open AI
which is basically chat GBT and that's
its brain. That's how it thinks. And
then for its tools, cuz tools are like
the things that the AI agent calls that
it sends the request to when it wants to
get something back. Well, in this case,
we're using perplexity because
perplexity is the research LLM. LLM
stands for large language model. It's
like Chad GBT, Claude, they're all LLMs.
And this right here is specifically done
for research. So I can go to Perplexity
here. I can show you that this uh LLM is
like Chad GBT. It looks like it, but
it's known for research. So I can say
find the latest news on AI.
What this will do is that it will get
sources. It will start getting all the
sources and it's known for because it's
really good at finding research and it
gives you the full breakdown of
everything even giving you all the
sources that it used for that specific
research which is insane cuz it does
research over 20 30 40 research papers
all within seconds to give you an
answer. Something that Chad GBT could do
but isn't meant or prompted to do. And
so that's what we're going to use to
connect to the AI agent in order to do
the research. And again, we're doing it
automatically. So, we're using the API
version just like we're using the API
version for OpenAI. So, we're just
creating an AI agent that is hooked up
to perplexity to do research and then we
get the output. So, if I go to N, I can
go to N workflows. All right. So, I'm
currently in N10. I can go to create a
workflow.
As you can see, we have two options. And
if you want to watch the video of me
building it with AI, check it up here.
But we're going to press add first step.
We can go to agent. Just press agent.
And this is how you add an AI agent in
any. So this is where we start
configuring things. And so we're sending
the chat here. This will then send a
signal to the AI agent. If I go inside,
I can see that the user message, which
is what is the thing that's going inside
the AI agent? It will be the chat input,
which I'll show you exactly what it
looks like. And then after the user
message, we can add an option. We can
have a system message. The system
message is the instructions. This part
right here. And so that's what we add
here. We can say your helpful
intelligent assistant that does
research. I'm going to give it a better
prompt later, but for now we can leave
it this. And now, as we mentioned
before, we have the chat model, which is
what is the brain of this LLM? In this
case, it can be openai, which is the one
right here. And I can connect OpenAI to
my account. The way to do that is to go
to platform to openai.com. I can go to
dashboard. I can go to API keys. And the
API key is sort of like a password that
says to an A. You feel free to use my
API key for my account in OpenAI. In top
right, create a new secret key.
and name it. So it can be end.
You can create a new secret key. Leave
everything as is. No restrictions.
And now you have this key that you can
paste within any 10 and name it. I can
name it Mikuel
15th of October.
I can save it. And now I have my account
connected. Bear in mind that this is not
free. So you have to go to here to
profile to billing
and add money here. $5 is more than
enough because it's only taking on
one/10enth of a cent, right? So, it's
fine. All right. Now that we have this
done, we have this connected, we can
choose 4.1 mini. This is basically the
brain again, how it actually thinks. And
now we can connect it to a tool. Now, we
also have a memory here. And the memory
is usually used when we are using the AI
agent sort of like a chatbot like this.
We want it to remember the previous
conversation or the previous answer or
question that we gave it as context for
the next steps. Well, in this case, uh
we can add it. So we go here I can put
simple memory and we have context window
length which is how many past
interactions does the model receive as
context. You can leave five that's fine.
And now for the fun part is perplexity.
So this is how we actually do the
research. So I can go to perplexity. You
can go to perplexity tool right here
which is talking to the API of
perplexity and generating um responses
with citations. I [music] can go in here
and we get introduced to this. Now you
will not get introduced to this because
you will not have an account. All you
have to do is press create a new
credential. And now you need an API key.
So all you have to do is go to
Perplexity.AI
up here and you want to make an account.
Once you make an account, you can go
down to account. You can go to API
and I believe that you have API keys on
the left hand side. Right here you can
accept terms and generate a key. I can
do nitan research agent test. I can
create a key. I can now copy it.
and paste it here. I can say Mikuel
15th of October.
Put it here. There you go. And press
save. And now you should be able to see
it here. And you have successfully
connected any to perplexity. But as we
mentioned before, just like OpenAI, this
is not free. So you have to go to API
billing. So you would have to buy
credits. I think I put $5 on a few
months ago and I still have it. $4.17.
So it's very, very cheap. And once you
have this now you can actually use the
API for tool description we can set
automatically operation which is what is
the action that we're doing is messaging
a model and you can do custom API call
but in this case messaging a model just
says hey I'm going to automatically go
into perplexity I'm going to
automatically type something and get an
answer back and now we have the
different models I'm going to go to
perplexity API models to see the
difference each one there you go models
so here we have all the models and we
have the search models mod which are
inherently the models that you just use
uh to retrieve information just like a
general searching model which is the one
that we're going to use. We have
reasoning so more for multi-step tasks
and research. So this is really for
conducting in-depth research. The only
thing about this is that it does take a
lot longer than uh something like sonar
or sonar pro. So we're just going to use
sonar in this case. I'm going to try
both actually. Um but let's start with
soner and then we can put it there. Can
go inside and now I can change the model
to again soner. We can use sonar pro as
well. And now we have the user prompt.
So the user prompt is what is the thing
that we're giving perplexity. So the
sort of input right that it uses when
it's doing the research. So in this
case, if we press this button right
here, what this will now do is it will
let the model define this parameter. So
the AI agent is smart enough so that it
decides what goes into perplexity for it
to actually do the research for and then
giving us the output. So I'm going to
press this and we can leave everything
as is. All right. Now we have this, I
can test it. So I can go here open chat
and I can say what is the latest news on
why 95% of AI products fail. I can press
go. What this should now do is it will
talk to the uh perplexity tool and it
will talk back to the openi to structure
the output for us to get it back on the
chat. So we can see we have the research
here which is in-depth research. So you
can see it's pretty good research
compared to something like chat GBT. The
key reasons why 95% of a products fail,
poor data quality, lack of business
alignment, execution, cost, privacy,
hype versus hard work. Uh, and then the
5% of a products that succeed typically
is XYZ. So, we get a full report or full
answer researched, right, which is
actually pretty good. This is the thing
that Perplexity is giving us back,
right, which is the responses. We can
see the prompt tokens, uh, the amount
that it took us. So, 0.006, which is
very, very cost effective. And in
citations, so the citations that he
uses, it actually goes to YouTube
videos, which is interesting. Who is
this? Let's see. The AI bubble, why 95%
of AI products fail, 1.1 million. It's
cool. Um, and we have more search
results, right? Which we can then use as
citations or as more evidence as well.
And the content is what is the actual
message back that it gives to the user
with all the citations. You can see 247
obviously refers to um citation 2,
citation 4, citation 7. So that's pretty
much how you can set up an AI agent uh
that can do research. Now I'm going to
apply this to a business use case. So
let's say we had a business which had a
form on the website which you're going
to make and the form on the website
asked someone to add their website,
right? So they say, "Hey, what's your
name? What's your email? What's your
phone number? And what's your website?"
Right? And so what this does is that it
takes the details from someone filling
up the form on the website and then it
uses Plexity to do the research on that
website before giving us an answer that
we can add to our CRM. So let's build
it. This right here is going to be um
the same because it's pretty much
standard. Uh I'm going to change the
prompts a little bit, but apart from
that it's fine. And I can do on form
submission because we're making a form
and this will be the first step in this
case. I can go inside and I can put a
name for the form which is website form.
By the way, don't worry about these.
Test URL is just the URL that we use
when you're testing. Production we use
when we set the automation to active.
Authentication is if you want to put a
password, but we don't want to. Uh we
have the title and this is please fill
out the form with your details. Then we
can add form element which is saying hey
what are the questions? In this case we
can ask them actually full name. Yeah.
And we can say company name.
We can say
uh company website which is the thing
that we'll actually use.
I believe that it has date checkboxes.
No or email only. Um and that's it.
Right. We can just ask three different
questions. Of course, a company would
probably want to know what is your
budget, what are you looking to to do
and so on. But these are three simple
questions. So I can execute step and I
can say Mike authority company name is
jmolutions
my website is jmsolutions.com
submit. This should now send a signal
here with the details that we can then
use for the next steps. So I can pin the
information which means that now I don't
have to rerun it again every single time
that I want to run the automation. And
now the only thing that goes into this
is not the chat input because you're not
chatting to it anymore. What we're doing
is we can define the user message below
and again user message is the thing that
we actually give to the agent every
single time that is different. In this
case it will be the company website and
what we can do is actually do company
website
company name actually and then company
website.
Company name. There we go. Here company
name.
And there you go. company name and
company website is the thing that goes
into the AI agent for it to use when
making research of that company. So I'm
going to say
you are a helpful assistant that helps
to do research on new companies that
come through. You could say that, right?
Assistant. Yeah, you can say that. Uh
and then let's say uh for rules. So I'm
going to say we are or actually the the
research that we are looking for from
the company
should contain target audience and let's
do
offer. So we want to know the offer of
the company and target audience. That's
it. I believe this should work. Uh let's
see if it doesn't. If it doesn't, we'll
change the prompt. And now this will be
the same. Yeah, this will be the same.
Let's test this out. Let's go here.
Well, actually, no. Yeah, we can't use
the simple memory because the simple
memory only works when we using a chat
model. So, when we're chatting to it,
like a chatbot. But in this case, we're
not doing it. So, we're just using um
these two. Let me press go execute
workflow. You see how I didn't have to
fill out the form every single time.
Now, it's doing research. And then at
the end, it gives us James Solutions
targets SMBs looking to improve
operational efficiency through
innovative workflow automation solutions
XYZ. [music] Cool. Which now we can add
to our CRM. So I can just make a new
Google sheet. I can name it say CRM
new
website leads. I can say company name or
full name. There you go. Full name.
Company name.
Let me zoom in so you can see here. Go
X. I can do company website
and research. I can make this black,
white, bold,
and reset to row one like this. I can
still see it. Cool. And now I have to
connect Google Sheets to any. And to do
that, I can go here. I can press plus. I
can go to Google Sheets.
I can then append a row in a sheet.
Append just means you're adding a row
into a sheet. Connect your account by
going here. Just press sign in with
Google, which will take you to this
page. You can press your account that
you are connected with and once you're
connected you can go to sheet within a
document append a row because that is
the action that we're taking. The
document would be CRM new website leads
the sheet will be sheet one. Yep. And
then the values to send. So this is
saying hey what do we want to add here
here and here every single time that it
runs. We would like to add the full name
which you can get on the left hand side
on the form. So full name, company name,
company website, research,
and something more that we want to add
is submission date. So submission date
because we ideally want to know exactly
what date and time they submitted the
form. This now refreshes because it saw
that I changed something within the
sheet. I can then add submitted at right
here. But the problem is that if I go if
I press this to go full screen, this
right here is very messy. And so what I
want to do here is actually format it so
it's readable to a normal human who has
no clue what t01 all of this stuff is.
So what I can do is I can go in here and
I can put dot to date format I believe
and I can say what is it? Format date
format. Yeah. Okay, cool. Let me go into
the formatting guide so I can see how to
make a date look normal. God, this is
horrible. Let me see here. August 6th,
2014. This will be DD.
All I have to do here is just put DD.
There we go. 16th of October, 2025. And
this will be the format that we add the
date inside of the Google sheet. So now
I can pin this data, which means that I
don't have to rerun this again. I can
just press go. What this should now do
is she would send the information here
to the Google sheet. Mikuela James
solutions with the website with the
research which it's very long. Let me
make this a bit bigger.
Why not go here
you can then read about offer and who
they're targeting and submission date as
well. So you get to know exactly when
they submitted the form. And there there
is a use case that you can use the
research AI agent for to do research on
someone when they come through from the
website or some sort of input from
somewhere else. And we built this type
of system for a company before uh a bit
more extensive. So a bit more stuff um
but it did research on new leads that
came through the website and then it
looked at their social media, it looked
at their website, it looked at
everything that they had to then give it
to the sales reps right in their CRM
before the sales reps actually called
the lead, right? Because they had more
information. they were more prepared um
before actually going out and selling to
customers.
In this video, I'm going to show you
exactly how I built a voice agent inside
of 11 Labs and connected it to Nitn that
allows us to be able to send emails, get
[music] contacts, and schedule calendar
events. All right, so on the left hand
side, I have the voice agent in 11 Labs.
On the right hand side, I have the AI
agent in Nitn. I'm going to press
execute workflow, which is now waiting
for the voice agent to send information
to the AI agent. And I'm going to go and
talk to the AI agent here.
>> Hey, my man. How's it going?
>> What's up, brother? Um, can we schedule
a calendar event for tomorrow at 5:00
p.m. with Michael James and just say
that it's for celebratory meeting?
>> All righty. I'm setting up that
celebratory meeting for you with Michael
James for tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. Boom.
>> Your celebratory meeting with Michael
James is also for tomorrow at 5:00 PM.
Is there anything else I can help you
with today, you magn?
>> That's it. Magnificent. What?
Magnificent. There we go. So, we have a
calendar here and the name celebratory
meeting scheduled for this email, which
is Michael James, which you can find
right here in our database with Michael
James in this email as well. There you
go. All right. So, we're going to go
through the whole process step by step.
The first step is actually going to 11
Labs and seeing how we actually set this
up. So, if I go here to the actual
homepage, so when you make an account on
11 Labs, you will have this dashboard
right here. All you have to go is here
and you go to agent platform. So
typically you'll be in the creative
platform which is for voices and so on.
In this case you want to go to agent
platform. Want to press agent new agent
right here. When you press a new agent
you'll come on this page right here. And
this is where you start adding all the
settings. So the first message is what
is the first thing that the AI voice
agent will say. In this case as you can
see by or as you could have heard uh by
the voice agent it said hey my man how's
it going? And this is important because
it's the first thing that the AI agent
says. Then the assistant prompt in this
case is this. So, so we said you're a
friendly and funny personal assistant
who loves helping the user with tasks in
an upbeat and approachable way. Your
role is to assist the user with sending
emails and scheduling calendar events.
When the user provides details like who
the email is for and what it's about,
you will pass the information to any end
tool and wait for its response. If the
user tells you that he wants to schedule
a calendar event, then you will pass the
information to the N10 tool and wait for
its response. Once you get the
confirmation from any that the email has
been sent, truthfully let the user know
it's done and ask if there's anything
else you can help with. And I can also
add something else here. Once you get
confirmation from any that the event was
created, truthfully let the user know
once it's done. [music]
Now basically the way this works is that
we have the voice agent that we speak to
sort of like a person and when we give
information to the voice agent what that
does is that it sends information to our
AI agent in any sort of acting as a back
end to then do the actual thing that we
told it to do and then send back a
response right to the actual voice agent
saying hey everything is good. It's sort
of like you have the CEO who talks to
the head of sales. the sales guy in this
case does the action then he goes back
to the head of sales saying yeah
everything was good and then the head of
sales talks to the CEO right the CEO
doesn't actually talk to the um the
actual sales guy because there's a
intermediate step there's a step in
between and so this is the exact same
thing here between me and N10 it's 11
laps is me talking to 11 laps which then
speaks [music] to the backend system
which is N10 and so what we have here
again is a prompt dynamic variables
leave this blank llm I use Gemini 2.5
five flash cuz it's pretty cheap plus
fast. Uh the backup LM configuration,
leave this as default. You can leave
this as default. The thinking budget is
fine right here. We don't need to
control any internal reasoning tokens.
The temperature right here is basically
controlling how creative do you want the
AI agent to be. The higher the
temperature, the more creative it is.
The lower the temperature, which means
it's deterministic, so we can determine
exactly what it's going to say. It's
less temperature. Now, for voice agent,
you want to be careful with this. You
want to make sure that it's not too
creative because then it goes outside of
the instructions that you give it. But
you also want to make sure that it's not
too deterministic, which means that it's
not too fixed into the instructions
because then we'll have the problem that
it starts sounding like a robot. Limit
token usage. And so we're basically
predicting or we're limiting the amount
of money, the amount of tokens which
equals to money credits uh that we're
using for the LLM. LLM just stands for
large language model. is like chat GBT,
Claude, Gemini, Grock, all these are
LLMs. Then you can also add a agent
knowledge base in case you want to add
documents that you want the AI agent, in
this case the voice agent to have access
to when giving you back the answer,
which is great. And now for the thing
that we really care about is the tools,
custom tools. So this is how we connect
custom tools to any or how we connect
voice agent to any. So if you can just
press add a tool, you will get to this
page right here. You have to put a name.
In this case, you can just put N10. And
the description is use this tool to take
action upon the user's request. And then
the first thing we're doing is adding a
web hook. Now, for those of you who
don't know what a web hook is, a web
hook is a URL, which in this case looks
like this, which in any way to set it up
is go here, add a trigger, and then a
web hook call. So on the web hook call
right here. And now this is a thing that
is used when we want to receive a
signal. So from the voice agent, we say,
"Hey, can you do this for me?" It sends
all the signal to the automation to
actually do it. And that's what a web
hook is used for. Make sure this is post
because post is the way that we send
information. Get is the way that we get
information. By get, I mean get here.
Now, I've made a full video showing you
exactly web hooks, HTTP APIs, all that
good stuff. You can check it out up
here. But that's what we use to send
information to the actual AI agent
inside of N10. Response timeout is how
long to wait for the client tool to
respond before timing out. The default
is 20 seconds. This is great in case
your actual workflow, your AI agent
inside of N10 has an error and it
doesn't actually send back the
information. And so we're just putting
some precautions saying, "Hey, if it
doesn't send back the information, just
let the user know. Leave this all as is.
Leave headers the same, path parameters
the same, query parameters the same. And
finally, we have body parameters." So
body parameters are the thing that we
say the instructions or the variables
that we send [music] to any AI agent for
it to actually take action. So in this
case there are three things that we have
to send over. As you can see by the
description I said ask the user to
provide the name of the email recipient
and what the email is about unless they
already provided the information and ask
them for the calendar event date and
time if they're looking to schedule an
event. Now in terms of properties we
have to send different variables to the
actual workflow. Why? As you can see
here, if I go inside the web hook, which
is the thing that we use again to send
the data, once we said, "Hey, I want to
schedule a calendar event with Michael
James, call it celebratory dinner at
5:00 p.m., what it did is that it sent
the body parameters." So, who are we
doing the thing for? What is the event
description? And what is the calendar
event time? And so, these variables are
crucial in making sure that the AI agent
in N10 understands what it is that we
want to do. and as well who are we doing
it for or what other variables need to
be taken into account when actually
doing the actual thing and so [music] in
11 labs we want to start adding
properties. So the first property is two
which is who the email is going to or
who to schedule the event with or for
yeah and make this required because
we're going to need this either way and
leave [snorts] this as an imprompt
because we're leaving AI to decide this
variable right here. The second one is
email content so what the email is
about. I made sure that this is not
required just because sometimes we want
to schedule a calendar event and we
don't need to send the email content. So
this is not required. Leave this as LM
prompt because it allows us to let AI
define this as well. I didn't mention
this but string just means text, right?
In this case you can do integer number
object array. We just want to keep it
simple. This is literally just text
that's going into the web hook. So leave
this as is. This is the name of the
event for the calendar. Now that I'm
thinking of it, this doesn't have to be
required because sometimes we just want
to send an email. We don't want to
schedule a calendar event. And then
finally, calendar event time, which is
what the event time and date is at,
which is not required, which is used
when we want to schedule a calendar
event. And leave the last thing as is.
So that right there is just setting up
the tool, which is all we really need in
order to connect 11 Labs to Nitn. Now,
once we have this, let's go to Nitn and
see exactly how it looks. So this right
here is the AI agent that we're using.
In case it's your first time looking at
the AI agent inside of Niten, stop this
video, watch this video up here where I
show you the AI agent fundamentals.
Trust me, it will make much more sense
once you watch that video. Um, but
essentially an AI agent is consisted of
an input and an output. In this case,
the input can be who are we sending the
email to or who are we scheduling the
calendar event uh for. Then we have the
event description or we have the email
content or we have all the different
variables that I spoke to you about
based on what the user wants to do. Then
we have the output which is a message
that is sent back to the voice agent
saying yeah everything was good. Then we
have the AI agent in the middle which is
the thing that actually takes action
right then we have the brain which in
this case it's open AAI it's the way it
actually thinks and then we have the
different tools which is what are the
softwares that are connected to the AI
agent for it to actually do the thing
that it needs to do. So the first thing
is a web hook. We want to make sure that
this is post because that's the method
that we use on the 11 labs. And when you
get the data here, you will see a ton of
variables. Honestly, I have no clue what
any of them are. But the only thing that
you really have to care about is the
body. So the body is the actual
variables that we get from the voice
agent for us to use when we want to
actually take action on whatever it is.
And so we get in this case to Michael
James event description celebratory
meeting and calendar event time tomorrow
at 5 [music] p.m. And that's all you
need to then send to the AI agent with a
user prompt which is usually a message
that we give to the AI agent that
changes every single time cuz in this
case we have the prompt user message and
we have the system message. The system
message is more so for instructions. So
we say hey here's where you are here's
the instructions just follow this
[music] and then here is where we give
the variables that change every single
time. Now as you can see this is code
right here but what this means is the
person details so who are we sending the
email to which you get from here if I
make this smaller two if I drag this
across I can see that is JSON.pbody.2
Email content is not something that
always shows up depending on what the
user wants to do. And calendar event
time and event description is something
that we add here. Event title and uh
calendar event time as well. And so we
drag these variables across right here.
And again, if you want to add this right
here, you would have to run the voice
agent and tell it, hey, can you send an
email? And that will send an email here.
And it will give you this variable
because this variable is only available
when you want to send an email. And
that's it for the user prompt. So very,
very easy. We just give it the variables
and now we get onto the system message
which is the instructions. Now if you
get the full blueprint for free you will
be able to have the whole prompt. So
don't worry um or else take a screenshot
of this and then put it to chat GBT and
tell it to extract the text from the
image. But what we're doing here is
we're using the typical prompt format
which is overview. So you're a friendly
witty personal assistant who helps users
send emails get contacts and schedule
meetings XYZ. Then we give the tools. So
the tool name plus the description. It
sends an email only when instructed or
when email content is provided. So when
the variable email content is given and
then schedule calendar event and so on
and then instructions the rule and
finally current date and time. Now the
reason why we give the AI current date
and time is because AI isn't the best at
guessing or knowing the date and time of
today. So with this prompt we're then
able to take action right and the next
step we have to do is connect our AI
agent to the brain which is in this case
is OpenAI. And to connect OpenAI, you
have to go to platform.openai.com,
log in, make an account, and then go to
dashboard. You can go to API keys, go to
create a new secret key, name it, get
the key, and then bring it back to nan
right here, which is basically a
password that says, hey, you can use my
OpenAI account, and then you press save.
Now, leave this as GBT 4.1 Mini is more
than good for what we want to do. And
then we have the tools. So, we connected
this to three different tools. The first
tool is Google Sheets to get contacts,
which is this right here. Then we have
Google Calendar right here to schedule
calendar events, which is this right
here. And finally, we want to send
emails to our Gmail, which is this right
here. And so the theory behind this is
that if you noticed, I didn't actually
give the voice agent an email. I just
gave it a name. And so that's why we
have the step of retrieving the contact
email from the Google Sheets here where
we have the name and then we have the
email. So if I said to the voice agent,
hey, can you send an email to Michael
James? I instructed the AI agent to know
that it has to look at here first to be
able to get the email to then take the
action, right? And so it will go here.
It will say Michael James, Michael James
has this email. And this is the email
that we're going to use to be able to
schedule the calendar event or send the
email to the actual person. And so we go
in here to connect your Google Sheets.
All you have to do is create your
credential, sign in with Google. It will
take you to the standard um login with
Google page. Once you connected your
account, make sure to have sheet within
document. You want to get rows, which is
the action that we're taking. Again, get
rows just means get all the rows from
the actual Google sheet, which is that
one right here as mentioned. So, it gets
all of them, and then it decides who is
who. Then you want to choose the exact
Google sheet. Uh, contact database USB.
And then the sheet within the Google
sheet will be sheet one. And finally,
that's when you get the actual output,
which is row number two. The name is
Michael James. the name is John Lori,
James Low, James Arthur with the emails
as well. And based on what the user
added as a um sort of input, it will
then choose the corresponding email. So
if it's Michael James, he will choose
this. If it's John Lori, it will choose
this. If it's James Low, this James
Arthur this. And that's for the first
tool. Then we have schedule calendar
event. Again, same exact concept. Go
here sign in with Google. So you can
connect your calendar tool description
set automatically. The resource, which
is what is the thing that we're
manipulating. In this case, it will be
the event. the operation which is what
is the action that we're taking. We're
creating an event. The calendar will be
my calendar and then start and end. We
can simply just press these two buttons
[music] which basically means that we're
letting the model we're letting AI
define these two parameters. We want to
turn this on so that we don't have to do
it manually which is the beauty of AI
agents. Then we have two different
fields that we want to fill out. The
first one is attendees which you can
find here attendees and then you simply
do the same thing here which is just
pressing the AI which in this case the
model itself will send the attendee
email over right here and then the
summary you can pull from the where is
it event description over here and that
will be the title of the actual meeting
and that's how we get the calendar event
to look like this where we have the
title and it sends it to the right
person and then finally we have the send
email so if I go here same exact concept
just go here send sign in with Google
set automatically the resource that we
are manipulating will be a message the
action that we're taking is we're
sending a message the beautiful thing
about any AI agents to set up tools is
that we literally just have to press
three buttons and that's it so we're
letting AI define who are we sending the
email to what is the subject line and
what is the message and what we could do
here as well is turn this off append
attribution so that at the end of the
email it doesn't say this was sent by
anything and finally we use a respond to
web hook node
which responds with the first incoming
item, which is this right here. The
celebratory meeting with Michael James
has been scheduled for tomorrow. If you
need me to send an emails or add more
details, then let me know. And that will
be the thing that's sent to the actual
voice agent in 11 Labs. So, think of
this as a boomerang, right? We have the
voice agent here. It then goes here and
then it brings it back to the voice
agent, right? Sort of like again, we're
talking to an employee to the head of
department. Employee back to the head of
department to the CEO. All right. So,
I'm going to test this again. And in
this case, let's do sending an email.
And we can send the email to James
Arthur. So, right here, I can call the
AI agent.
>> Hey, my man. How's it going?
>> What's up, brother? Uh, can you send an
email to James Arthur? And can you say
that we are disappointed in your work?
You should have done better in
yesterday's meeting. And that you are
almost about to get fired.
>> All right. I am sending that email to
James Arthur right away. Oh, there. I
found a James Arthur with the email
mish.cal5gmail.com.
Should I send it to that address? Also,
that message is a bit strong. Would you
like me to help you rephrase it a little
more gently?
>> Nah, you're good. Just send that email
over.
>> Understood. Sending that email now. No
holds barred. Oopsie. It seems like
there was a little hiccup and I couldn't
send that email. Don't worry, it's not
you. It's probably just a glitch with my
system.
>> Can you try Can you try again?
>> I'm on it. Let's try sending that email
one more time. Oh, dread. Seems like I'm
still having a bit of trouble sending
that email.
>> Okay, so there was trouble sending the
email. Let's see why. I thought it was
because it needed to confirm, but in
this case, let's let's go inside here.
And we actually did get the email
content. So that's weird. So I think
that is within the prompt itself. Uh
send an email only when instructed or
when email content is provided. M
interesting. So in this case, what I
would do, I would just test it again.
And [music] it might have been a hiccup
on the 11 lab side. And by the way, when
you go live, you don't have to execute
the workflow every single time. just for
testing purposes, we do, which is why
when he was trying again, he said there
was a hiccup because I had to rerun this
again and I didn't give enough time for
me to press run and it actually sending
the information. Uh, so let's test the
AI agent again.
>> Hey, my man, how's it going?
>> Yo, can you send an email to Michael
James saying that we have dinner
tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. Uh, and just send
it through.
>> All right, I'm sending that email right
away. Oops. It [clears throat] looks
like I need a little more information to
send that email to Michael James. Seems
I didn't get the full email content or a
clear event title. Could you please tell
me exactly what you'd like the email to
say? And if you want me to schedule this
as a calendar event, what should the
event be called?
>> Uh just just name the email. Um the
email is about just having dinner
tomorrow and it's to Michael James. And
no, we don't have to schedule any
calendar event.
>> Got it. Just the email then. Sending
[music] it off to Michael James now. Oh
no, it seems like there was a little
hiccup. The email didn't go through. My
apologies. It looks like I'm having some
trouble connecting right now. Could you
perhaps try again in a little bit? Or is
there something else I can help you with
in the meantime?
>> Yeah, try again. Try again.
>> You got it. Let's give that email
another shot for Michael James. Well,
shucks. Seems like I'm still getting a
bit confused.
>> All right. So, I think it's because I
don't have the variable here, which is
called email content. So, I'm going to
add this there and try again.
>> Hey, my man. How's it going?
>> Yo, can you send an email to Michael
James saying that we have a meeting
tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.?
>> All right. I'm sending that email for
you. Consider it done. I've sent your
email to Michael James with a message
about the meeting tomorrow at 5. Is
there anything else?
>> Great. So, we know why. Now, if I go to
my email, I can see that we have the
meeting reminder at 5:00 p.m. from JM
Solutions, which is the email that I
connected to NATO. Now to explain the
problem that I just got because you're
going to have a similar problem as well.
Uh is [music] that inside the prompt I
actually told in the rules that you
should only send an email if you
actually receive a variable called email
content. But here I actually had this
deleted and I didn't have the name for
the email content. It was just the
actual email content. And so by adding
the name it then recognizes that we got
this variable which means that now it's
allowed to send an email. So that right
there is how you can make a voice agent
inside of Lemon Labs and connect it to
our AI agent inside of N10.
In this video, I'm going to show you how
I built a trading [music] analyst AI
agent inside of N10. You can chat to it
on Telegram and ask it to check any
[music] stock. It'll find the chart,
study it with AI, and tell you exactly
what it sees, like [music] if it's going
up or down, and how strong it looks. It
can even compare two stocks and tell you
which one looks better. All right, so
the AI agent is divided into two
different parts. We have the AI agent
here and then we have the tool that we
call which is the next workflow which is
this one right here which is made to
then get this sort of chart analyze it
with AI and give us the answer back. All
right. So I just turned this on. So it's
now waiting for a message. I can say can
you analyze Microsoft
then go what this will now do is it will
talk to the AI agent which again is
prompted with instructions. It then
starts calling the tool right here which
is this right here. So if I go here to
executions, I can see now that this is
running. So there's a current workflow
running, which means that it's giving us
the answer and it's getting it back. And
then it's going to be able to then give
us the whole analysis back on Telegram.
And now it's going to give us the actual
analysis over here. So overall trend,
recent price and action, support and
resistance levels, MACD, which in case
you don't know, I also don't know, and
volume analysis, overall market
sentiment. So basically a full breakdown
of the stock because traders go look at
this pretty much every single day,
right? They look at this, they look if
it's going up or down. And so this AI
will do that for you, saving you that
time of doing it yourself. And one more
thing that it can do as well is it can
compare two different stocks. So I can
say here, can you now compare Apple with
Microsoft and I can go [music] play.
What this will now do is it will send it
again to the actual tool. But the only
difference now is that it will do it
twice. So it will send the first item
which in this case it will be either
Microsoft or Apple. It [music] then
analyzes Microsoft. It will get the
graph then we'll get the graph of Apple
and then it will give us the full
analysis of both stocks together. As
[music] you can see it was smart enough
to know that it already sent us the
graph for Microsoft. So what it did is
it sent us the graph for Apple right
here and it then gave us the actual
[music] analysis of overall trend recent
price MCD volume analysis support and
resistance and current market
positioning for both Apple and
Microsoft. So now you're able to
actually compare each one individually
in all the different uh categories right
here which are about six and we [music]
have the key takeaways as well. And to
me this is insane because now we're able
to analyze stocks individually but also
compare them and have AI do the whole
thing for us. With that said let's go
through step by step exactly how it
works and how we set it up. So this
right here is a typical structure of an
AI agent. Right? We have the input, we
have the output. Now in this case the
input will be Telegram. So the first
step is [music] actually connecting our
Telegram account. You can do this by
going here, press this button, let AI
tell you step by step what you have to
do. It's a longer process than than I
would explain in just two minutes. And
as you can see right here, this is the
output, right? And the output in this
case is update ID, message ID, from ID
is bot, first name, language, all these
things we don't really have to know. The
only two variables that we really care
about is chatter ID because this allows
us to actually send back a message in
the same thread. It's sort of like
you're having a conversation with, let's
say, your friend. You don't want to be
sending a reply to another guy, right?
You want to be sending the reply to the
same exact conversation. And so this
right here is the conversation. It's
just numbered. And then we have the
text. So the text right here is the
actual text, right? It's the actual text
of what we ask the AI agent to do. And
that's what it will use to then send to
the AI agent which is instructed, it's
prompted to do different things uh to
then take action. We connect the input
to an AI agent which has a prompt
inside. So I'll go through that in just
a second. But the AI agent in this case
is connected to a brain which in this
case it's Claude. And to connect your
cloud account, you have to go here, go
to anthropic.com console, login,
go here, create a key, put a name for
it. So let's do N10 add. And then you'll
get this key [music] that you'll then
paste. If you go back here, then choose
the model. In this case, we have
different models. Cloth 3.5 sonnet is
fine. We usually look for uh quality
plus speed. But for something like this,
I think quality is more important than
speed because it is quite a technical
sort of topic. So we want to make sure
that it actually is good. Then we have
the memory. So you connect this right
here memory which in this case is just a
simple memory tool which is N and it
ends memory tool and we give it the
context window of five. Now what this
means is that it takes the previous five
conversations or the previous five
messages sent by me which is great
because like you saw I told it hey now
compare Apple with Microsoft. So it
remembered already that we already
analyzed Microsoft. So what it has to do
now is just analyze Apple. And it's all
because we have this exact uh memory
[music] tool. And one more thing that we
add here is a chat ID. This is so that
it remembers the actual chat that we're
having with the AI agent. And then
finally, we have a tool. Now, before I
get to the tool, let's go through the
prompt inside here. It will be a tools
agent because we're using tools. Define
the find below, which is a user prompt,
which is what is the thing that we're
telling the AI agent to do, which in
this case, like I mentioned, is the text
right here. So, we drag this across.
And then we have the system message. So,
if I go here, this prompt is quite
extensive, as in it's pretty detailed.
And by the way, if you want a full
blueprint, I'll show you at the end how
you can get it. And right here, we're
not doing any rocket science. We're
using the exact same prompt structure
that I mentioned on my video up here,
which is prompting AI agents. And that
is using an overview. So, you are an AI
agent specializing in XYZ, giving it an
identity. Then, we have context. So,
things that it needs to know, and then
instructions, because it's important for
it to know exactly step by step what to
do. Then we have tools. So tools is very
important because then it knows what to
call what action to take based on what
we tell it to do. Then we have examples
which is the assistant prompt which
means that we give it a few examples so
it has some context when it actually
does the thing and in this case we give
it three examples and then finally SOPs
which is pretty much the same as
instructions
and final notes which are some final
things final rules to give it. And so in
this prompt, what we basically say is,
look, the user is going to ask you for a
stock to analyze. What you have to do is
just call this tool when you want to
analyze any stock. And so this tool
right here, what it is, it's connecting
or it's calling a different workflow
inside of any tech, which is the one
right here, which I'll go in in just a
second. And so this isn't a typical AI
agent where you just connect a software
directly here and it takes action on the
same workflow. This is an AI agent that
calls a different workflow and then gets
a response back just like a boomerang.
Now, if I go inside here, the only thing
we have to do is name it. So, get chart.
And the reason why we added get chart on
the prompt is so that it knows that this
is the get chart tool. And now that I
think of it, I think [music] I called it
I think I added a space in the prompt.
So, let me go here and edit it. Uh,
get chart is fine actually. Get chart.
Okay, that's fine.
Make sure that the name of the tool is
exactly the same as the name in the
prompt. So get chart and then the
description which is what does it
actually do in this case call this tool
to get an analysis of a [music]
requested stock. Please return the URL
from this tool in marked on formatting
for example this URL. And the reason why
we ask the image to be in this format
it's so that it can then send it over to
us on telegram [music] in a format in a
way where it actually makes sense. Then
we have the source. So this is saying
okay we're calling this tool which is
calling another workflow which in this
case is here called anything workflow
tool and right here we give it a
description of the workflow and then we
have source and source and workflow just
means what do you want to call in this
case we want to call the name of the
workflow which we have right here. So to
set this up, you have to make a
completely new workflow and make sure
that you have this node right here which
is I believe
uh when executed by another workflow
which is the one right here and so
you're sending the data and then you're
getting the data back which in this case
the from list it will be to technical
analyst agent because that is the name
of this right here and again I'll give
you the whole blueprint for free so you
can just play around with it and so with
this done what we get in the technical
technical analysis agent. If I go here
to executions and I go to the previous
one and I can press this button, copy to
editor, which will show me exactly the
data that I previously mentioned before,
we get this. Now, for those of you who
are new to the trading world and stocks,
it actually isn't that hard. If I go to
Apple stock,
I can see that Apple stock isn't
actually called Apple. It's called AAPL,
right? NASDAQ, which is again the boss
of all the different stocks in the US.
And then we have APL which is in this
case called a ticker which is a short
version of Apple ink right and so when
we want to send it to the actual thing
to make the chart and so on we have to
give it in a way where it actually
understands. So we can't say Apple ink
we have to say AAPL which is why we call
them tickers. once we receive the ticker
from these AI agent right here. And so
what would happen here is that we give
it a can you now compare Apple with
Microsoft and it will know that now
Apple needs to be turned into a ticker
which will then be sent here to the tool
which will then be sent here which is
the actual workflow and which is this
and then this will be the thing that we
now use to actually make the chart and
download it. Now the question you've
been asking yourself is how do we make
charts like these? How does this happen?
We have to go to a platform called
chart/image.com
which is the one right here.
chartsimage.com
and you want to be able to make an
account. So, sign in.
And this is completely free. The only
caveat to this is that we have a daily
limit of 50. So, you can only call this
50 times. The next step you want to do
is go to the API documentation, which is
just a documentation that says, "Hey,
here's how you can use it." Right? on
the left hand side just understand that
the base URL which is a URL that we have
to call this is always sort of like a
link that you say hey server do this for
me this is the start of the link and
then to actually be able to call the
right exact graph because we have tons
of graphs that we can't call we can get
this we can get this we can get all
these in this case we have to choose the
right one so if I go here to the graph
that we want if I go under I can then
see something called a curl now a curl
is something that we just literally just
paste into a HTTP node which is a just a
square [music] inside of Nitn that will
do everything for us. So all you have to
do really is copy this curl right here.
Go to Niten and then be able to just add
a HTTP request and then all you have to
do here is import curl. So you go here,
you paste this and you import it and you
will have this. And that's when you
start filling things out. Now, if you
get the blueprint, you won't have to set
this up, but at least now you know
exactly how it works. And right here is
where we start adding everything. Now,
one thing you have to add is / storage
because then it allows us to be able to
get this as a URL format and make sure
everything's good. Make sure this is
posted so that we send the information
of the ticker and then we get something
back which in this case is a URL of the
actual um stock. And then we have to put
the X API key. Again, the API key is
something that you can find here. API
key generate a new key here and then
copy it
and then content type. Make sure this is
application/json
because all in all you just want it to
give you the right format right and then
finally the thing that matters the most
is this right here which is what are we
actually telling the the server to do.
As you can see here this is the body. We
call this the body which is what is the
instructions that we tell the actual
server to do like what stock are we
asking it to to get. In [music] this
case, you can see that we have a symbol
which is NASDAQ colon ticker which we
get from the actual previous steps. Now,
as I showed you before, the way that the
stock is represented is NASDAQ colon
apple, right? Ticker. So, we want to do
the exact same thing right here. NASDAQ
colon ticker. And so, with that said,
what it returns to us is the URL of the
actual stock right here, like I've
showed you. And then finally, you want
to put response format JSON because we
added up here that we want the content
type to be JSON as well. So just make
sure you have this and you have this
here. So [music] you're able to get the
URL of the actual stock. Once this is
done, then we want to be able to
download the chart. So download the
actual URL because this isn't publicly
available so that OpenAI or AI can
actually go inside the image and analyze
it. [music] So the next step is just
using a simple HTTP request to get the
link and download it. Execute the step
which looks like this. We get it in a
binary format. Binary is just the way
that an image or file is represented in
the web. Which then goes to the next
step which is stock analysis which is an
AI. So we choose OpenAI and the way to
connect your OpenAI is just by going to
platform.AI.com.
You can log in. You can go to dashboard
on the left hand side. You can go to API
keys create a new secret key right here
and then put a name and then create the
key like we did for claude. Bring it
back here. put the API key here and then
make sure you choose image which is the
thing that we're actually using and the
action that we're taking is analyzing
image the model can be GBT40 that is
good enough and then we give it a whole
prompt so text input which is telling it
hey you'll be given an image now just
assess the image analyze the actual
chart based on the candlestick analysis
MACD analysis volume support actionable
other observations that it then uses
based on the binary data data here data
data that we give it as an input. So you
want to make sure that this is binary.
And I remember thinking that binary was
such a complex thing, but what it
actually is, it's just literally a way
for the web server to represent files.
And so what we say here is we say, hey,
here's the input, which isn't a binary
file. And the name of the input is data
because that is the name of the variable
that we get. So just put data here. And
in detail can be auto that's fine. And
now what it does is that it takes the
actual stock and then it gives us the
output which is this right here which is
candlestick analysis. If I go to JSON I
can see the whole thing right here.
Potential breakout zone. The price is
approaching 270. It's giving us a whole
breakdown analysis of that stock which
we keep for now. And we go to the next
step which is Telegram. And if you have
the connection that you made before use
the exact same connection. In this case
it will be message which is the actual
thing that we're manipulating or
changing. The action that we're taking
is send a photo because we're sending
the actual graph. We're not actually
sending the explanation first. And the
chatter ID is a thing that I mentioned
that we called or that we had right
here. Chat ID schema chat ID. This is
only a one time thing, right? Because
once you copy this here, it will send
everything to that specific
conversation. So once you copy this from
there, you'll then be able to have the
photo URL be sent from here URL which is
a thing that makes it look like this in
Telegram. And then finally the actual
thing that goes back to the AI agent
here for it to actually finish is the
last step of the workflow which in this
case is here which is response. And the
response will just be the analysis that
we get from uh where is it stock
analysis here which is a content right
here. And this is the thing that then
goes back to the AI agent inside here as
an output.
And finally, we made the graph. It sent
to our channel. It then sent the
analysis back to the AI agent. It
formatted it in a way where it actually
makes sense. And finally, it sent it to
Telegram right here with the child ID,
which you can get here, chat ID, and the
output, which in this case is here,
output, and make sure that this is
message, and send a message. So, let's
try this out one more time. I can go
here. I can say, can you analyze Amazon?
And by the way, not all stocks are going
to be recognized here, right? Like
something like Samsung isn't part of
NASDAQ to my understanding, to my
knowledge. Um, and so if you put Samsung
or something like that, it will not
detect it on the next workflow because
it is not part of that subset of stocks.
And so make sure that whatever stock you
ask it to do is within the category that
we added when we asked to make the
chart. So now it's giving us the chart
which did it in the other workflow. Then
finally here it give us the actual
trend. Now I'm going to do something
interesting that I haven't done before.
So let me actually execute the workflow
again. Let me go here and let me ask it
can you now
compare Amazon with Apple and with
Microsoft.
I go here. I'm interested to see what
this does. if it remembers this, if it
remembers the other one as well and what
the output will give us and it seems
like it doesn't actually call the tool
because it already analyzed the three of
them which is amazing brilliant because
now we have the full analysis here so
overall trend Amazon Apple Microsoft
recent price action MCD analysis so let
me say which one should I buy when I go
enter
let's see which one tells me that I
should buy based on this anal analysis
right here. As you can see, we have this
here. As an AI assistant, I'm not able
to provide specific investment advice or
recommendation. Fair enough. Yeah. So, I
guess we'll just have to look at this
right here and decide for ourselves.
There you go. All right. So, this right
here is obviously a very cool use case.
Uh, but it should give you ideas for
other use cases that you can build,
right? And the ability for us to call
different tools within our AI agents and
then bring it back all in one place. And
that's the beauty of tools within the AI
agent because you can talk to it as if
it's a normal human, but it can take
actions on different things. And again,
it all depends on what tools there are
out there, like the image chart tool.
Because if it wasn't for this, we
wouldn't be able to actually do this.
Hey, I'm about to build a live Instagram
paraset system right in front of you
that scripts post from the top AI news
Instagram account in the world, rewrites
them your tone of voice using AI, and
turns them into a stream of content that
you can post automatically. [music]
All right, so this right here is a
system. I can press execute workflow.
This will now run the automation.
Ideally, we run this every single week.
Uh then we scrape the Instagram post
from the top AI news account in the
world on Instagram using Apify. [music]
As we can see here, this is currently
running. Then we wait 5 seconds before
actually getting all the data and then
looping it through. So, we only let 20
posts at a time. In this case here,
we're checking whether it's actually
relevant to our target audience before
sending it to the next AI to actually
rewrite the post and then adding it all
back to our Google sheet database. All
right, we can see it just ran
successfully. I can go to the Google
database. I can see here that we have
the username of the account. In this
case, it's the same. The date when the
post was posted, the post URL we have
here. We can always look back the
original post and the rewritten post
using our ton of voice, target audience,
and so on. So, [music] we have every
single week a stream of content ideas.
So, we can then post automatically that
are repurposed using our tone of voice.
So, now let me save this. Let me make a
new automation. All right, we start from
scratch. And again, the first uh step of
always building the automation is not
actually building it itself. It's going
on Miro to map things out, to break it
down step by step before we actually go
out and build it. So, if I go here, I
always look at an automation as an input
and an output
and then in between there's different
steps that we have to just figure it
out. Well, the input in this case is I
guess someone else's content because we
are doing a parasite system and parasite
just means that you that you just steal
someone else's idea and then you just
repurpose it for your own uh target
audience. [music] In this case, if I
wanted to get the latest AI news and I
wanted to use Instagram, I have to find
an account where they posted the latest
AI news and it was the top in the world.
So initially what I would do is I would
go here and say what is the top AI news
Instagram account in the world and then
I would get this right here evolving AI.
So go here. Let me see what they have.
Yeah. So they're pretty big Reddit users
go viral after revealing prom tricks and
try to almost feel like cheat. Yeah I
think that's pretty good um sort of new
AI news and they're posting really
regularly. I mean this is 4 hours ago 6
hours ago. Okay. So they post like twice
a day. Yeah, three times a day. Four
times a day. Four times a day. Um, which
is great because now we have a lot of
news, a lot of content to then
repurpose. So the input is this. So
we're going to put input uh in this case
post
from evolving AI. That's for Instagram.
We put a note here Instagram IG. Now the
next step after this is actually
extracting the text from the post. So
this is called scraping. We want to go
here to let's say this post right here
every single week and we want to take
this whole text and this is what we're
going to use to then repurpose which
means that we're going to change the
tone of voice but the message is the
same. So the overall information is the
same and we're going to make it our own
content. So the next step here is
scraping
post text. [music] Now for us to
actually scrape the post text from
Instagram we would use a platform called
Apify. So, Apify is I mean the way that
I have it represented is just the Amazon
for scrapers. The Amazon for all of
these things that a smart dude in the
world created using code. Uh but of
course we're not using any code. We're
just using it automatically using our no
code platform end to end. Um so if I go
to go to console, you have to make an
account and [music] you go to API store
on the bottom you get to see that you
have usage which is $5 because API
actually gives you $5 for free every
single month that you can use. And so
let's go to an example here. We can see
this is in the back example. Let me go
here. Yeah, that [music]
we have the scraper. So this is the
thing that we use to actually scrape.
And I'll I mean if this looks
complicated, don't worry. I'll break it
down. And we have to use $150 or we have
to pay $150 for,000 leads. So, if we get
$5 for free and we have to pay 150 4,000
leads and this changes every single
scraper depends on what they are, then
do the math there and it should be
around 4,000 leads if I'm right. The
math dudes in the comments, let me know.
But that's how much you have to pay. So,
ideally, what I would do is I would go
to the API store. Again, it's like
you're looking for a product on Amazon
and the product that I want is a product
that is able to scrape IG posts. Okay?
So, I want to split scrape uh or let's
just do Instagram
post scraper. And we have two options.
[music]
Instagram post scraper and aify.
Instagram post scraper. So, aify is the
actual platform name. So, typically I
would go for something that's aify based
because again it's a platform. [music]
50,000. I think that's pretty good. And
$2.70,000 post. That's a bit steep, but
I think it's fine. Uh I mean, we're not
going to scrape a,000 post. I think
we're going to do maybe 50 a week. So,
it's basically free because we get $5 a
month. And this is what the the sort of
UI looks like. So, on the top we have
the name of the scraper. Then we have
the description. Then we have the input.
So, there's two different ways that you
can run the scraper that you can
actually use this. You can either go in
the platform and run it here. So, run
the um start the actual scraper [music]
or you can use the JSON, you can connect
API to end and [music] then be able to
run it automatically within the no code
platform. And if that made no sense to
you, no worries. I'll explain exactly
what it is step by step, so don't worry.
Um, but we can see here that the inputs
are uh, well, there's really only one.
There's one input, [music] which is
either an Instagram username, a profile
URL, or a post URL. So, if I go to what
was it? Evolve AI, I think. Yeah, there
we go. Evolving AI. If I go here on the
top is a URL, and this is the post URL
or the profile URL that I get to paste
here, right? And this is the I mean the
thing I already had pasted but it's the
input that we have that we give API
saying hey here's a profile URL just
scrape these posts on this time frame
this many posts for this many post in
this time frame it says extract post
that are newer than date so the input
that has to go here is the URL of the of
the actual account which you can change
with your own URLs if you want then the
number of posts that we make or that we
scrape and then we scrape um we're only
scraping the posts that are newer than
this [music] date right here. So again,
you can run this. If I press start, what
this will basically do is it will now
say it's running right here. And over
time, it will start giving me results.
So results are just basically here.
Here's the output. As you can see here,
the actor is getting your data. All
right. So we're already seeing some
outputs come up. These are the different
uh text posts that we ideally want to be
able to then repurpose using our tone
voice. We'll name the post URL,
which comes from here. So this is the
text that it extracted and we get a
bunch of them, which is great. All
right. So I mean ideally you would have
to run this. Let me abort which means
that you stop the automation. Well it
doesn't really mean that in real life
but in the automation context it is but
now we stop the scraper and we said hey
stop scraping but now we have the
different text post that we would like
to use. So we know this works cuz we get
the output. So all right cool [music]
scraping IG post using Apify. And then
the next step would be using AI to check
if it's relevant [music]
cuz it's great that we get all this AI
news, but are they actually relevant to
who we're targeting and who our audience
is? Um, so in this case, we use AI.
Well, we can say chat GBT, but I think
that's fine. And then we ideally want to
rewrite
the post
using our tone of voice. and then we
would add it to a Google sheet. Now,
this right here, this automation, we
ideally want to run it every single
week. So, the first step actually is run
automation weekly on a Monday. So, we
have fresh new ideas that we can post.
So, run automation weekly on a Monday.
Post uh from involving AI, which is an
account on Instagram. Scrape IG post
using API. Use AI to check if it's
relevant.
Uh and then we rewrite the post using
our tone of voice and add it to the
Google sheet. So in this case the output
is a Google sheet full of content. All
right we can get to building now. All
right let's go to end and the first step
that we have to do is let me just do a
trigger manually which means that just
to test but later on we're going to
replace this with a on schedule which we
run every single week. Uh so we do
trigger manually right here. So the
first step is to scrape IG post using
API. So how do we do this? Well, we have
to connect API to end. I can go here to
API and I have this node and I can now
run an actor because again these are all
different actors that we have within the
actual platform. This is an actor. So I
can run an actor and then in order for
us to connect API, we have to go to
create a new credential. We have to go
to API key. I believe that the API key
you can find on settings. Yeah, API
integrations and then you can copy this
right here. If not, you have to create a
new token and I think when you're new to
API uh then you paste it right here.
Let's do 100 million connection and
press save and we're good to go. Then
the resource is actor because we're
running an actor. The operation so what
is the action that we're doing in this
case is running an actor and then the
actor source recently used actors is
fine. Now, one important thing here is
that if you go to the actors, so again
went to Instagram, we can also go to
runs because we already run this
already. Apify, Instagram. Yeah, this
one right here. Aify Instagram post
scraper.
In order for us to see it here, in order
for us to have it in our list of
scrapers, we already have to run this in
a platform. So, if you don't see it
here, it's because you need to press
start and save and it will start the
automation. It will start the actual
actor. You have to run it once in order
for then for you to see it right here,
which in this case is uh Instagram post
scraper aify Instagram post scraper.
Cool. So now it's asking us for the
input JSON. So the input JSON is
essentially what is the thing that we're
feeding to the scraper saying, hey, do
this and then give us the data back.
Well, in this case, we can either do it
manually or we can use JSON like I
mentioned. So for us to use JSON, all we
have to do is copy this whole thing and
we delete this and paste it right here.
So I'm basically saying, hey, I'm
running it automatically. I'm using the
JSON that we have to use. And that's it.
And now what we're going to do is we're
going to be changing the date. So first
I'm going to run this just to get some
test data. You can wait for finish. This
means that we're waiting for the scraper
to be done. Let me execute step.
We go here. I can see that on the runs
now this is running. This is starting
the scroller which means that it's
starting to scrape.
But what I was thinking here is because
this is saying, hey, only get the post
newer than this date. We want the date
to be dynamic. We want it to be the date
that we're running it minus [music] 7
days from the last week. So we only want
to run post from the last seven week.
Are we finished? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Cool. Okay. So we got the data. In this
case, we didn't actually get the post,
but we got something called a default
data set ID. Now, Apify, the way it
works is that we run the actor, and then
we don't actually get the post there. We
have to give it to another node in API
which is called the get data set [music]
items. Yeah, right here.
And this node right here will be the one
with the same connection that we then do
a data set get items and paste the data
set ID that we have from here which in
this case we can get from here default
data set ID. So drag it across. This
will be the thing that we use to then
extract the data. So if I remove the
limit, I think you can remove it. Yeah.
Yeah. I can pin this, [music] which
means I don't have to rerun this again
in order to to do the whole thing. I can
now execute the step and this will now
give me the post. So the caption for all
the different items that we have and
this is a long long list.
Uh yeah, we can see it in schema, we can
see it in JSON, in table as well. All
right, now that we got the data, now we
can move on to the next steps. And by
the way, all we did is run this run the
actor sent it here to then get the data.
So all the different post text that we
want for the next steps and that's it.
Uh let me go here to mro. This right
here [music] is good.
This right here is also good. And now we
have to use AI to check if it's actually
relevant. So the next step right here is
to add another node. In this case is an
AI step. We're not using an AI agent.
We're using an AI step which in this
case I think OpenAI is I think pretty
good at this. We can now message a
model. In order to connect your OpenAI,
you have to create a new credential. You
have to go to platform.openai.com.
You have to go to dashboard. Go to API
keys. Make a new secret key. Name it
whatever you want. You will have a code.
And you will then paste back here as an
API key and press save. Now bear in mind
this is not free. Like all of this is
not free. You have to pay for API tokens
which you can find in your profile
billing and then put some money here. I
think $5 is more than enough. It I mean
it lasted me 6 months so I think it will
last you hopefully. um unless you're
completely bombarded with with different
scrapers but that should be fine. Now
once you have this connected the
resource is text the operation so what
is the action that we're doing in this
case it's message a model the model that
we want to use is mini 4.1 mini because
I'm going for quality and speed which is
fine so again for prompt we have a
system prompt which is you are a helpful
intelligent xyz assistant and paste this
I go here full screen you can see the
whole prompt you're helpful intelligent
precise Instagram post classifier for an
AI focused audience people who build
with or want to learn AI uh understand
cool news that come out of it and that
actually strike and have an interesting
take. I think this is a pretty good
overall. I mean, you would have to
change this with your audience and who
you're targeting. Um, and then for the
second message, we use a user message.
For the user message, I'm going to paste
this. If I go here, zoom in, I can say,
hey, classify the Instagram post for an
automation focused audience. Return only
verdict relevant or not relevant. It's
relevant if it's something interesting
news on AI that come up. not relevant if
it's a motivational, personal, non
motivation, coding, crypto, politics,
finance, or tool discounts or vague hype
with no build/impact.
And then we want to output this as JSON.
Now, what why do we use JSON here is
because we only want the output to be
either one of these items. We wanted to
say relevant or not relevant, right? And
we toggle this on. Output content is
JSON because then we're basically
saying, hey, I told you to do is JSON.
Now, I'm telling the system that the
only output that it can do is JSON.
That's fine. Uh now we have to write the
actual data that we're giving the um the
AI which in this case is the caption. If
I go here I'm basically saying hey here
is the Instagram post to analyze. It
gave me an output but it's because I ran
it when I shouldn't have run it. Uh and
now I can drag this across
and have this as a caption. So the
caption is basically the text of the
post.
Let me execute this step again. So this
is now running.
And now it should give me like an
accurate answer as well. And let me
rename this while [music] it classify
God. Classify relevance.
Rename. Did it run? No, I didn't run.
Cuz I renamed it. All right. Well, now
it's running. And I actually forgot to
put one step in the middle because
ideally we're doing 20 items now because
in here [music] we're telling it, hey,
only get 20 items. And we can put this
to 100. Whatever it is. Let's put it to
100 cuz that's more realistic. Um I mean
they post four times a day. What is it?
Four times a day. Let's do 30 actually.
Or 50. Let's do 50. Yeah, we don't want
to send all 50 here. Maybe we want to
send 20 at a time. And now we can see
that we start to get the different
outputs. So not relevant, not relevant,
relevant, not relevant, relevant, not
relevant, not relevant, relevant. So
it's good because it's not giving us all
the information that's relevant. It's
only uh filtering out the ones that we
actually care about based on our
audience. So in order for us to actually
not send 20 at a time and we can do we
can batch it. So instead of because I
put 50 here when we run this now it will
give us 50 posts. I don't want to send
all 50 post through. I want to basically
loop over it. So which means that we
send only 20 through. Then at the end of
the automation we bring it all back and
we do another 20 and do another 10 until
it's finished. So in order to do that we
have to use the loop robot items.
This is saying, so we connect this to
this. By the way, you can delete this
and delete this. You're basically
saying, hey, after this, [music]
loop over only 20 items. So, I only want
to send 20 posts through at a time. And
the next step is here. And then at the
end, the last step of the automation, we
bring it all back to here. So, it takes
the ones that are remaining. Now, one
thing I also forgot to put here is the
date. [music] So, if I go here inside,
so now I can manipulate the data. So
here [music]
um ideally it's telling us hey this post
have to be newer than a date. Well in
this case I want [music] it to be the
date that is running minus 7 days. The
way to do that is to put square brackets
put now I believe dot
minus
7. Let's see if I got this right. days.
No it's giving us the actual text. We
don't want that. So in this case what I
would do well actually I can do
format. I think that works. Yeah I think
that works. So we're formatting the
date. I mean first of all we're
minusing. So now now is today then we're
removing or we're subtracting 7 days
from now. So last week the past week and
we're formatting it as y mm dd which
uppers this as this. So let's try this
out. I mean could or could not work. So
we'll see. We only the only way to know
is to actually test. So, let me unpin
this and let me execute the step. Okay,
cool. It worked. Cuz if it didn't work,
it would give us an error. Perfect.
Okay, cool. All right, [music] we know
this works. Let me stop the automation
and let me uh yeah, pin this. It's fine.
And now, after we classify the
relevance, which in this case, [music]
this step. Now, we want to be able to
rewrite the post using our tone of
voice. So, first step before we even go
there, we have to set different
variables because I want to extract the
variables that I actually care about
from the data set items because there's
so many variables. I mean this
overwhelms me. Ideally I want to get um
the like count, comment count, views
count and some other stuff as well. So
in order to do that I can go to edit
fields.
I can then go to I think I have to run
this. Yeah, I think I have to run
[music] this. Maybe not. Let me try
this.
There we go. Little hack. Um, and now I
can put the
comment count.
Let me actually one quick hack. Instead
of [music] you putting the name, you can
just drag it across and it'll put the
name itself. And then I think it's like
views if I'm not mistaken. View. Yeah,
video view count. Put it here. And then
I think it's likes likes count. And then
I think that is pretty much it. So likes
count, comment count, views count, and a
full text. and date posted. Yeah. So,
full text and date posted. The full text
in this case will be the caption and the
date posted will be the time stamp here.
Yeah, this one. I think it should be
this one. Yeah. Yeah, it is this one.
But I don't want it in this way. So,
later on, we're going to change it. But
it's fine. So, for now, we can set we
can actually leave this here. So, we can
set the variables and then go to the
next step. And this will make more sense
once I once I actually show you later.
But essentially why I'm doing this is
because later on when I want to pull
information here from the let me run
this from here I don't have to go all
the way into here and then start finding
information I can just simply go here
and find the things that I need right so
in this case the caption we can leave
this as is but I feel like I want this
here caption
and I think this is fine. The next step
is in your automation to be able to then
filter filter based on the ones that are
relevant. Some are relevant, some are
not relevant. So I'm going to put a
filter here. You simply have to press
filter.
And the verdict has to be equal to
relevant.
So the filter is saying, hey, only let
the ones that are relevant to the next
steps. So if I if I pin this and again
amazing feature and then
I run this now I see that out of 20 only
12 went through which means that only 12
were accepted and were actually
relevant. Once it's done now we can uh
send it to an AI in this case Claude
because Claude is better at making
content be able to rewrite the post
using our tone of voice. If I go here
bot anthropic in this case we can
generate no messenger model which again
you can find I don't think you could
find it
anthropic down below there messenger
model and [music] you go inside and now
to connect your collad you have to go to
get the API key you can go to anthropic
console to console.anthropic on public
dashboard and then get the API key. You
can create a key, name it whatever you
want and also make sure to add money
into your billing because it's not free
but again just like OpenAI this is very
very cheap. All right, cool. So now we
can go back to Nen and we can paste the
API key. We can connect it. The text
will be text operation will be messenger
model. The [music] operation which is
what is the action we're doing again
message model. The list we can actually
use. I think 3.5 hey is good. Let me
actually go to CH. That's good. Which
model is good [music] or is best for
content? I mean this is realistic what I
would do if I didn't really know and not
will tell me. It depends.
No, not complex. Yeah, 3.5 Sonnet. So,
we can use Sonnet 3.5 Sonnet. Yeah, it's
fine. And now we have to put the prompt.
Now, for the sake of time, I'm not going
to write the prompt from scratch. I'm
going to paste the one I had before, but
it's fine because you get to have the
system for free. And I'll show you
exactly how to get it. So, don't worry.
Um, now this has the overview, which is
you are helpful intelligent writing
assistant. And now that I think of it,
this should probably be a system prompt
because as [music] I mentioned, the
system prompt is the prompt where you
tell it, well, that's why. Okay. All
right. Take my words away. Uh there's no
system prompt option. So, we just leave
it in the user prompt and you are a
helpful intelligent writing assistant.
The task is to rewrite the Instagram
post that I'm going to give you in a way
that encapsulates uh encapsulates the
original theme but uses different words.
I'm targeting an audience that are
people who build [music] with or want to
learn AI and they are always fascinated
by new discoveries or news that actually
make an impact. My results over the last
year I've generated six figures, worked
with over 40 businesses and taught
17,000 people and I got to do a bunch of
fun stuff like travel, enjoy my life,
etc. Rules use a no fluff young tone
when rerunning the Instagram post only
up the Instagram post and that's it.
Perfect. Now on a uh technical level,
the prompt right here where we use
hashtag this is called markdown
formatting. Markdown formatting you know
when you go to docs right and you type
something when you write an essay you
have the title which in this case is
heading one. So title, let me have
heading two. Let me have heading three,
right? Let me have heading four. And I
believe text, right? And so the same
thing one one of this
I believe that it's a title. Yeah. Then
this right here is heading two.
This right here is heading three. And
same thing with heading four as well. So
this is why we add markdown formatting
in our prompts because then AI can
basically it knows the hierarchy of the
actual prompts. So it looks so it knows
to look at the overview first the task
and then my results and rules as well.
All right. Uh and now we can add another
user prompt I believe which is the IG
post because we wanted to give it the
post to actually rewrite and say hey
here is the IG post to rewrite. I can go
I think yeah it's here edit fields and
put a caption drag it across and a good
thing is that we actually get to see the
output before it's even run which is
great um okay cool so this is good
simplify output is good now we can run
this press this now this should run so
[music] again we only send 12 items yeah
12 items we're we're ready to go okay
cool in the meantime let me make a
Google sheet which is a database where
we actually get to store all the
content. And I believe I want the
username,
repost URL,
the original post text, and the
rewritten
post text. Okay, cool. Make this white
[music]
this middle. Let me freeze up to row
one. We're good to go. Let me make this
a bit larger. So now it's going to be a
bit bigger than that. If I go back here,
I actually see that this is not over cuz
it does take a while cuz cloud is
timeconuming. But now it's finished. We
have right here. Yo, this is actually
insane. Apple just dropped a game
changer. Your AirPods Pro can actually
now be your personal translator. Just
tap both stems and boom, it picked up
your foreign language. Custom noise. I
didn't know I could do that. All right.
And now we bring it all back to the
sheet. So this right here, it's all
good. And look at how I'm actually
structuring the automation. So I mapped
it out. And then every time that I
finish something, I go here to green
[music] cuz I'm iter. It's called
iterative testing. So we test every
single step to make sure that it's good.
And then we want to make sure some sort
of confirmation checklist that we can
then um say yes, it's good before going
to the next step. So the next step here
is adding everything to the Google
sheet. Let me rename this IG. Again, not
ideal. Let me do IG. And then here, let
me do Google Sheets. I can append a row
in a sheet. Append row just means add a
row. To connect your Google Sheets, you
have to go here and sign in with Google.
[music] It's just a simple page. You can
just choose your account and so on. Um,
that's fine. Once you're done with this,
you can do sheet within document append
row because this is the action that
we're doing. The document will be IG GG.
Choose the right account. Yeah, there we
go. The sheet will be sheet one, which
is this one right here. And now we want
to be able to map all the fields. So
mapping just means that we want the
username to be somewhere from here. We
drag it across post URL, original post,
and rewritten post as well. So the
username I believe we can find I mean
what was his name? Evolving AI. Yeah,
there we go. Owner full name. I can get
across. Now why do we actually want this
is because what if we change the URL of
another person later on. We still want
to know exactly where the post came from
and then we want the post URL. Post URL.
There we go.
This right?
Yep. It's good. Uh and now the original
postex is I can get from the man if any
beginner actually used end for the first
time [music] I get so confused here.
There's so much to so much to look at.
Then the caption is this. It's good. And
now the messenger model which is the
text the rewritten post. I like how we
just translated it in our own tone of
voice. Yo this is actually insane to
this is wild. [music] I like that Apple
just dropped the game changer. All
right. Cool. Um, all right. We can test
this as always. We can pin this, I
think. Yeah, we're good. So, now we
should see this. It's going to be
formatted weird or not. Yeah, it's
[music] good. Uh, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to make this smaller.
So, we get to see the username, the post
URL.
Perfect. The original post and [music]
then rewritten post. I like all of this
apart from this. Yeah, like this. I
mean, this is obviously not us, right?
Yeah, this is not us. So let me go to AI
edit rules.
Do not use any CTA at the end. Not the
best change in prompt, but it's fine.
[music] We're going to run it from
scratch um again. So don't worry. But
now that we're finished with this, so we
said, hey, okay, we run this actor, we
got the data, we set the fields cuz it's
easier for us to actually map later on.
I mean, this should work when it's
running. Um then we said okay we maybe
we can get 50 posts but I only want to
run 20 posts at a time. So [music] we
run 20 post here classify the relevance
if it's relevant then we go to actually
make the post then we add it to the
sheet and then we go back here and we
[music] run the next 20 and the next 20
until it's finished. Well in this case
it's 50, right? So it will run twice and
then it will run three times on a third
it only get 10 finish. So let me unpin
all this. There we go. Let me save this.
Let me refresh the page. And now I
should be able to run this. Yeah.
Yeah. Execute workflow. I can now wait.
If I go to the post scraper, I can see
that this is now running. And this
usually takes about 24 seconds. It can
be a minute depending on how many
results you want. 46 seconds. Yeah, it
depends. You can start to see the posts
that are being scraped right now. And we
only get the data. Okay. Oh, it's 19 19
posts. Okay, cool. We get the data when
it's finished. So, it goes here. Now,
it's going to classify the relevance.
Let me check in here. Yeah, that's good.
I guess it only found 20 post uh from
the last seven days, which is fine cuz
we did put a time frame, right? It's
going to rewrite them and then put them
into the IG GG database. [music] Now,
the reason why we we give it like, hey,
you can script 50 posts, but in the past
7 days, they only had 20. So,
>> [music]
>> uh it didn't find 50. We can see here
that the content is now being added to
the Google Sheets. So if I go here,
I can see that more content has been
added.
I mean this is 24 [music]
and we made 11.
So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11. So these 11
are the ones that have just been added,
right? Which is great. And we have more
content. As you can see, there's no CTA
changed it compared to this. There is a
CTA.
So we made that change. Perfect. Um, all
right. Now, only thing we have to change
for this automation is that we have to
run this every week. I can delete this.
Now, I can go here on a schedule. I can
say weeks, one week. We can trigger this
on a Sunday at midnight. Just Oh,
actually, no. I said Monday. Let's do
Monday. Uh, Monday at 6:00 [music] a.m.
Yeah. Just who wakes up before then. Um,
and then press save. And now you should
have a working automation that runs
every week. It will script the different
post. It will get the data set items. It
will then send the nodes or set the
variables. [music] It will then only run
20 at a time. It will classify whether
this is actually relevant for our target
audience. It would only send the ones
through that are actually relevant. It
will then rewrite them. So, let me
rename this to rewrite
post
before adding them to our Google Sheets
database with all the content right
here.
Hey, I'm about to build a live Twitter
paraset system right in front of you.
that scrapes tweets from top performing
posts on Twitter based on a keyword that
we give it, rewrites them in your tone
of voice using AI and turns them into a
stream of content that you can post
automatically. All right, so I'm just
going to run it and show you exactly the
outcome that we get. We have a form
where we can add a keyword. So in this
case, let's just put AI agents going to
submit. This now starts the automation.
It calls a scraper on Apify. So it can
scrape the top 100 tweets on Twitter
based on that specific keyword that we
give it. If we go here, we can see that
this is running.
It's got 80 so far.
So you can see now it went to the wait
because we're waiting 5 seconds before
adding it to the next API node to get
all the data to then add to the first AI
step which will classify the relevance
of the tweet whether it's it's actually
good for us to actually post it or
whether it could be considered a good
content idea. And we're only letting 50
items through at one time because we
want to make sure that we don't give all
the AI all context and all 217 tweets.
This now sends only the relevant uh
tweets now to the other agent or to the
other AI step which will rewrite it in
our tone of voice before adding it to
the Google sheet. All right. If you go
here to our Google sheet, we can see
that we have the AI agent keyword, the
original post, so the original tweet and
the rewritten tweet [music] that we take
in order for us to then be able to post
it to our platform. All right, so let's
dive in. I'm going to go to a new
workflow.
Workflow personal right here. And we
start from zero. Now theory, I would
have to go to Miro, which is a platform
where we actually map out the automation
before actually building it. We're going
to start strategizing behind what is it
that we want. Right now, initially, a
paraset system is using someone else's
content to be able to repurpose it for
our own. And so because we're talking
about Twitter, Twitter operates with
keywords, as in like you give a keyword
and you can get a bunch of tweets. So
the input has to be a keyword right the
input is a keyword that's the input now
the keyword can be can be a form can be
a button can be a message it can be
different things um we can sorry we can
give the input in different different
ways a form a message whatever it is an
email but in this case because we have
notion uh sorry nitn forms integrated
within n andn we can use the form right
here actually let me just put nitn form
here and this will be the keyword that
will be like the only question that will
be asked now After we have the form uh
with the NN keyword, we would be able we
should send it to a scraper. In this
case, we use APFI. And I'll talk about
which one's the best, how we actually
find them and all sort of stuff. Uh but
in this case, we so scraper
scrapes
tweets
based on keyword. Scrape tweets.
Actually, just put scrape tweets based
on keyword. Let's make bigger. And now
we want to be able to send it to an AI
because not all tweets that come from
that keyword are relevant to what we do.
So use AI to check if to check relevance
and then if it's relevant, we want to
rewrite it. Okay, rewrite
relevance
tweets.
Okay, so that's exactly how it's going
to go. And then we're going to be adding
it to a Google sheet. Then on form
script tweets based on keyword that we
have using the form. Then we use AI to
check the relevance. Then we rewrite the
relevant tweets. Uh so this will be a
filter in here. There'll be a filter
whether it's actually relevant or not.
And then we can rewrite it and then add
it to a Google sheet. Okay. I think
that's pretty pretty it's pretty
standard pretty easy. Um the first step
here is N form. So let me actually make
that on NN. And again this is step by
step so you'll see everything. The first
step right here I can press add. I can
go here and now I can have different
options. In this case, it will be on
form submission because we're using the
N andN form right right here. So if I
press this, I will have this page. Now
again, N&N end forms, we have a test
URL, we have production URL. The test
URL is something that we use when we're
actually testing the automation. But
once this button right here is turned
on, where we actually activate the
automation, so we don't have to keep
executing a workflow every time
manually,
uh we will be using production URL. But
in this case, let's leave it here cuz
we're testing. Authentication, we'll
leave it. Uh we don't need any password.
Authentication is sort of saying, do you
want a password to your form? We don't
need it. Uh the form title can be
Twitter
parasite system. Yeah, there you go. Uh
I don't know, for some reason I always
put the Y instead of the I. And then
here you can add
please add a keyword to activate
this system.
And now we can so this will be the form
description as in what you'll see on the
form. And now we can add we can start
adding the questions. So we if we add
add form element this just means add a
question. Uh the field name will be
keyword. It will be a text and
placeholder. Let's just put an example
AI automation.
Okay. And this will be an example thing
that they see before they even write it
to get an idea of what they have to put.
And we put required. Then it's asking us
respond when form is submitted. Yes.
Because you want the trigger. We want to
send information there when the form is
submitted. And that's it. Uh so let me
execute the step. Let me test this out.
Let me do AI agents. I submit. And now
here I should be able to see the output
and it's green. All good. And the
keyword is AI agents. Tells me the date
the form mode which is in test mode,
right? Because we're using the test URL.
Uh so that's good. [music] So that's the
first step done. Now we get on to the
next step which is the Apify. So scrape
tweets based on keywords. Uh let me
delete this. We'll go to Apify from
scratch. I go to apify.com which is a
platform where it's sort of like a
Amazon and the thing the products that
you're buying are scrapers. Okay. And
scraper and the Amazon products someone
makes them you just use them. Okay. So
in this case that's exactly what this
is. People make scrapers you just use
them to do whatever. Uh and it's all
code in the back end right? Again we
don't want to use code. So that's why we
use SL assistant. Um, so typically when
it comes to to scraping, like the first
thing you do is go here and search up
the thing that you want to do. In this
case, it's Twitter scraping.
What's there? Usually I would look at
the reviews. Like that's the first thing
I would look at. Reviews, reviews,
reviews, and the ratings. And then I
would go out and look for the price. Now
because I already did this um I have on
home this this scraper right here which
is if you want to if you want the actual
thing just copy this X data/ Twitter X
scraper you can copy this you can go
here aify store you can paste it and you
will have this one right here. Okay so
this is the one that we're going to use
because of the fact that it's actually
very cheap. So Apify actually gives us
$5 to anybody who signs up every month.
Okay and we have 8 GB. This is more than
enough to be using this scraper which is
35 cents per thousand tweets. If we
scrape a 100 tweets per keyword we have
to do and that's that's what that's very
that's not even not like that's not
something to even mention right in terms
of price. So it's basically free. Um so
you can use it as much as you want.
Obviously again not infinite right
because we still have 35 cents for,000
tweets we have $5. So with that being
said, um we have basically the scraper
tells us that the input in this case can
either be a start URL. It can be a URL
of a tweet or whatever it is. It can be
a search term which is a keyword or it
can be a Twitter handle. Okay, in this
case we want to be able to add a keyword
because that's the thing that we're
inputting, which is why we add So if I
press X, I can add here. Let me do AI
automation, whatever it is. And for you
to actually see it on end, you have to
actually start and run it once, right?
To save. So I already did this so I
don't have to do this again, but you can
start and then save it. And then maximum
number of items output. That's good. All
right. So let me go to NN and actually
cuz I have the scraper already. I'm
going to go to API
right here and I'm going to run an actor
because the actor is the scrapers like
the scraper itself is gonna actor. Uh so
if I press run on actor it gives me the
option to um to actually connect api to
end. I press there I can now put the API
key which I can find when I go to
settings I go to API integrations and
this will be the one here default API
token. I copy this and I go out here and
I paste it. this. So now let me put 100
connection
100 connection

Press save. This will now save. So you
can see here you can't see it cuz I'm
there but uh it will be credential
successfully created. If I go here now I
will have the connection. Okay. The
resource will be actor. The operation
will be run an actor because that's the
action that we're doing.
Actor we can be uh actor source recently
used actors. You should do API store
actors in case you haven't used it yet.
From the list now you will have a list
of actors that you've probably used. If
you this is the first time you will see
none of them. Um but you I mean you will
see the one that you just you just ran
which is the one that I we just spoke
about which is the one here. So this is
the one that you have to use. Look for
the handle X data Twitter scraper or
look for the name XCOM uh X.com Twitter
API scraper. If I go here I can then
look the thing right and it tells us the
name. So we know that it's this one. I'm
going to press this. And now it's asking
me for a few things. It's asking me
what's the input JSON. So how do you
know the input JSON? Well, you can
actually scrape on API using two
different ways. You can scrape on the
platform. So you can go here and
actually put the keyword and run it and
get the results manually and download as
a CSV or whatever it is or you can
actually use it automatically. Use it
automatically. You need the JSON here.
So this is the manual process. In in
case you want to use JSON, we have to
press this button right here. And now it
gives us the JSON that we can copy,
right? And the only thing we have to
change in this case is a search term,
[music] which is the variable that we
get from the form that we fill out.
Okay? So if we copy this whole thing, we
go here, we paste it back.
Uh, okay. So if you do this, we just
copy it. And now the only thing we have
to change here because the search term
is the thing that's dynamic, we have to
change the search term which we get from
the keyword. So if I delete this and I
pull this across keyword in the middle
right make sure that it is in the middle
make sure that is uh that is not here
make sure that it is in the middle
between the two quotes. So this will do
is this variable right here will be
changed. Okay, it will be dynamic will
be something that changes as the form
submissions change. So what I do here we
created the actor we connected the
actor. We said okay this actor is fine.
Then I went to API said okay if this is
the manual way of doing things with
these with these settings a automation
100 and so on top the JSON for it is
this top a automation 100 and so on.
Right? So you want to copy this, you
want to paste it here. And then the only
thing you want to replace is the actual
keyword that you use u to actually
script the tweets. And that's asking us
for um wait for finish. In this case,
yes, we want to wait for finish. What
this means is that we can if we toggle
this off, we can basically send the data
to the the actor, but it will run. It
will say it's successful as in like it
won't give us the the data back. It will
just run it. But if you press wait for
finish, what it will do is that it will
send the information to the actor like
this. It will wait for the actor which
in this case can take 45 seconds to
finish and then it will give us the
data. Okay. So in this case that's
exactly what we want. Uh timeout we
don't need timeout. Memory is fine.
That's fine. So let me actually test
this. Uh in this case I can press
execute step I believe. Yeah. So what
this will do is it will go here. You see
how now it's running. So it's running a
new search term uh based on the keyword
AI agents which we just ran before.
Again executes that. The good thing
about NNN is that you can actually test
it using the data from the previous
steps. So now it's waiting. So we're
we're actually waiting for the data to
come back. We script 60 so far and now I
believe we have to wait at 20 more
seconds for it to to load. Um but this
right here is is basically what's
happening. It's giving us a whole log of
the whole of everything that's happening
within the actual platform and how it
scrapes. All right, cool. So it's
finished. If I go here, I can see that I
get different data, but we don't
actually get like you can see we don't
actually get the tweets. What we get is
a bunch of fields. And the thing that
you really have to care about is this
right here, default data set ID. Because
this right here is the thing that we're
going to feed into the next node, Apify,
for us to actually extract the
information. If I copy this code and I
go here and I put another API node, API,
in this case, it can be get data set
items. So, let me I mean, I actually
just find it there. We are right here.
Get data set items. So if I go to get a
get data set items, what this means is
that the only thing that we have to feed
it is the data set ID. So if I paste
this manually in this case it will have
to be automatic. If I execute the step
now this will give me all the data just
50 items 50 tweets for that specific
keyword where we can that we can go
through. I go in table I can see that
it's a bunch of data and it's divided
into pages. This is how we get the data
from API. This actor runs we wait for it
to finish. Then we get the data set ID
which we feed into the second node which
will get all the data from that data set
ID. And then we can go out and uh and
use it for whatever. Now the limit we
can leave to 500.
So if I go to execute step now we see
179. It was 50 because that's a limit.
Um or that was the limit. Data ID with
that's the thing we have to replace. So
in this case you can go here to default
data set ID and you want to drag it
across here and the connection is the
same. the resources data set operation
is get items uh offset limits and that's
all good. All right. So now that we have
the data we can go to the next step. So
if I go here to miro uh the next step is
to use AI to check the relevance.
There's only one problem here is that
we're sending 179 items to the AI step
which you can't do because sometimes it
can't overload which means it's too much
information and will not run. It will
error out. Uh, so [music] in this case,
in order for us to actually be able to
send, let's say, 50 and then 50 again
and then 50 again until it finishes, we
have to use a loop over items. So I go
loop
over items.
And now it's asking me for a batch size.
So batch size is saying, okay, what is
that number? How many items do you want
to send through before we loop back and
get another? Right? So in this case, we
can do 50 and leave everything else as
is. So in theory now, it will get 179 or
whatever it is it needs to get. It will
send it. It will only send 50 through
based on here. And then it will go back
50 again. 50 again until it finishes.
Okay. So I'm going to delete this. Let
me delete this. And now I can start
adding the next steps of the automation.
So in this case again is the AI to check
the relevance. So we can go here loop to
AI. You can go to OpenAI message a model
because we're messaging a model. And now
in order for us to connect our OpenAI to
uh NN we have to go here to create a new
credential. We have to get the API key.
Now the API key is something it's sort
of like a password that says hey and
then you have access to my account you
can talk to it you can talk to the GPTs
whatever it is you have to do
automatically in order for us to get the
API key we have to go to here to
platform the openi.com
we can go to uh you have to sign in of
course go to dashboard go to API keys on
the left hand side you can create a new
secret key on the top right uh name it
whatever you want we can do and then
workflow when you create a secret key
this now will be the API key that you
will use when you have to go back to end
and paste it here. Okay. Now, make sure
you don't share this API key with anyone
because it is um it is something that if
someone else has access to it, they will
start spamming your money. Um so, don't
do it. So, copy this, bring it back
here, paste it, and then you will have
the connection sorted. Now, once this is
done, you'll have the connection here.
The resource is text. The operation will
be message a model. The operation is
sort of saying what is it that we're
doing. Uh and then from the list, the
models, we can just use let's do 40
latest. I think that's fine. or four or
mini. I think four or mini is 4. Yeah,
4.1 mini. That's like we're looking for
something that's like quality plus
speed, right? Um so 4.1 mini. That's
fine. All right. So we have the prompt
right here, which is in this case a
system prompt because again we give it
an identity. Uh if I go in here, let me
just zoom in and you say you are helpful
precise tweet classifier for an
automation focused audience. uh people
who build or learn automations and then
make.com Zapier uh APIs and web hooks,
AI agents, RPA workflow ops, integration
patterns, real build tool releases that
impact automation work. Now, this will
obviously be replaced with whatever
you're doing. Um so you can change this
to to your kind of audience. Uh but for
me, it's AI automation. And now I'm
going to start adding the user and
assistant. So for the user, I'm going to
add a prompt that allows it to say user
uh to say whether this is relevant or
not. So again system is for you are a
helpful intelligent XYZ. So it knows
it's that thing. So if it thinks it's
that thing is going the output quality
is going to get better uh because you
gave it an identity. And now for the
user prompt we say hey classify a tweet
for an automation focused audience
return only verdict uh relevant or not
relevant. So this is using JSON we're
saying hey only output this. This is the
key. This is the value relevant or not
relevant. um based on these rules.
Relevant if it contains actual
automation content, how-tos, real
builds, API, web hook, interpretations,
agent, RPA workflows, templates or ops
patterns because in this case we only
want things that are actually relevant
to what we do and then not relevant if
it's genetic AI tech news, motivational,
personal, no automation coding, uh
politics, finance or tool discounts or
vague hype with no build impact. And we
only tell it to output JSON only. Okay,
because that's the only variable that we
want. We don't really care about
anything else. We just want to say hey
is this relevant or is this not
relevant? Uh once this is done now we
can give it the tweet. Um so if I add
another user message so in this case I
have to I believe I have to run the
previous steps. Yeah I have to run
previous steps for me to see here I have
to execute previous nodes. In this case
it's running. So we have to wait about
40 seconds but then we'll be able to pin
the data and then we can we don't have
to rerun everything again. All right. So
it just finished running. Um I mean now
we're using AI but we have the variables
on the left hand side we can use to
actually add it here. I'm just going to
stop this. There we go. Okay. Now all we
have to add is this. So we added you are
a helpful intelligent or um whatever
assistant and the prompt is you need to
check whether the actual tweet is
relevant or not. U but now we have to
give it the tweet. So last user message
will be here's the tweet that you need
to classify.
And now we have to find the tweet here.
So if I go to not loop over items, it
will be get a data set items for sure
because that's where the data is all at.
If I scroll, something you have to do
with these sort of things. There's so
many fields. Most of them don't matter.
Okay. Okay. Yeah, it's definitely
description. Description. That's the
closest thing that looks like a tweet.
Yeah, description. So now we can drag
this across.
Not loop of Adams. This one right here.
We [music] can drag this across. Make
sure it's API
right here. And now this will be the
thing that will be used to actually
check whether it's relevant or not. So
here we can rename this to relevance
agent. Although it's not really an
agent, right? Cuz it's just a step. It's
an AI step. All right, cool. So once we
do this, now we can um
we can go to the next step which in this
case is actually filtering. Okay, so we
want to actually run this because
we want to make sure that we have the
data to test. Uh, but I actually forgot
to do one thing. So, this agent is going
to run, but I forgot to do one thing,
which is turn this on. Uh, output
content is JSON because we tell it, hey,
output this as JSON. So, we have to turn
this on to let it know the output is
JSON. That's all it is. Uh, so now what
it's doing is it's uh running through
50.
So, I mean, we still get the data and
I'll show you exactly what it looks
like. U, but now it's running through
all the prompts. is checking every
single person or every single Twitter um
post that's made and that's the thing
we're going to use to go into the next
steps. All right. So, you can see now uh
it's null. There's no data.
So, now we have to turn this on. Output
content as JSON. And let's rerun it
again. Let's execute the step again.
Now, it will take the data from these
steps. And now it will run it again to
make sure that we can now actually test
the data or test the step to make sure
that we we have the correct things. All
right. Cool. So now that it's finished,
I can see here schema.
Okay, why did it error out? Why did it
not work as we expected it to? Okay,
this is part of the process. So let's
see. I think it might be because of it's
not actually the author description,
it's the text. So let me just press text
here and let's see what I get.
It should be full. Okay, that's why.
Okay, full text. I think that might be
it. Yeah. Yeah, I think that full text
is the full text of the Twitter post.
So, let me execute the step again. And
again, this is part of the process. I
mean, we we mess up. We have to see we
have to check the variables, not check
the variables, see what works, see what
doesn't work. Um, and if I didn't show
this part of the process, I'd be lying
cuz that's always what we go through
when we build automations. I'm just
going to wait again until it finishes.
All right, cool. So, now if I go in
here, I can see that now we have
relevant, not relevant, and so on. Now,
the next step here is to add a filter
because we're asking to give us the
relevant and not relevant so that we can
filter out the ones that are not
relevant and only send the ones that
are. So in this case to add a filter we
just press plus and put filter
remove items matching a condition. This
case the filter would be if the verdict
is equal to relevant then we send only
those one through. That's it. That's
what we're doing. So if I run this
believe that it will do it.
Yes. Should do it or run it. Oh it's
going to run it again. Okay. I forgot to
pin the data. Okay. I should have pin
the data. So they don't have to run it
again for always always remember to pin
the data cuz then you see how now to
rerun this to only run the step I have
to start everything again and I have to
wait like 40 seconds. Um so lesson
learned uh we're going to pin the data
in the next uh in the next round. All
right so it just finished and you see
how of the 50 that went through only 27
stayed. Only 27 were relevant. Now let
me pin this data. I can drag it across
and press B. So now if I wanted to test
this again, I would just um have this
finished. And now to get on to the next
steps, uh we have to go to the rewrite
relevant tweet. Okay, we're still going
to use an AI, but in this case, we're
not using OpenAI, we're using Claude.
Now the reason why we're using Claude is
because Claude is extensively better at
writing content. Okay. So if I go here
and I write claude anthropic
I can go to generate a prompt.
Zoom out. Now to connect your claude to
the uh NNN we have to go here create a
new credential. You have to get the API
key. So we can go to anthropic console
um get the API key. Create a key right
here. You can name it whatever you want
and then you can add and you'll get the
API key. Once that's done you bring it
back and you will paste it here. All
right. So now that you pasted and now
you connected your API key to claude,
the resource is text. We're going to
message a model. The list uh let's do
3.5. Hu. That's fine.
I think that is one of the best at
writing content. Or is it sonnet? Okay,
let's just do in this case. I think it's
like the fastest. It takes the most
context uh the most amount of words. Uh,
and the prompt in this case, let me just
copy it from the automation I made
before is the one here
says, "Overview, your helpful,
intelligent writing assistant. Uh,
rewrite the tweet that I'm going to give
you in in a way that encapsulates your
original theme, but uses different
words." So, that's what parasite just
means. We're taking something and
rewriting it in our own words. I'm
targeting this audience. My results uh
are this. So, I worked with over
generated just under six figures, worked
over 40 businesses, and taught over
17,000 people, and I got to do a bunch
of fun stuff like travel, enjoy my life,
etc. The rules is use no fluff young
tongue when rewriting the tweet because
that's me young. Um and then only upload
the tweet and that's it. That's a pretty
standard prompt. That's a pretty good
prompt. It has overview. It has task and
it has my results. Now what you see here
is hashtags. Hashtags are in MAC.
They're used for markdown formatting. So
this right here means it's heading one.
This right here is heading two. Heading
two. Heading one. Okay. We do this
because that way the GPT knows what's
the title and it can it can basically
categorize or has the hierarchy to what
to look at first. All right. All right.
So now that this is done, we can now
prompt the same model to uh we have to
give it the tweet essentially for it to
actually do something. So we can add a
message user. In this case, we can say
here is the tweet
to rewrite
rewire. Rewrite. All right. And now we
can pull the tweet from
uh was it full text? Yeah, full text.
There you go.
All right. So now that this is done, we
can I believe test. Yeah, we can test.
Let me actually let me pin this
as well. This as well.
So I don't want any problems having to
run everything. Uh let's uh let's
execute the step. So now it's actually
running.
This is running. Taking the data from
here and from here. And it's going to
give us an output which you then need.
All right. In the meantime, uh once we
finish this, we have to make a Google
sheet. Okay, so let's make the Google
sheet right now. Let's go to sheet new.
Let me copy the headers that I had
before. Keywords, original post, and
rewritten post because again, we want
the I mean that what I wanted here when
I actually thought of the system was the
keyword. I want to see exactly what uh
where the comment came from the keyword,
the original post. So in this case, it
will be the original tweet, rewritten
tweet.
Okay, that's fine. All right. So you can
see this is taking a bit long but that's
fine because it is taking I mean it is
clawed and it's 27 items as well to
rewrite something. So that's uh that's
normal. So now let's rename the sheet to
Twitter
Twitter system because I already name
this parasite system Twitter system. The
sheet is one. Uh let's put this to new
tweets ideas. And now, okay, we have the
output here, which in this case is
rewritten uh rewritten tweets that we
can use. And now we want to store
everything in a Google sheet. So I'm
going to go here, press plus sheet,
Google sheet, add a row. So append a
row. Append just means add. And now you
have to connect your Google sheets. You
have to go here, create a new
credential. You can sign in with Google.
It will take you to a page. You can just
press the account. In this case, this is
my account. Press okay. Successful means
all good. You can go back to N. Name
this cal connection and then the date.
Press save. That's fine. The
connection's made. Now we want to do a
sheet within a document. We want to
append a row. Again, operation just
means what's the action that we're
doing. And the document is Twitter
system.
Twitter system. Cool. And the sheet is
new tweet ideas.
We're going to leave this as map each
column manually because this is the
manual step. want to basically map the
variables to the columns so that they
change and they add every single time.
In this case, the keyword is or can I
find the keyword somewhere here? No, I
think we have to run this. Yeah. Yeah,
we have to run this.
Execute step.
Okay. Wait, let me get the let me get
the link. Execute step.
AI agents.
Now I have this. I can pin this.
So that here I think now we'll have
access. Okay, I think I need to rerun.
Oh, not here. Here.
Yeah, I'm going to have to rerun all the
steps in order to get the data. That's
fine.
That is okay. That is okay. It happens
cuz I definitely need to get better at
pinning data and making sure the data is
not we don't have to rerun the whole
thing and we can have previous steps
pinned so we can use it for the next
steps
and alerting process here. So that's
fine. Okay. So this is done. When this
is done, we have to pin this. Uh we'll
be able to access this variable right
here, I believe.
And then we can add everything to the
sheet. All right, cool. So now it uh it
ran successfully. Let me pin this as
well. And here uh at least one value has
to be added. Yeah, that's fine cuz we
didn't add any keywords. Uh here I
should be able to see the keyword.
Perfect. Original tweet. This is the
text. So full text.
Let me do something actually because I
keep after looking at this. Let me just
put a set
set variables node. Like I'll show you
exactly what it is, but um let's do
keyword. It just makes it so I don't
have to go back to here and and find
everything. But if I put keyword here
and I put uh get data set items, I put
text. This is like the tweet original
tweet
and this is re
written tweet.
I can go to claude
and get this.
Now if I go here to to Google sheets,
let me run this. Using the item method
does not work when painted in this
scenario. Please unp get this time and
try [music] again. Okay, so we're in a
bad position again. That's fine. Let me
just do AI agents and then I can change
this later.
Let me just start this
pill filter.
Okay, cool. Then this runs. Okay, I just
wanted the data here so I can I can just
send it here. Okay, now you see how I
don't have to go back and forth in the
form. Find it here. Find it here. Find
it here. I already have it here.
Keyword, original tweet, and rewritten
post or tweet. Okay, so it's much easier
for me to uh to actually use it. And now
if I go here, I need to send this back
to the keyword. Okay, I don't know what
I did. I don't know why I did that.
There you go. It's here.
Keyword. So that's fine. Because again,
we're mapping it from from the previous
steps.
And lastly, I'm just going to run
everything from scratch to see how
everything works. And one more thing we
have to do is this right here. When it
finishes, we have to get back
uh here.
to make sure that we get the rest that
are finished because we have 100 uh 215
only 50 go through all this. We want to
go all the way back to get another 50
until it finishes. So, let me unpin
this.
Let me unpin this. I'm just pressing P,
hovering over it, pressing P. Now, we're
going to start the whole thing from
scratch. Let me reload.
Let me get this whole thing good. Let me
execute workflow. Let me do
MCP.
Um, yeah, I think I think it's fine. I
think it's pretty it's a pretty hot
topic right now. So, submit. We can go
here. So, now it's running the actor.
So, if I go to Apify,
I can go to running and I can see here
that is running, which is great to see.
I guess most most of the times when
you're building automations, things
don't go your way and things don't work.
But it's about figuring it out. That
that's how you really become the system
architect. uh when things don't go your
way, you just build, you iterate, you
just get better. And now we can see all
of this is running, which is great. Um
how many recorders did it get? Okay, we
got 97 so far. All right, now it went to
get the data set atoms, it then sent it
to the first AI step to check the
relevance of the agent. And again, as
you can see here, only 50 went through.
And also, if you're asking what the done
is, this just means once everything is
looped and everything's fine, what is
the [music] thing we do? In this case,
if you leave it blank, nothing will
happen. Uh but you can maybe send an
email to yourself saying, "Hey, uh we
just finished looping through all the
items." In this case, we don't it's not
really necessary, so we don't have to do
it. All right, so it's good. Out of 50,
only 27 went through. Now we're using
claw to rewrite the post, which will
take about 40 seconds uh before we'd add
everything to the sheet. All right, so
now it finished, and now it's going to
the Google sheet. Now it's going back to
get the other 50. So I can see here that
I mean it is a bit messed up. So if I go
here and I actually format it, I can see
that now the keyword is MCP. This is the
original tweets. This is the rewritten
tweets. Now I can use this for whatever
it is I have to use, right? Which I have
a stream of content ideas just come
through based on the top tweets based on
that topic in uh in Twitter that I can
use.
Hey, I'm about to show you an AI system
that I built that scripts YouTube
comments from any video and turns them
into fresh high converting video ideas
posing real feedback from your audience
or even your competitors so you can see
exactly what people want, what they're
confused by, and what they're asking for
next. All right. So, this right here is
a full edit and automation that I built.
Uh, and by the way, if you want the free
resource, the whole template you can
download for your account. All you have
to do is go to my free school community,
go to classroom, go to templates vault,
and right here you'll see the latest
video that I posted with the resource
that you can download. And if you're
unsure as to how to import it onto your
account, there's also a tutorial right
here that I made, which is important to
end. All right, with that being said,
let's dive in. So, the automation itself
is is a workflow. So this is not an AI
agent and there's a very specific reason
for that and we'll talk about that in
just a second. But it's separated into
six different steps. The first step is
list of YouTube channels. So we have a
list of YouTube channels in a channel
ID. So we have a channel ID from each
channel. From each channel we took the
15 posts that are most recent from their
feed. We scrape comments from those
posts, the most recent ones. Then we
check with AI if it's relevant to what
we do and who we help and who we serve.
Uh if it's relevant, it makes a title
for that idea or comment. a YouTube
title, a video idea that could happen
based on that comment. Then based on if
it's relevant, we also generated a hook
and an outline and we store everything
in notion, which is where we store
everything for YouTube ideas and so on
that we can then use to actually draft
it and post it and so on. All right,
cool. So the way it's going to work, I'm
going to run this. Um, so typically you
would have this running every month, but
I'm going to add a manual trigger. So
I'm going to go here, other ways trigger
manually right here. Connect it.
So I want to see I want to show you
exactly how it works and how it looks
and everything around it and then we can
go into step by step how it actually uh
works and all the settings and stuff.
All right. So I'm going to execute
workflow which starts the workflow from
the start. It ran over here. We script
the YouTube channels. Now it's using
Apify which is an external software to
be able to scrape. Scrape just means
extract comments from those videos. It
is going to take a while just because
it's 14 items. So it's 14 uh videos that
it has to scrape right for each each
time. As you can see right here, the
actor is running. So the automation is
running. So we have to wait until we get
the actual uh result back from here.
Okay. Then once it's done, which took
about a minute or two, uh it goes to the
wait because we're waiting until we get
the results back from API. And I'll
explain exactly what that means. And
then once we get the actual items and
the results, we in this case we have 505
comments. These 505 comments will go to
the first agent. So in this case, it's
an AI step. It's not really an agent
that checks whether it's relevant. if
it's relevant, it makes the title for
our video and then sends it through here
to be able to then make the hook and the
outline, right? Uh in this case, we're
only passing 50 items at the time, which
is why we're using the loop over items,
which means that out of 500, it doesn't
send all 500 at the same time, it sends
50, right? And then we do 50 again and
50 again until it's done, right? Um to
make sure that we don't we don't time
out, we don't get we don't exceed exceed
the token limit, which is something that
happens with AI when you add way too
much text or way too much information.
Okay, now that it's done, it only passes
through the ones that are valid. In this
case, it's only seven. So from those
seven, we generate the hook and the
outline to then send it to notion which
is where we add we store everything
right here. As you can see, the topics
are being added right now where we have
the content idea, we have the hook and
we have the outline, right? So let's
take an example. So we have how to
automate meta ads inside and manage
unlimited videos. Then here I have the
hook. So based on this idea, we have I
helped over 40 businesses automate their
AI and referrals. Uh today I'm going to
show you how to automate meta ads inside
of manage. So this is a very simple
hook. It follows a very specific
framework that I use uh which is
credibility and then talking about what
we're doing. And then we also have the
outline right here, which is basically
giving you a structured outline for the
video that you can't make uh from 1 to
8, which is great because when we're
filming YouTube videos, it's sometimes
it's hard uh to think through an outline
or you take some time to think through
how you can position the video, how what
you can talk about from step by step. Um
instead of just going on the camera and
just just speaking out of nothing,
right? Um so that's exactly where we're
going the outline as well. And now what
it's doing is that it's going back here.
It's then doing the whole process again
until all the 505 comments are being
passed through. Okay, in this case only
100 went through and as you can see more
and more being added to notion, more and
more come. So you just have a stream of
video ideas that you can use for your
channel which is awesome especially for
I'm on YouTube game so I'm I always do
YouTube and that's what I that's what I
do right now. Um so this is awesome. I'm
using this myself to be able to [music]
just figure out what people want, what
people don't want. I feel like you don't
really run out of ideas in the AI space,
but it's still good to know what people
want, what people are struggling with,
um the sort of problems that they want
solved, the sort of videos that you can
make based on feedback from other
videos, uh other comments that they put
on videos, right? Which is such an
underrated strategy. So, as you can see
now, I have a list of topics, and again,
this is running until it's finished,
until all the 500 items are finished.
So, I'm just going to skip to the part
where it's done. So, because it will
take about 5 to 10 minutes, I'm going to
stop the automation.
So it'll take too long. Uh but as you
can see now what it would do literally
was based on this one channel. So only
one channel went through. It took all
their videos. It scripted all the
comments from those videos. It sends it
through here to check the relevance if
it was relevant to us what we want and
what we do and who we serve. Then it
make the hook and the outline. Then it
sends it to our database. And then it
goes back here to get through all the
comments. And then once that comment is
done, at least all the comments are
done, then it goes back and does the
second channel and the third channel or
how many channels you put. So, it's a
whole repetitive loop that you don't
have to really do nothing apart from
adding the channels there. And you can
run this every month and this just runs
automatically. Um, and you just have a
content ideas to just have here with the
hook and with the outline. You can then
obviously review, approve or or reject,
right? Whatever you want. Okay, cool.
So, I'm going to save this. I'm going to
refresh. Um, we can go through step by
step how I actually built this. This is,
I would say, one of the more complex
automations, but it actually is very
simple once you break it down step by
step. and go through the logic of what
you have to do when you're building. So
again, the first step would typically be
uh an on-time trigger typically every
single month because you're only
scraping 15 videos and 15 videos is
typically what someone uploads every
month if they're on it, right? Um which
a lot of YouTubers are, which is great.
So we get to pull comments from their
videos or even our videos, right? This
can work for our videos or their videos.
So on time trigger would be the first
thing. So we would have with this really
on a schedule. So the schedule will be
once a month and then the the first step
here is to like the logic here is to
have a list of YouTube channels that you
can then run through each one and then
go through go through the whole flow,
right? Um so this node right here is for
us to actually set the channels. So when
you want to set the channels
um you don't necessarily you don't have
the you don't have to put the link to
the channel. You add the channel ID,
right? Which is what we're adding here.
And I explain exactly what this is um
what an array is and all that sort of
stuff. But when you go to YouTube, let's
say I go to Alexa Mosi, right? Alexer
Mosi right here on the URL, he has
subscriptions and he has this long code.
So I can if I just pull everything in, I
go to my so I can show you exactly where
the ID comes from. Okay, the ID. So we
have the fixed part which is where this
one and then we have the ID which is
this. So we would need the ID for each
channel to be able to actually scrape
the channel. Okay. So when you go to the
YouTube um and you want to use a channel
for this in this case you would just
copy this or I mean copy only this part
right which is the ID of the channel and
then you would add it here. So the
channel [snorts] ID now the reason why
we are and these are three different
channel ids of different competitors
that I have in the space and the reason
why [snorts] I have this as an array is
because when you want to run three
different things at three different
times you need it to be in an array and
then split it out. Split it out just
means that it takes an array which is a
list of different items inside here. For
example, let me show you. It will give
you three different things. So, schema,
channel ID zero, channel ID 1, channel
ID 2, and then take each one
individually and start running the
automation. It will split it out, start
running the automation uh individually,
right? It'll go through the first one,
then we'll go back second one, go back,
third one, right? Um, so again, we have
this, which is channel IDs, which is I
just added channel IDs of my competitors
that I can go through every single time.
If I wanted to add or remove, I can just
simply remove this or add. Right? In
this case, if I wanted to add Alex or
Moszi, all I have to do is go here
bracket channel
ID and then with a small L
and then you add the the code
and now this is pretty much set. Now
these right here are called key value
pairs. This is a key and this is a
value. Okay, the key is channel ID,
which is the same for each one. And the
value is what is the actual thing. Yeah,
you need a space. There you go. Okay,
cool. So, that's how you do it. Um, and
this is JSON. So, the JSON has an array.
And that's sort of the the technical
part to this. But if you just had an
array, you have three different things.
You can then split it out. So, the next
thing again is splitting it out. So, we
have the array. The array itself, it
doesn't run through each one
individually. It doesn't run through
them cuz the array only has one thing,
which is channel IDs. In this case, we
want one, two, and three. Right? If I go
here, execute step. Now, we can see that
we have three items. So on the table,
you can see that we go through the first
one, then we go to the second one, and
then we go through the third one. Okay?
So now we're able to actually run the
automation one first, second, and then
third. Okay. So what are we doing here?
The settings here are basically channel
ID because that's the variable that
we're using. In this case, channel ID,
which is the one here. Channel ID,
channel ID. It's all the same, right?
Which is why we're able to split it out.
Include no other fields. We just want
this which is where we take these and
then take one individually run it second
individually run it and third
individually run it. Okay, so that's why
we do it. Now the reason why we're using
this loop items is because um Natively
runs three of them at the same time,
right? Obviously in three different
things, but it runs three of them at the
same time. We don't want that. We we
want to run each one individually. So to
be able to only run one at a time, we
have to use loop over items so that we
can run this and then at the end when it
does everything, it goes back. So that's
what this is. It goes back to here and
runs the second one. So when we add
batch size, which means how many items
do you want to let through? In this
case, it would just be one. We have
three. You can see here three items, but
we just want one, which is why we put
one here. Uh once we did this, we can
then edit field. So this in this case,
we just have the channel ID. This is not
necessary, but I just wanted to extract
the channel ID so I can so I can have
it. Um, let me execute the notes right
here. And now I can just drag this
across and put it here. So I have the
channel ID to then feed in to the next
step, which is where we actually scrape
the videos. U, but this is something
that's not necessary. You can just
simply add this to the next step. I just
wanted to have something that's more
clean. So channel ID right here, which
is just mapping field.
And now we go to the list of top 15
videos that we have to scrape. Now, in
order for us to scrape something, we
typically would use Apify. So, let me go
here. Apeify, which is basically a
platform where people make their own
scrapers. So, they code scrapers. They
do the hard part. We do the easy part,
which is just using it, right? And the
good thing about Apify is that we um
it's actually free. So, not necessarily
free because we still have to pay. But
if I go here to the one that I actually
used before, and I'll explain exactly
what this is. We can see that for this
scraper to scrape 1,000 results, which
in this case is 1,000 comments, we have
to pay 40 cents. Okay? And we're
basically scraping about 20 comments, 20
30 comments per video. Uh, so we're
paying nothing really. And we have $5
for free from Apify. So if you do the
math there, you're basically paying
nothing. So that's why we use Apify
here. But for the YouTube videos, we
also can use something called an RSS
feed. Now the RSS feed is basically a
way for you to tell the web like hey
using this URL go out and scrape go out
and find um the YouTube videos that we
can use. Now in order for us to set up
the RSS feed we can go here RSS feed and
then we go to this page right here and
then we have to add a URL. So the URL is
something that is fixed. The only thing
that changes is the channel ID. So we go
through here within channel ID 1 we
script all the videos. Channel ID two
script all the videos. Channel three
until we finish all the videos. Now, how
do we know this URL? How does this
happen? Well, if I just go to Google and
I search up um RSS
feed YouTube channels, I can see that if
I I usually go to Reddit or you can see
here as well that you can use this. So,
https w youtube. So, this is just a
format
for the YouTube videos. If I go here, I
can see that this follows a very
specific format. It follows the
https.youtube.com
feed subscriptions and then the code.
Right? In this case, it would be this.
uh it wouldn't be subscriptions. Yeah,
it would be feed. So you go here, you
copy this, you would paste it here,
right? And then the only thing you have
to change is this part right here,
channel ID here, which is where we pull
in the variable from the previous step
to here. That's exactly what I did. So
in this case, if we execute the step, we
can see that now we I think this is next
arrive. Yeah, next arrive. We um we
scraped the videos from Nick's arrive
and we have 15 of them. So 15 items
means that we have 15 videos and this
only scrapes the top 15 videos. If you
wanted to scrape more, you could use
Apify um to scrape a list of 100. But I
feel like for the most recent ones are
good because they are the most recent
ones. So they're on top of they're on
top of like the the most recent ones,
which is great to scrape. Uh which is
exactly what we want. So here you can
see the 15 videos, right? Why automation
beginners should start this platform and
all this sort of stuff. So that's what
we want to see and that's what this does
essentially and if you change the
channel ID you change the videos that
you're scraping. So it's very very easy
and you can see we just ask Google and
it give us the URL. Okay, if I go here
then what we want to do is and this is
comes from testing a lot of the videos
that people post not a lot of them but
some of them are shorts they're not long
form videos. So we want to be able to
filter based on whether it's a long form
video or a short form video. So if I go
here, I can see that the link. So the
link right here. Yeah, the link right
here. If it's a short, it will say it's
a short. It will add the the name of
shorts here. Okay. And this will tell us
that it is a short. Now you can't see it
here because this is a long form video.
But if it was a short, I think it would
say https youtube.com watch I think
shorts something. Uh and that tell us
that it is a short. Okay, you can't see
it here just because this is a long form
video. But bear in mind that we're just
saying, hey, don't let any shorts
through. I just want long form videos
because they're more validated like
that's what they're actually posting and
usually shorts are just a way for people
to repurpose their long form videos and
then bring them to which is exactly what
we do right so okay so JSON link we're
saying hey let me drag this across if
the JSON link does not contain shorts
then send it through okay so there are
cases let me go here so see how 14 items
went through is because let me go here
and show you I think there there has to
be a short here because only 14 went
through there we
So you see how on this URL Y uh Y
saturation doesn't matter. This is a
short and if I go here
I can see
>> just cuz something
>> this is a short from next arrive right
and this
comparison is a long form video.
So we basically don't want any shorts we
want the long form videos. So and the
only difference between each one is that
the short comp contains shorts here. All
right, so the filter is done and then we
go through the apify. So third step is
scrape 100 comments from the videos. So
if you go to apify and you go to actors.
So again, apeify is a way for us to be
able to scrape. Scrape just means
extract different information from the
web um for the YouTube videos that we're
that we're talking about. We want to
scrape the comments. So typically what I
would do is you would go to actors or
API store, sorry. And you can search for
actors. Actors again are just different
pieces of code, different different
scrapers that you can use to scrape
whatever you want. So if I added YouTube
comments
scraper,
what I would do first is I would look at
payment method because I typically want
the pay on results uh or pay per output,
right? Like 40 cents per thousand
comments because then I have to pay.
Some of them make you have to give it a
subscription for API, which is the ones
that we don't want. But let's say I go
here.
This is two uh $240 for,000 comments.
This is Yeah, this right here is $20 per
month plus usage. So, we typically have
to pay for the scraper. So, we don't
want this. Uh 50 cents for,000 scrapers.
That's fine. And then 25 a month. So, we
definitely don't want this. I found a
scraper. What was this? YouTube comment
scraper. So, grow social grow social
media YouTube comment scraper. So, if I
go here, let me search it up.
Yeah, there we go. I found one that's 40
cents per thousand results. Okay, so
this is right. You just have to copy
this. You can copy grow media YouTube
comment scraper and you'll find this.
This is the cheapest that I found and
gives me the best result, right? And the
thing that we can add to this uh that we
can actually the fields right itself are
the YouTube view URL and the maximum
comments. So what's the video and how
many comments you want to scrape? So if
I go to Apify, if I go here back to NNN,
I can add a run an actor. So run an
actor just means we're giving you the
the actual video go out and scrape,
right? So we scrape it and then so let's
say I go to execute step. What this will
do is it will take the URL from here it
will give it the JSON link and it will
tell you hey maximum comments is 100. So
if I go here to runs now you can see
that it's running and we got 45 comments
so far and these are all the comments
right we can have a lot of comments from
these videos which is exactly what we
want when we are scraping videos and
that's exactly what we have with API.
Now to connect your API account you just
have to go here create a new credential
and then you need an API key. The API
key you can find I believe it's settings
API integrations and you can have yeah
this right here
default API token. You can copy this and
then you can paste it to right here and
you can save it and you have the
connection and then you have to choose
the actor. By the way, you have to save
the actor first. So if I go to actors uh
YouTube, you have to save it. So save
here or start it at least make a test
run to be able to see it here. That's
one of the the things that I struggle
with at the start. You want to run an
actor. That's the action. Recently used
actor. That's fine. Actors here. And
then the input JSON is what we get from
here which is basically saying hey
what's that thing that's going into the
actor. So we put this and now we're
waiting for the feedback or for the
actual output. So if I go here to runs
I can see that this is still running. Um
I believe we got it back or I think okay
I think it's going through all the 14
items. Okay I know why. Let me just stop
this. This will still keep on running.
The reason why it kept on running is
because we go through the 14 items and
it's going through all the 14 videos
which is why it takes quite a bit. Uh it
takes like one to two minutes or two to
three minutes based on um yeah the type
of video it is. Um okay so once we have
that we can add a weight because of the
fact that here the output yeah it isn't
the actual comments we get a database uh
data set ID. So if I go here to save
execution so I can see the previous one
that I had. Okay I went to one that I
that I did yesterday. If I go here, copy
to editor, I can see that this one it
ran. It gave it to API. And as you can
see here, we don't get the actual
comments. So we don't get the comments
anywhere here. There's a bunch of stuff.
What we need is this. What we need is
default data set ID. So default data set
ID is a thing that we then feed into the
next node which is get data set items
which needs the default data set ID. So
what we do here is we go to
the run after. We then look for default
data set ID which is something you have
to do every single time with API. It's
just the way it works. So we drag it
across and this is a thing that is now
going to use to be able to get the
results. And now this is giving us the
comment ID, common text, like count
replies, all that sort of stuff, right?
That we want. Once we get the actual
results, what we want to do now is
because of the fact that we get let's
say 500 comments like you saw before
here, which is the output of the actual
get data set items, we don't want to run
through 500 items all at once. We want
to be able to batch them. So basically
saying just like before, we don't want
to run through all the channels at once.
We want to say, hey, we have 500
comments, but I'm only letting 50
through. And this is where the relevance
and title come in because now we're
using a loop item again, which is where
we're saying, hey, I know we're getting
all these comments, but I only want to
let 50 through. And then you can run it
back and get the others that are left
and do it all and over and over again
until the comments are finished. So loop
items
once this is done is we add it to an
agent. I mean in this case it's not an
agent it's an AI step to connect your um
OpenAI to NN. You have to create a new
credential. API key. You can find it at
platform.open.com
under dashboard API keys. Create a new
secret key. Create it. And then you can
paste it right here. You can save it.
Now once this is done, this will be text
message and model. Uh the model will be
4.1 mini. Uh because I usually use a
mini because it doesn't it can take more
information, right? And because right
now we're giving it 50 comments at once
all at once in the AI it will take a
while to process. Uh and the prompt that
we give it is first assistant prompt
which is a prompt that we get that we
give the AI when we want to say hey you
are a helpful intelligent whatever it is
in this case is you are helpful
intelligent content writing assistant.
So we give it an identity. So the AI
thinks it is that thing and it will the
output will be higher the quality and
then the user prompt will be below is a
YouTube comment for one of the videos.
Your task is to determine if the comment
is relevant and if it includes any
questions, inquiries or suggestions that
we can use w as an [snorts] idea for
future video. Return your output as JSON
and then we can um add a few examples.
So in this case you would have a system
a user prompt and then to give it a few
examples you give it a user and
assistant. Okay. So what this means is
that we give it hey if I give you this
comment this will be the output. Okay.
So the user is me giving it something.
the assistant is what's the output that
you you want to have and I'm giving it
two examples in this case or three yeah
three examples so the first example
would be um is there any reason to use
an AI agent node instead of basic LLM
chain which is an actual comment that
someone put in a video and here it will
be relevant so content idea is AI agent
versus basic LLM node when should you
use each one that could be a solid
content idea or something else this is a
video from Nate uh Nate Herk um someone
said a small request can you please make
a video on a client on boarding. So
these sort of things is exactly what we
want to see, right? So someone's asking
for a client on boarding for N&M
projects, the content idea in this case
would be how to onboard your clients for
N&M projects and this is relevant. But
if someone puts thank you cuz they put
thank yous and you're great and all that
sort of stuff, we don't want to put it
as a as a relevant idea because no idea
here. Okay, so that's what we're doing.
We are giving it a system prompt. So
saying you are helpful, intelligent,
whatever it is. Then here we're saying
hey this is what you have to do and then
we want to be able to add the comment
first. what's the output that that I
want comment output comment output. So
it has three different examples. One
that's relevant, a one that two that are
relevant and one that's irrelevant. So
it knows exactly sort of where to go.
And then this is the comment. So the
last u prompt which is the user prompt
which you can add message here uh will
be the after comment. Yeah. So we're
using JSON here because of the fact that
we want the verdict and we want the uh
content ID as separate variables that we
can then feed in to the filter and the
other steps. Okay, so in this case 502
went through in the filter only 199 went
through based on the 502 based on the
response from the actual uh AI and the
filter in this case it's if the verdict
is relevant so if the variable verdict
is relevant let me add a uh in this case
it would be verdict
relevant
and then content
idea
how to make a NN agent from scratch. I'm
going to pin this and then this is
basically what it's going to see. It's
going to see verdict which is the one
that I put here and then it's going to
see the content ID but in this case
we're saying only if this is relevant
then send it through. Okay. So once this
is done we can now add some fields. So
these are the fields that will be added
to the hook and outline. You can, this
is again is an optional step, but I just
wanted to add fields cuz I like adding
fields to be able to separate
information. Uh, cuz again, we what we
did is we scraped 100 comments. We sent
it to the AI and we said, "Hey, only run
50 at once." The AI checks whether it's
relevant or not. If it's relevant, it
will send it through to the hook and
outline because it's a relevant comment.
It's a relevant idea. Um, we could use
it. Now, we want to generate the hook
and outline, which we did before here.
Hook and outline,
which is why we're using this AI step.
But in order to generate the hook and
the outline, it needs to sort of
understand what we do. So what I added
here is two variables which is social
proof which is basically uh some results
that I have and what I do and some tone
of voice of direction. This is the tone
of voice and direction. And this is what
I feed into my next AI step which is an
AI step that generates the hook and the
outline like I mentioned before. And
this the settings will be the same. The
system prompt will be you are helpful
intelligent content writing assistant.
We can also write intelligent hook and
outline
YouTube hook and outline writing
assistant. That's more contextual to
what we're doing. And then we're saying
your task is to generate high quality
engaging hooks and outlines for content
ideas. You receive a content ID in JSON
and you will return it in the following
format. Hook string outline string. And
then these are the different things that
we give it. So you can see this is the
projected output that we get. And now we
give it a few examples I believe. Yeah,
we give it a few examples. So in this
case the content idea will be build a
rag agent inside of nnnn and the
assistant will be this. Right now we're
giving it the content ID and because we
give it to we told it to give it to us
in JSON which is just a programming
language. Uh it will give us the JSON
language into two different variables.
So it will be hook and it will be
outline. And the string is just
something we we say when we wanted to
say it's just text, right? So we say
give me the hook and text. Give me the
alignment text. Give it an example. And
now you can see red because it's not uh
this is not correct or like this. What
is it? This. Yeah, this is not correct.
But um this would pass through the
content idea again which is something
like this content ID builder rag instead
of and now this will give us the hook
and the outline which we can then send
to another set variables which takes all
the variables and puts them all into one
place. Again, not needed, but I love to
split information so we're more we're
more structured with the way that we do
things. And now once this is done, once
we set the variables, we can send it to
notion um the YouTube comment database
where we have everything here where we
want to see all [snorts] the common
ideas. All you have to do connect notion
is go to here, create a new credential,
and then you can get an internal
integration secret. You should follow
this guide. It will take you through
everything that you need to do. It's a
bit more of a longer process. Um you can
use Google Sheets as much as you can use
notion. I I'm just a notion fanboy so I
love to use notion and in this case it
will be database page because this is a
database right this right here is a page
from the list in this case the database
is called YouTube comment script
database so we can do YouTube comment
script database the title will be what's
the first thing which is this content
idea so it'll be the content idea the
hook will be this the outline will be
this initial comment will be this
because I want to see also what the
initial comment was to make sure that I
know exactly if the AI I've messed up or
not right so we get the hook the outline
and the initial comment If I go here as
well, I can see the initial comment. For
example, what's the average time most
students take to get their first client?
So, how long does it typically take to
get your first client and what
additional investment are needed to be
on the and what investments do you need?
So, you can make a video about uh how do
you get your first client automation
journey with zero dollars up front,
right? And that will solve this sort of
painoint that this person has. Um, so
that's something you could do. So, we
get the comments, we get the hook, and
we get the outline, we put it all into
and the title, we get it we put it all
into notion. And now once this is done,
it will then loop back. So we go here,
loop it back um to here to get the other
comments that are valid. And it'll do it
all and over and over again until it's
finished. And then we wait and then we
send it all the way back here where we
can do the other channels. So it'll go
through the three different channels.
And say you have 10 channels, it will go
through the 10 channels, right? And it
will just run it every single month. Uh
now [snorts] typically I would suggest
that you run this every month or every
week. Uh it depends on the amount of
channels that you have to be honest. Um
but because we're scraping 15 YouTube
videos, we also don't want duplicate
comments, right? Um and we don't want to
give the same content ideas. So think of
a YouTuber, normal YouTuber, they
typically post like what once every 3
days. Uh and in a month, um that's about
10. Yeah, 10 videos. So if [snorts] you
put that in mind, you can run this every
month and 5 days and it will be free,
right? And I mean you would only have to
pay for N andN from the start until the
end which is which is a very good
pricing model that they have. So that
right there is for the way that is set
up or we obviously have the different
steps and make it a structured possible
and when you look at cost and how much
it actually takes to run this API as I
mentioned right here. So let's say we
have 29 results and 1,000 results is 40
40 cents. So do the math there. It's
0.00. It's not even noticeable amount of
money that I have to even mention,
right? So it's not really expensive or
at all. It's free uh because we we get
the $5 free from API that you can use to
be able to run this. And the other
expenses really are the AI, which
because we're using 4.1 Mini, it's
relatively cheap, so there's nothing
really to worry about. I think it would
be a few cents or 0.01 01 um whatever uh
because it's very very cheap like I
mentioned and end so n charges you per
execution which means from the start
until the end so if you're doing it
maybe 10 20 times again this is very
very cheap because you're running it
every month and so on right so this is
very very cost effective when it comes
to an actual system and that's exactly
what we have this for now who can you
actually sell this to well YouTubers
content creation agencies they always
need to done for you especially done for
you YouTube content agencies they need
to always come up with new ideas for
their clients. So if they have a system
that scripts through all the different
comments for their clients and sees it's
actually validated data. It's not just
stuff that they make up because that's
what people are actually asking for,
right? Um so if they have a system like
that, it saves them a bunch of time in
the actual strategy and titles and hooks
and outline, all that sort of stuff that
they can that they have to allocate
right now. Uh so you can save them that
time of actually doing the actual work.
That right there marks the end of the
video where I showed you exactly how I
built an AI system that scrapes YouTube
comments from any videos and turns them
into fresh high converting ideas. And by
the way, if you're looking for all the
blueprints and resources that I'm
talking about in the video, check the
second link down below. You can go to
the classroom section. You can go to the
templates vault and you'll be able to
see the Nitn course right here and all
the different resources that you can
simply download the automation blueprint
for and import it into your own account.
And if you have no clue how to do that,
no worries at all. You can always go to
the welcome here and you have the
tutorial which walks you through exactly
how to do it.
In this video, I'm going to show you
exactly how we automated 95% of our
onboarding process using notion and
endn. All right, so this right here is
exactly what we're building.
Essentially, it's an onboarding system.
Now, the onboarding system starts with
this step right here, which is filling
out an onboarding form. Now, the
onboarding form is filled out whenever
we close the client. So, we're on a
call, we close the client. After the
call, we fill out the onboarding form as
soon as possible, uh, which kicks off
the actual automation until the end.
Now, the onboarding form contains the
name of the client, the website, and
small details or general details about
the client. Then, we're adding it to the
notion client HQ headquarters, which is
exactly how we manage all our clients
internally, all one place, uh, task,
team, meetings, all that sort of stuff.
So, we add the details of the new
client, which we just closed, to our
client HQ, uh, which autopop populates a
client portal. And that's I put it here
just because it's not a an an
automation. It's a notion based
automation. So we have it here. Then we
automatically add four onboarding tasks.
We make the drive folder which is the
drive folder that we're going to use to
store different assets for that client
specifically. We'll create a Slack
channel internally which we will then
manually share access to with the
client. And then we send an onboarding
email to the client which is saying,
"Hey, welcome to the team. Super excited
to have you going. Here's the drive link
that we actually created for you. Uh we
also sent the Slack access. We're going
to send you the Slack access in just a
bit." And yeah, that's pretty much it.
All right. So let's go to NN which is a
platform where we're actually building
automations which is an automation
platform. Essentially it's taking a task
breaking it down automating it step by
step. So we don't have to do it the
automation does it itself. So we all
start with the the onboarding form right
here which is this one right here right
where we have full name, email, company
name and website. Then we have the
client folder. We share the file because
we want it to be accessible to everyone.
We add the company to our database. We
add the contact related to the company
cuz every company has a contact which in
this case is a CEO or whoever it is.
Then we set the onboarding tasks. In
this case there are four. Uh the first
one is audit which is the first step of
our delivery process. Then we have
setting up this access which means
softwares. Then there is start
implementation which is essentially
starting the structure for the system
we're going to build for the client. And
then automation structure which is
layering automations in the bigger
system as well. Uh then we obvious
link. Then we create a slack channel for
that client. Slack is just the way that
agencies talk to clients. uh you can use
WhatsApp, whatever it is, Telegram. Uh
probably not Telegram. I don't think
that's for agencies. Uh but uh but yeah,
we use Slack and then send email
onboarding email to the client with some
different variables. And by the way,
this is templated. So if I go here,
don't get overwhelmed by all of this. Uh
but it's saying so to officially kick
things off with you. I know investing in
a service like this is a big decision
and our job here is to make sure it
feels like the best decision you made
all year. Uh below is your personal
onboarding folder with everything you
need to get started. The link right
here. We also made a Slack channel. Uh
we're thrilled to have you join the JM
team and can't wait to get started.
Cheers, Mikuel. Now this right here is
something that a lot of agencies don't
have, which is touching on the
psychological angle of onboarding. Uh
because not everything is technical, not
everything is folders, drives, all that
sort of stuff. It is still an investment
that a company is making. So you want to
make sure that they don't have buyers
remorse. They don't feel like they have
not made the right decision. Um so let's
actually try this out. Let's see how it
works. So all I have to do now is press
execute workflow, which will essentially
run the automation once. We have to fill
full name, email, company name, and
website. So let's do it and then press
submit. If you go back to our an
automation, it shows that it's running.
All these screen steps just says it's
successful. It's making the different
task which all have due dates as well.
Um one is I think 1 day then 2 days then
3 days and 4 days when the automation is
running. Just finishing up the task
Slack channel and then getting the
email. So now if you go to our notion HQ
where we manage everything from clients,
contacts, tasks, meetings, analytics. If
I go to clients right here, you can see
that we have one media here added to the
canon board which is where we manage all
our clients, all our delivery uh
statuses. And if I go to one media, I
can see that the client portal was
automatically generated. If I go to the
client portal, which is essentially a
place where we manage everything for
clients because this saves the time of
us having to email the clients for
different stuff, having to find
information. We want to keep everything
in one place for every single client,
which is exactly what this is doing. In
this case, if this is sent to complete,
this automatically sends an email to the
client saying, "Hey, the name of the of
the actual task, which is in this case,
the audit, right? The audit is finished.
The next step is software access. The
next step is database building and so
on." So, it goes step by step. So, it's
all automatic as well, the updates to
the clients. So, we don't have to
manually do it. Uh, we can keep software
access here. We can then have databases.
So, in this case, it will be resource
area. We can add any folders and so on.
And then the miro would be the mirror
for the audit because our first step of
the delivery process is actually
auditing what they have and mapping
everything out step by step with the
whole team. So we put this all stuff
here. They have access to this. If I go
back to the client, if I go to task, I
can see that these four tasks were
autopop populated for the specific
client with due dates that are 2 days, 3
days, 4 days in advance depending on
what you want. Uh but this is what we
like to have. You can see the task
progress which is so if I say I put
complete, it shows 25% task progress.
And if you have a bunch of clients here,
you can see all the tasks you've done,
the percentages and so on. So we have
everything in notion right here which is
autopop populated again. And also one
more thing the tasks are stored in
notion as well. So you don't need
another project management tool. You
don't need to store clients another
place, right? Everything is in one place
for notion. So with task is here.
Companies here. If I go here I can see
that the website is stored here. The
address, the email can be stored
separately. If I go to contacts, I can
see that one contact was here which is
the person from the email to with the
with my email as well. We can also add
more fields like phone number, type,
right? RO title, time zone, and so on.
But just for this case, to make it
simple, we just want to leave it like
this. And then if I go back to the email
right here, I can see that I got an
email from JM Solutions saying, "Hey,
Mika, so pound to efficiently kick
things off with you. I know investing in
a service like this is a big decision.
So our job here is to make sure blah
blah blah." And then we have the
onboarding drive folder. If I press
here, this will take me to the drive
folder, which is named with my company
name. So one media onboarding folder in
this case. And this is where we can
store any creatives or anything that
they have, brand assets and so on.
Whatever it is that they have, um, they
can store here in the drive folder. And
the client itself just gets a nice email
sent to them uh, automatically without
the team having to do it themselves. And
if I go to Slack, you can see that we
have the one media channel right here,
which is a channel exactly for that
client specifically where we can store
anything. We can communicate with the
client. Uh, cuz for any agency service
that you have, it's a good way to
communicate with the client itself, not
being on email. uh cuz when you want to
do quick things, it's good to be on
something like this, WhatsApp, whatever
you have works. So this is automatically
generated as well. And that's the full
onboarding process right there. So
again, we all started with a form. We
then put it to notion where we have a
place where we can store everything. We
generated the client portal, which is
something else that a lot of agencies
don't have because they scatter in
different tools to find client
information. In this case, I said, look,
let's put everything in one place in one
portal where we can manage everything
for that client, which is so so good,
especially because it sets the
expectations, but it also increases the
way that the client views you because
you're more professional. you have your
 together basically uh all in one
place. Then we have the onboarding task
as well so the team knows exactly what
to do. They're alerted as well uh so
they can get started on the project. The
drive folders automatically generated
the Slack channels done uh so that
everybody knows exactly that we have a
new client rolling and then the
onboarding email is sent to the client.
Now something like this depending on the
agency really uh it will take around
well anywhere from an hour to days. I've
worked with agencies who take days to do
this uh which is which is utterly
insane. uh when we have this automation
right here that does it in seconds all
by filling out a form. So this is such a
powerful automation. It's high leverage
for the time that you put in. The output
is so so good and it's so so powerful
which is exactly why we recommend it to
all these agencies. And this was all
done using notion right here and then
using NN right here.
Hey about to build a live LinkedIn
outreach system right in front of you.
We start by filling out a form with the
details of who we are targeting. From
there, it actually scripts thousands of
leads from Apollo, pulls in their
LinkedIn URLs, and automatically drops
hyperpersonalized connection messages
that we can plug straight into our
outbound campaigns. Okay, so as always,
I'm going to run it from the start until
the end, and then we're going to go to
actually building it step by step. So,
let me execute the workflow. This will
then bring me to the form right here.
So, let me say I am targeting real
estate agencies in the US. I'm going to
press submit. What this will do is it
will send it to the first AI to generate
a URL which will then add or send to the
scraper to then scrape the leads. Um,
and by leads we mean LinkedIn URL. So we
can see this is running right here
because we're using API. As you can see
here, we're starting to get results and
we get the first name, last name,
LinkedIn URLs in the ID as well. Then we
send it to the next node in order to
extract the details. Then we only send
20 um details of people. We just send 20
people through the first loop and then
we dropped a hyperpersonalized
connection message for that specific
person based on their bio, based on who
they are and so on before adding it to
our Google sheet database which is where
we store everything right here. [music]
So you can see we have the different
first name, last name, the name as well,
the LinkedIn URL, the title, the email
status, the photo URL, and also the
icebreaker that we can um generate based
on their profile. And if I go here, I
can see that we're still running the
system because we let 97 item through
and then we're sending 20 and 20 and 20
until it's actually finished. If I go
here, I can see that we have more and
more leads that are being added. So, I'm
going to stop the workflow right here
cuz you got to see exactly what it is.
By the way, these are just icebreaker.
So, connection messages that you send
[music] to the lead when you want to
connect with them. uh which increases
drastically increases the likelihood of
them connecting back and you being able
to have a conversation with that person
and a being actually personalized. So
let's start from scratch. Let me make a
new workflow right here.
Personal. There we go. Let me start from
zero. But as always, as you guys know,
we're going to be mapping things out
step by step into our Miro. So let's
dive in. All right. So here we can start
mapping things out. Again, an automation
has an input. Let me make this smaller.
We can zoom in. And the output,
right? And in this case, the input
because we want to basically uh we want
the thing to be dynamic. So it changes
every single time. But the input in this
case is who we are targeting. So target
audience.
And then we start thinking about how can
we actually give it the input. Well, as
you saw, we used end to end forms, but
you could also use a telegram message or
Gmail coming through or something else.
So in this case it can be target
audience from
and it's unformed.
Okay. And then make this smaller and
let's put this like this. Cool. Then the
next step is actually scraping the leads
using Apify which is a software that
allows us to scrape leads. And I'll show
you exactly what I mean. And then we
want to be able to generate
personalized
connection message
to that person
and then we want to be able to send it.
So add details to Google sheet database.
Perfect.
[snorts] All right. So we have target
audience from any form. Then we have
scraping the leads using aify. Then we
have generate personalized connection
message um using the the details of
course and then we want to add
everything to our Google sheet database
which is the one right here. So what I
like to do when I make automations is I
actually like to go step by step and
show you exactly my thought process how
I think through building automations um
just so you can see everything you can
see the whole scope. So the first step
here is target audience. So we need a
way for us to be able to give the input.
So as you saw before I used nitin forms.
This is where we go to end and we start
actually building the automation. So I'm
going to add the first step which is in
this case called a trigger. A trigger is
the thing that starts the automation and
we can go to on form submission
right here. And this is where you
basically make a form. Now the form can
in this case it can compile of the
I guess describe your target audience or
describe your audience that you want to
target. So we can name this LinkedIn
lead outreach
trigger.
Description can be insert an audience
for your LinkedIn outreach
campaigns here and then the form
elements which is in this case what are
we actually asking the user to input to
then start the automation. We can add a
field name called describe your audience
in plain English.
And we want to leave this as text.
Yeah. text text area. I actually don't
know the difference between text and
text area. I believe that this is uh
wider text. So it can be uh long form
rather than short text. Uh so leave this
as it is. So we can leave this as is.
And the placeholder can be company name,
company types, sorry,
location, etc. So this is the thing that
they see before actually writing which
gives them some ideas as to what input
they can give. And let's make this
required. So now if I go to execute
step, which means that I'm just testing
the automation, it brings me to this
page where I can see the title, the
description, the um the first question,
and then we can see that we have an area
for us to actually make the text, which
we can Oh, that's why that's cool. Um so
let's do again like we did before, real
estate agencies in the US. I'm going to
press submit.
As you can see, this is a test version
of your form. And here we can see that
we got the results which is this right
here. If you go to schema we can see
that we have it in this way which is
exactly what we need in order to go to
the next step. All right. So once this
is done uh this is good. Let me go here
and make this green again cuz it's all
step by step. We want to be scraping the
leads. So based on the input based on uh
what is it right here? Real estate
agencies in US. We want to be able to
then send it to Apify which is apify.com
which is the one right here. And I like
to think of Apify as the Amazon for
scrapers. So you go here, you basically
choose your product. In this case, it's
a scraper. And for those of you who
don't know what a scraper is, it's
basically saying, let's let's say we do
um Google map scraper. This basically
extracts. So it goes to Google Maps, it
extract the text, it extracts the
location of businesses, the reviews, all
the stuff that we want from that
specific software. And then we can use
it for whatever we want. And for us, for
this automation, we want to be using
Apollo. So, Apollo is another software
that allows us to be able to scrape
LinkedIn profiles based on a specific
criteria. So, it can be um real estate
agencies in the US, which is the one
that we have right here, right? We want
to put this in. And the output, we want
a list of leads. So, for us to be able
to do that, we have to make an account.
And then you'll be able to come to this
page right here. You'll have the API
store. By the way, if you're asking
yourself, is this paid or is this free?
Well, um the script that we're going to
be using today is free depending on how
much you use it. So, the way that API
works is that they give you $5 for free
every single month. And the scraper that
we're going to use is about $1 for a,000
leads. Okay? So, if you use uh $5, that
means you will have 5,000 leads for free
every single month. But anything that
you use above $5, that's something that
you're going to have to pay. Um, okay.
So, once we come to the API store,
again, like an Amazon store, we just
look for a product, and the product is
Apollo Scraper. And then we have
different options. So, how do you know
which one to choose? Well, the first
thing I do is actually look at how many
people used it and the price. This right
here is good. I know Curious Coder is a
guy who makes a lot of Yeah, as you can
see, he's already here as well. But the
one I used is actually this. I used it
because of price, uh, but also because
the amount of people that actually used
it. And the way that this works is you
pay this per event. So, you pay per
event. What this means is that you pay
per usage. And the price is right here.
So, $1 per,000 leads. And you can do up
to 50,000 leads, which is exactly what
we like. Um, and this page right here,
it might look intimidating. It's
actually quite easy to understand. The
only thing you have to understand here
is like what's the input? What is the
thing that I'm giving the scraper in
order for us to get the data back? Well,
in this case, the input is the Apollo
URL. Now, the Apollo URL is a URL. So,
let me show you here. Let me copy this.
Let me paste it. It's a URL that allows
us to basically say, hey, we want this
type of person. Look, person title, uh,
contact email, exclude, catch all, all
this stuff is a criteria for the person
that we want to extract. And this will
now make a list of leads that we can use
for whatever we want. So, so the input
here is the Apollo URL. That's the only
thing that we have to get in order to
give the scraper the thing that it needs
to use to then give us the leads. Well,
in this case, one thing we didn't add
here is the AI that we use to make the
URL because the URL changes based on who
we're targeting. So, in this case, it
can be AI to make
Apollo URL.
That way when we put the target
audience, we give it to AI. AI knows the
framework of that URL and how it usually
works. Um, and I'll show you exactly
what I mean here because it is a very
specific thing. And then we have the URL
which we can then feed into the scraper
on API to then give us the leads back,
give it to AI to make the personalized
connection message. And then we can add
all the details to the Google sheet. All
right. Uh, let me go back here. And now
we can use the next node which is an AI.
So we can go AI. We're not using an AI
agent because we just want the AI step.
Let's use OpenAI. That's fine. And we're
going to use message a model.
And in order for us to be able to
connect our OpenAI to uh NSN, we have to
go to platform.opai.com.
Make an account. Go to dashboard. Go to
API keys on the top right. Create a new
secret key. You can go here, name it
whatever you want. And then test. You
will then have this key right here,
which you can copy and paste it back
here.
API key. And don't worry about any of
this, okay? Okay, the only thing you
have to worry about is the API key. All
right, once you connected your API key,
let me take this off. Um, we can do text
message model. The model that we want to
use is uh let's say GPT5.
GPT5. Let's see if we have that cuz it
is something that we don't want any
errors on. Um,
let's see if we have GPD5 here. Yeah,
let's do chat latest, the latest GPD5
model. And for the prompt, I'm going to
give it a system prompt, which is
basically saying, hey, you are a
identity. You are a helpful intelligent
whatever it is. And then a user prompt.
So
system and I'm going to say you're a
helpful
intelligent
sales assistant. And for the user
prompt, I'm going to paste the prompt
that I had before so you guys can see
it. Uh but again, you can grab the whole
template at the end. I'll show you
exactly how to do it. As you can see
here, it says, "Your task is to take as
input a natural language description of
a prospect audience and turn that into
an Apollo search URL." Now, here's an
example of an Apollo search URL. So, I
gave it a few examples. Not not few,
just an example right here. You can see
it has United States. And this is in a
very very specific order, which Apollo
likes when we want to be able to script
leads. Uh the URL describes a search for
people that are located in the US, hold
the title, owner, CEO, founder, and
partner, have a keyword associated with
creative agency. And these are the
fields that you can change. organization
location, keywords, person titles, and
organization number of employee ranges.
Do not add and change any fields. Use
the above template. Return your response
in JSON using this format. Search all.
Search where all goes here. Okay. So
that way we basically say, hey, this is
what the structure is like. These are
the things you can change. And as the
last input, we're going to give it
another user prompt, which is the target
audience. Okay. So I'm going to say here
is the audience I am targeting.
And by the way, I just dropped it in
from the form. So this is a variable
that I can pull in here and then start
the automation. And that's how
automation fundamentally works cuz it's
all dynamic. It changes every single
time cuz you see here it might look like
code cuz it is code. Uh but it's just a
variable from here. And then lastly, we
have to output the content as JSON
because as you can see here, I I told it
to return your response in JSON because
I just want a variable. So what I'm
going to do now is I'm going to execute
the step which means I'm going to test
this. And as you can see, I got the
search URL which I will then be using to
give to the scraper to then be able to
scrape the leads. So now that this is
done, um, perfect. Let me rename this to
generate
search URL.
The next step is actually using API to
be able to scrape the leads. So I'm
going to go here, look at API. I'm going
to run an actor because again those
different things are actors. They're
scrapers. And then to connect your API,
you have to go to create a new
credential. You need an API key right
here. I believe that you can get your
API key on settings API and integrations
and you can um copy this default API
token and then you can paste it here.
Have the connection and that's it. Once
you connected it, uh which one is it?
Okay, I'm going to bet on this one. This
one right here. Uh the actor is the
thing that we're using. The uh action is
the run an actor and then actor source.
This is fine. Uh very very important
though, if you don't see it here, if you
don't see it in the list, which I do,
which is this one right here, you need
to actually run this once because yours
will say start and save. Once you start
and save, it will run it once. That way
you can actually save it to your
account. So you're able to see it here.
And then the next thing it shows us is
an input JSON. So if when you look at
this, you're like, "What the hell even
is this?" Uh, well, if you go here to
the input, there's two different ways
that we can run scrapers in Appify. We
can either use the platform itself and
just run it and then get the data, or we
can use it automatically within our
automations or Nitn or Makecom or
Zapier, whatever it is, um, to be able
to automatically do it. And so because
we're using Nitn as our automation
software, we have to give a JSON. So
this right here is an input JSON like
the input that we give the scraper which
we can find right here right we can just
copy this
and we can delete this and we can paste
it here okay and the only thing that we
have to change is this because right now
it's fixed if I run this it will always
take this URL but we want to change the
URL based on the URL that we have here
so search URL which we can drop in here
okay so copy this and put it here I
think this always happens
There we go. So [music] now the green
variable is this thing that changes
every single time and all these other
ones are the same apart from max search
result which we can leave to 100 or
actually yeah you can do 100. What this
says is like hey scrape the leads. These
are the maximum amount of leads that I
want you to scrape. Okay. And we do this
because as I mentioned this is paid. So
you basically want to maximize or you
want to limit sorry you want to limit
the amount of leads that you want to
scrape from that scraper. Okay, so now
we have this. Then we want to wait for
finish, which means that we send the
data, we then wait until we get the data
back. And then we can move to the next
steps. So I'm going to execute the step
right here. Let me actually pin this P
and then P. I'm going to run this. So
you can see now this is running. And if
I go to here to runs, I can see that we
have a new run running right here.
And this is fundamentally how you test.
You go to the API platform and then you
go back to inn and so on. So now you can
see that we got a list of leads and I
mentioned the maximum amount of result
that I put was 100. So we're going to
have to wait until we get 100 or we can
just simply stop the automation and just
test. That's how I usually do it. Uh but
let's wait until we get 100 result to
then be able to go through the next
steps. All right. We can see here that
we have 97 results. Uh close to 100. And
if I go to NN at any second now, we
should be able to get the run um or
finish the results of the run. All
right, we got 100. Let me go here and at
any second now we should see the output
that is generated. Cool. So as you can
see this is what we get out of the
scraper. But the one thing about Apify
that most people get confused about is
they start thinking where are the leads
like where do they where do they come?
Well there's an additional step that we
have to do before we actually get the
leads because right here this is running
the actor. Once we finish running the
actor what we get is something called a
default data set ID which you can find
here. default data set ID. This is the
ID that we then give to the next node
which is let me pin this real quick so I
don't have to run this again. The API
uh get data set items right here.
Same connection data set get all items.
And now we give the ID to this node
which is the one below here
to then be able to extract the details
from that output. And I'm going to put
the limit to 500. I'm going to execute
the step. So you can see now we get 100
items which are the 100 leads which is
first name, last name, name, LinkedIn
URL, title, email status, photo URL,
Twitter, we get employment history, we
get a bunch of stuff, employment
history, a bunch of employment history,
we get street address, we get
organization, we get a bunch of stuff.
We get everything about the actual
profile which is amazing. [music] And
once this is done, then we have to go to
the next steps. So let me go here. Let
me make this green. Let me make this
green. The next step is actually
generating a personalized connection
message using AI. [music] Now there's
only one thing in between this and the
AI because when we think about this, if
I just add an AI step, so AI open AI
message model and so on, right? Let me
just configure this later. This will
basically send 100 items all at the same
time to the AI. And if you wanted
something more scalable, ideally you
want to send maybe 20 at first and then
loop back and do another 20 and another
20, another 20 until it's finished
[music] because then you give it space.
You give it time or room to breathe to
then be able to actually generate a
better output or for it not to fail. So
in order for us to be able to send only
20 at a time and then it finishes the
whole thing and then goes back and 20 at
a time, we use something called loop
over items. So if I go to loop over
items right here,
the only thing that this asks you is,
hey, how many items do you want to send
through at a time when in this case we
want to send 20, right? Let me delete
this. So you can go here, delete and
delete. And now using the loop output,
we're going to go here and it's
basically saying, hey, okay, we have 100
atoms. If I run this, it should run or
not. Oh, it shouldn't run. Yeah, cuz
this is just the the actual node. Or it
should run. Then it shows us that out of
100 items, it only sent 20 items
through. So that we have 20 items and
then we use AI to generate the personal
message. We then give it to the Google
Sheets. Then we send it back here and
get the next 20 items and do the whole
thing again until it's actually
finished. And this works for any amount
of items. Even if you have 5,000, it
will always loop back, right? And this
is a cheat code that I like to use
whenever you want to make your
automations more scalable over time.
Because again, adding one more step,
you're not going to pay more because the
Nitn you pay by workflow execution, not
by step. Uh, which is exactly why I like
to use this. So now we want to be able
to generate connection message. Okay,
by going here again, you already
connected your OpenAI on this step. So
you can use the same exact connection.
Let's just use GBT4. Yeah, you can use
this 4.1 mini. I think it's good. um and
the user. So in this case, system prompt
first because we always use a system
prompt to give it an identity to make
itself think that it actually is that
thing and the equality of output would
be better. Um is you are a helpful
intelligent writing assistant. And this
is always how you should structure your
prompts. Always a system prompt first
and then sorry about that. Um and then a
user prompt and then you can do another
user prompt or whatever it is you have
to do. Now for the sake of time, I'm not
going to be writing the prompts from
scratch again. Um, I'm going to paste
them here and then show you exactly why
they're there and how they work. All
right, so I just pasted the prompt.
Let's go through one by one. We have a
system prompt as I wrote before. Then we
have the user prompt, the first one,
which is your task is to take an input
of a bunch of LinkedIn profiles and then
you basically have to return an
icebreaker. So the icebreaker is the
connection message. Um, in order to
ensure the icebreaker punching high
quality, make them follow this template.
So we give it a template that they can
use. Um, and it can say hey name love
seeing thing about them. So you can say
something specific about them. I'm also
into plausible tie-in, which is
something more specific about them. Um,
and then you can say four thing about
them and plausible tie-in. Never use the
extract information provided in LinkedIn
field. Instead, always paraphrase. This
makes it seem more human written and
basically give it a few instructions
that they can use. But this is
essentially the structure that we use.
Okay? And these variables are the thing
that we change every single time that
the AI is smart enough to change um when
we give it the actual data from that
person. The next prompt that we give it
is another user prompt. So now this is
where we start to get two examples. So
this is where we start to use the
assistant prompt. Uh the first thing is
a user and then assistant. So in this
case we're giving it an example because
we wanted to I guess have something in
mind that it can come back to as
expectations of what we expect the
output to be. So we give it an example
in this case LinkedIn fields Danielle um
founder and CEO creative agency uh
regional sales director previous
experiences and then we actually give an
assistant prompt which is the output
that we should expect in JSON which is
hey Danielle love seeing your creative
agency journey I'm also building brands
thought I connect something short and
sweet very very uh personalized and very
human right um which is what we want so
we give it a user and assistant and then
lastly we gave it the actual data that
we want it to use uh to be able to then
make the icebreaker. So, LinkedIn fields
can be first name, the last name, which
we get from here. So, first name, last
name, LinkedIn URL, title, uh I believe
that we have previous experience, so the
company they work for, and there's a
bunch of fields here. Again, if you get
the template, you can copy it like
literally word for word and prompt by
prompt. Um, so you don't have to do this
again, but we give it different fields
as you can see here for it to use to
then make the icebreaker. Okay. So, now
let me pin this. Let me pin this. I
think I can pin this. No, I can't find
this. Um, and let me execute the step.
So, now I'm [music] testing this. All
right. So, the output uh was done. And
as you can see here, I actually messed
up because I forgot to turn this on. So,
you can see here the content that we got
was actual JSON. Well, we don't want the
actual JSON. We want this right here.
Right? So, what we do to fix that is
turn this on. And now if we execute the
step again, what this should do now is
it should actually output the icebreaker
not in JSON but as an actual sentence.
All right. So you can see here we have
the icebreaker uh different from before
because it's not in JSON anymore. It's
an actual like something that we can
actually use. And lastly, this is where
we get to the Google sheet. So this
right here, all good. And now we get to
the Google sheet part. Let's go here.
I'm going press plus Google sheet. Uh
append a row in a sheet.
First of all, make your connection. Just
sign in with Google or yeah, sign in
with Google right here. It will take you
to a page like this. You can choose your
account and then it will come back say
successful and everything's good. Now, I
already made the sheet, but I'm going to
make it again um because I want to show
you exactly what it looks like even
making the sheet. Let's go to sheets
new. Quick hack to make a new Google
sheet. And then, as you can see, we need
different fields. So, if I go here, I
can see that the different fields are
ID, first name, last name, thank URL.
So, ID, first name, last name. Let's do
LinkedIn
URL because I noticed that this was just
a name, the first name as well. Then we
have title, email status. I don't know
if you need this cuz there's no email
that we're getting. So, title, photo,
URL, and icebreaker. Title, photo, URL,
and then connection message.
Let me make this um
dark blue. Make this white. Let me make
it look pretty.
Perfect. Go here. And then quick hack
view. This res up the ro. So if I go
like this, I can still see it. All
right. So now that we have this, I can
do connection
message LinkedIn
and YouTube tutorial. really long name
just so I know exactly what this is. If
I go back here, I can see that now I can
uh resource is the sheet within the
document. Then we want to append a row.
Append just means add and then the
document that we want to use is the
connection message, LinkedIn and then
YouTube tutorial. There we go. Right
here. And the sheet will be sheet one.
We want to map each column manually. And
now this is where we start adding the
different fields. So I can go to ID.
Yeah, this is the ID,
I think. Yeah, this is ID. Let me go
first name.
First name right here. Last name.
And again, you could like you could
spend a few minutes like trying to
figure out where everything is right
here. I just like to put everything
here. I mean, you could also do this,
right? Or title
a photo URL. Yeah, maybe I was just
tripping. Maybe we should do this. Uh,
it saves more time. And then the
icebreaker is the thing that we use as
the connection message. Nothing. That's
it. Right. Let's rename this. Add leads
to Google Sheets.
Let me save this. U. And now you see
this ends. This right here now needs to
go back to loop of items behind. There
we go. So that we loop 20 and then we go
back here, get the next 20, the next 20,
the next 20 until we get these many
items. Okay. So we do everything. We
spit basically we split it. We loop over
items. That's what this is. All right.
So, let me execute the step. Let me test
this thing right here. Um, I should be
able to see different leads coming
through. If I don't, then something is
wrong. We can fix it. Okay, this has to
run first and then we can wait for
everything to go to the Google sheet.
Right now, it's running. We can see that
now we have the different leads. So, ID,
first and last in LinkedIn URL. Let's go
here. There you go. Gino, what is up my
man? Real estate agency. There you go.
This is so good. I mean, you can
actually just Oh, I can't. Yeah, you can
actually just connect to them. So,
connect, add a note, and then literally
just go here. Uh, no, here, copy this,
go here, paste it, and then actually
just send it. Let me actually just send
it. There we go. Boom. And that's it.
And that's how your campaigns can
actually run. And you can do this for
every single one. And the best thing is
you saw me do it manually, but there's
so many softwares that can automate
this. So you simply can have a machine
running through in the back end that's
personalized, like hyperpersonalized to
each person because again, you can only
send 30 connections a day maximum. I
mean, you can, but you you risk getting
banned on LinkedIn. So if you have an
automated platform, you can only send 30
a day. So 30 * 30 900. Like typically
you' only need 900 leads right here
every single month. God, why do I keep
going back to this? Um, you would only
need 900 leads right here every single
month that you can go through. And
again, we can scrape 5,000 for free
every single month. So, this is
literally a no-brainer. Like, everyone
should be using this if you want u to to
I guess run a campaign or run something
in the back end that can work because
the alternative is just you doing it
manually.
Hey, in this video I'm going to build a
full sales coach system inside of Eniden
that takes a transcript of every single
one of my calls. It sends it to a custom
sales coach GPT that is trained on the
best sales frameworks in the world and
then delivers a [music] full breakdown
on Slack with everything that I could
have done better. By the way, this is
literally the exact system that we've
sold [music] to a business for 3K. So
the first part of the automation is
actually me ending the call which
triggers a web hook means it sends the
data to end saying hey we just finished
the call review it right now obviously I
can't do that right now because I'm not
on call but what I'll do is I'll send a
request to this web hook so you can see
what it actually looks like. So we
finish the call then we send the data
here. What it does then is it uses
Fireflies which is the software that
we're using for meeting notes uh to
extract the transcript. Then we're
sending it to a sales coach GPT which is
on our platform the OpenAI um platform
here which is trained on a document
which is this one right here which has a
bunch of frameworks and questions that
you should ask uh for different parts of
the call which analyzes the full call
based on that framework and then sends
us a message on Slack. Right here we can
see that it broke down the start of the
call and also the objections. Clarify
objections. So you missed an opportunity
to clarify the prospect's objectives
early on. A question like what specific
outcomes are you hoping to achieve from
this automation? Would I set clear
expectations and direction? That's
pretty true. Instead you ask, can you
run me through your company first? Which
turn the focus away from the immediate
needs. Now that's pretty good uh
framework. Of course that was this a few
months back so I wasn't the best closer.
I was trying my best but there you go.
So it took all the call and it analyzed
it based on this exact framework, right?
Which is a framework that we use in
sales. I'm going to start from zero. So
I'm going to go plus workflow personal
and then start from zero. So you get to
see what it actually looks like. And we
can start. And as always, we never start
here, but we start here, right? Because
we want to map things out before we
build it. So every automation that we
build has an input and has an output,
right?
So the input in this case, let me make
this unbold.
By the way, if you're wondering what
platform I'm using, it's Miro. Very
good. Uh the input in this case will be
the call recording or call transcript,
right?
This is a pretty easy system. I'm not
going to lie, but it is one of the most
ROI. And what you'll find is that the
easiest systems, not the easiest, but uh
the ones that are easier to build that
are not super complex with 50 AI agents,
uh they're typically the ones that give
the business the most value. Okay? So,
call transcript, which is a transcript
of the call. And by transcript, we mean
what's everything that has been said.
And we know this works because we have
meeting note takers. So, for those of
you who don't know what meeting note
takers are, let's go to Fireflies, for
example, right here. Fireflies, not
this, but this is a noteaker, right?
What this does is that it joins the
calls when you're on a call with a
client. So you hop on a call with the
client and you let it in and it's sort
of like a like a live noteaker. So it's
there, it doesn't speak, of course, it
just takes notes and it transcribes the
call so you can then use it for whatever
it is. I typically have uh the noteaker
on every single call just because it's
great if you missed anything on the call
that you want to look back or action
items or things like these which are
great. That's what we would typically
do. So call transcript, we would use
fireflies. So, let me put here
Fireflies. You also have Fathom. You
have Sibu.ai. You have Loom. Uh there's
a ton of stuff that you that you have in
the market. They're all pretty good. So,
call transcript. And then we want to
basically send it
to the GPT sales GPT.
So, we'll have to make a GPT on the open
air platform, which is actually very
easy. Don't worry. Uh to
to analyze call.
They make this here. And then we have to
send Slack message
with breakdown with feedback.
There we go. See, crazy system. $3,000
for something like this. Uh that took me
about what, one to two hours cuz it was
the first time. Uh but if I were to sell
it to another person, I would take maybe
30 minutes. Um, it all really depends on
what document you're using to the GPT to
actually compare the sales call. All
right, so with that said, let's start
here. Uh, let's start with the first
step, which is call transcript. So,
because we're using Fireflies, what I'm
going to do is I'm going to open up. And
you're going to have to make an account.
I have the free account, so I'm not
paying for this. And you can see here I
have meetings. I have all the meetings
with everyone that I've had. I believe
that I'm above the rate, which is cuz
they gave you like 600 minutes of free
calls. But here's all the meetings that
I have. And so with every single meeting
that I've had, we can transcribe it and
use this exact automation, which is
amazing. And especially because I've had
days where I've had five calls. And so I
wanted every single call transcribed and
gave me feedback and so on. And it
happens instantly cuz it's right after
the call. So where am I going with this?
We have to go here to the settings. And
then we go to developer settings here.
And we can see that we have two
different things. So we're just going to
play around with these two different
things. So the first thing is the API
key, which is sort of like a password.
If you use chatbt in your automations or
claude or gemini or grock or open
router, you always need an API key which
is a password and [music] then we have a
web hook. And this is really why we're
able to make this automation happen is
because we
can transcribe it triggered when
transcription is completed. What this
means is that you go on a call with the
client, it finishes, it then finishes
transcribing the call which takes about
3 five seconds and then it sends a
signal to the automation saying hey this
is the meeting recording or this is the
meeting ID and [music] then we send it
to the next step to take the meeting ID
and then take the transcript from the
call. Okay, it will make much more sense
once I actually build it. Uh but bear in
mind that we are able to send the
notification to the automation once a
meeting is finished. So the first step
is actually adding the web hook. If I go
to end right here, I can add a first
step which is the trigger which is what
is the [music] thing that starts the
automation. And here we have on web hook
call. So again web hook is just a URL
that people use or the servers use to
send signals back and forth. Right? So
the web hook is made right here. You
don't have to do anything. Just get this
just press on it. You copy it and then
if you go back to Fireflies you can
paste it here and you press save. Now a
very important thing that we currently
have a test webbook right if you want to
go in production. So if you want to make
this live activate this you have to
change this to a production URL. The
only difference is is that this has this
in production doesn't right that's it.
So [music] in theory now if you have a
call with a client and you bring in
fireflies then once a call is finished
it will send a signal to this web hook.
So, as I mentioned, I'm not able to be
on a call right now, but I have the
request that we typically get from the
call recording. Right now, in order for
us to send a example request, we're
going to go to Postman API, which is a
new thing that I haven't introduced
before. Uh, but it actually is a really,
really good software. It's actually very
easy to use. It looks a bit fancy and
techy as well. Um, but we use this when
we are testing web hooks, right? Because
something like this to test it, you
would have to go on a call. You had to
finish the call. You need to say
something on the call and it would take
too much time for it to test. So what we
do here is we set up a sample request,
example request. [music]
The first thing we need is to um to add
a URL, which is this right here. So copy
this and paste it here. And we want to
make sure that this is post because get
is getting information. Post is sending
information. So in this case, we're
sending information to the web hook. And
because that is post, we also have to
change this to post. There you go. And
then we need the body raw. So this is a
JSON. JSON is just a language that we
communicate software to software. And we
have to set up the requests. So we have
to set up the actual variables that go
into the web hook for it to start the
automation, which are the ones right
here. So we get a meeting ID and event
type. So right here, if I listen for
test events, I can press send, and this
will send the information here. So
again, if this looks a bit complicated,
just understand that we're not able to
test this. Okay, I have to be on a call.
So we're using Postman API to send a
sample request here. And this is exactly
what we would get every single time when
the call finishes. So it's purely just
for testing. As in when we go live, we
don't use Postman API. We just use the
web hook from the Fireflies. Now that we
have the meeting ID and we don't have
the transcript, we now have to figure
out how to take this transcript from
this meeting ID. So a meeting ID is like
a unique identifier for every single
call that you have. And so if I go to
Fireflies meetings and I go to like a
random one, say on here, this one right
here, the URL on the top, if I go here,
I can see that this is the meeting ID.
So the URL is pretty standard and the
only thing that changes is the meeting
ID and the meeting name. So going back
here, we have to take the meeting ID,
which I can pin now. I don't have to use
Postman API anymore. Uh, and then we can
um look for Fireflies right here.
Fireflies. You would have to install the
thing. It takes like 5 seconds. It's
fine. [music]
And now we want to get the transcript.
Get transcript. So as you can see to get
the transcript, we just have to put the
transcript ID. Now the first thing you
have to do is go here, create a new
credential. You have to get the API key
which you can get here. Uh what was it?
Settings, developer settings and API
key. Just copy this and paste it here to
connect your account. Choose the right
account. And now the resource which is
what is the thing that we are changing
or in general what are we doing? In this
case, it'll be transcript the operation
which is what is the action that we're
doing and you can do a bunch of stuff
and the transcript ID which we get from
here meaning ID. By the way, most of
these variables you don't actually have
to know anything. You just have to know
the body which is the actual variables
that we get which is a meeting ID and
event type. And that's it. So now that
we have the transcript ID, we can press
execute step. This will now I believe
take the transcript. Yep. And the
problem is that we have an array. So, it
didn't give us the transcript
altogether. It gave us different bits of
the transcript. So, sentence one,
sentence two, and this well being a
two-hour call is really, really long.
See, we have about 444 sentences. It
breaks up the transcript into sentences.
So, naturally, the thing you want to do
here is take the sentences and put them
all together. So, the next step is to do
that. So, we have to pin this. And then,
and by the way, I'm pinning this so I
don't have to rerun it again. I can go
to edit fields which is basically taking
a sort of variable and changing it
manipulating data right and we're trying
to get the sentences which are all the
way here really really long and put them
all together to do that we can just call
this transcript so I'm setting a
variable and now if I go full screen I
can sentences because this is the array
again an array is this whole thing full
of all the variables together and we
just want to extract the raw text and to
do that you have to go Here
I believe that is map. Yeah, map. Cuz
we're mapping. We're saying, hey, inside
this I want raw text. So be item equals
item dot
uh raw text.
There you go. You see how we have all
the sentences here right now? All the
sentences.
And the last thing is to actually join
them. So join which is basically taking
out all the quote marks and we just have
a full transcript of a call instead of
this right sentences
with a bunch of variables that are so so
long cuz we could theoretically feed
this to AI but it would just be way too
large it would break definitely break so
we just have the transcript that we need
okay so what do we do we took the
sentences cuz it's 450 sentences or more
but you scroll all the way down and
we're taking the raw text which is the
actual text from that sentence So we
just have all the sentences together and
this is the formula we use map item item
dot the actual name of the item which is
raw text plus [music] join so join which
is joining everything together and
that's it. So now that we have the
transcript going to execute step and the
JSON will just be the whole transcript.
So I'm going to rename this to
clean transcript
and the next step is actually the the
sauce of the whole system. So this is
done.
So the next step here is to make a GBT.
And by the way, a GBT is just a thing
like an AI assistant you could say uh
that is just trained on a specific
thing, right? That allows us to be able
to analyze to talk to to do XYZ. And why
is it better than just a normal one is
because we give it examples. So [music]
for example, Mosy GPT is trained on 200
hours of content and two of his books,
[music]
right? All right. So, you ideally want
to use this instead of using the general
chatgbt uh search bar because this is
trained on these [music] documents. This
is more specific. And so, in this case,
we're not going to use a GBT here, but
we're going to go to
platform.openai.com,
which is the API platform, right? Where
we actually use automations back and
forth. By the way, I made a full video
showing you how you can build with agent
kit video up here. But the thing that we
want to do is to be able to create a
project. So, if you just logged into
platform.opai.com,
you most likely don't have a project.
So, create one. Let's name it uh in it
and test create.
Go to dashboard. Go to assistants
because these are the assistants that we
make. And by the way, if I go to my
previous project, you can see that I
already have assistance.
You can press create an assistant.
Create. And now this is where we make
the GPT. Okay. The thing that actually
uh is going to be able to analyze our
calls. So I'm going to name this sales
coach. And the instructions is the
prompt. So let's say I want an AI
assistant to just give me feedback on my
sales calls. I am taking sales calls
every day for and I have an AI
automation agency that helps clients to
automate their processes and be more
[music] efficient in the business. And
the founder is Mikuel M I C H E. And I'm
the one who's hopping on the calls and
I'm also the sales rep.
I'm doing everything. Um so there you
go. Press create.
And I'm using AI because typically
that's what you guys would do. But I'll
show you exactly if this is a good
prompt or not good prompt. And this
right here wasn't here. I believe a few
months ago. I think it's almost recent.
And it gave us a full um prompt. It's
actually not bad. So the founder is
Mikuel. You don't have to spell it step.
I just didn't want it to say Michelle.
That's cool. Uh providing actionable
feedback on sales calls for any
automation agency founded by the user.
Let's write in markdown formatting. So
overview this just means heading one. So
it just hierarchy of like text just as
[music] you would for a normal essay.
And then here it would be objective.
Your objective is to analyze each
submitted sales call. Identify strength.
That is pretty decent. Um I'm not going
to give it any examples.
And one thing we need to add here is the
document that the GPT will use to
actually give feedback on a call.
So, I'm going to put file and I'm going
to drop in the file that we're going to
use to be able to um to transcribe or
not transcribe to give feedback on the
call and it's this file. So, this is the
file that I'm going to using. So, it's a
PDF that has 10 steps framework has
introduction. So, hey John, how's
everything going? Uh agenda. What I like
to do in this call is really just to ask
you a few questions, get to know a
little bit more about you and really see
if and how I could actually help. That's
not fair. It's crazy. I used to because
I used to be in sales. So well I can't
call me a closer but I was I was a
setter um vision based questions
challenge based questions and these are
considered good right and this is a
course program that I was in and they
gave us this framework so I'm going to
use this to be able to compare it to our
call and yeah that's it so with that
said we have the framework PDF I can
attach it and what this will now do is
it will turn this into a vector store
and what that means is that it's taking
the PDF in this is text. It's
transforming it into embeddings and then
it's vectorizing the data. That's why
it's called a uh let me go here. It's
called a vector vector store. And then
we're adding it to a vector database,
right? Database. So you hear vector
database. It just means that it's full
of like information whether it's an
image, audio, video, and text. In this
case, it's just a PDF that is turned
into a number. So that we then context,
hey, can you pull information from XYZ?
which will then vectorize my question
which means it will take my question
turn that into 0 1 0 0 0 1 it will then
check it against the vector store that
we have which are all different vectors
lines and stuff with all numbers it will
match the numbers and then give us the
answer okay which is much more efficient
than anything else that's why rack
systems are very very good um I need to
turn this on but it's telling me that
the file search is not enabled for this
model
let's try GBT5 or GBT41
yeah there you go so not all models uh
can retrieve data in this case we can
use for one file search and now we can
say what is it that is called
millionaire closers framework okay so
when it's giving feedback I wanted to
give feedback from like taking
information from the millionaire closers
framework PDF that I uploaded in the
file search um and just give feedback
based on that. So now it's doing its
thing and we also have a few settings
that we can change down below which I'll
explain in just a second. All right. So,
I just finished this and then full
screen. Let me change this again. It
keeps changing it to the other one.
Overview.
Uh, you're assistant closers [music]
PDF. So, we're saying hey, you are a
assistant specializing in providing
actionable feedback. So, the reason why
most of the prompts that you see out
there start with you are an AI system uh
AI assistant is because we are giving it
a system prompt. A system prompt is a
prompt that we give an AI in general
with an identity. So if you tell an AI
you are this type of person, it will
psych itself to think that it actually
is that thing is that identity. So then
the output will be better, right? It
will be better in every single way
possible. So for this example right
here, imagine you had a sales call come
through. You have to analyze the sales
call and you have to use AI to do it. If
one AI was given the hey a you were a
helpful intelligent sales assistant
that's done this for 10 years versus
another one that doesn't have it this
will be higher quality because it's now
given an identity that's it analyze each
submitted use sales call referencing
only the mill closer framework yeah I'm
just taking off the apostrophes because
that's not what the the actual thing has
and now it's really just about testing
right so I'm going to press save and we
can test it right here but before that I
also have these model configurations so
the response format will be X that's
fine then we have temperature and the
higher the temperature the more random
the model will be the lower the
temperature the more strict the AI is
with the rules that we give it okay then
we have top which is the higher the top
the more it will use different words the
lower top the more it will use the same
words right so it'll start using
actually the same words all so I'm going
to test this I'm just going to drop in a
transcript which I can get right here
let me just copy
Copy selection. I can paste this. Yeah,
that's good. That's good. Paste this
here. I can run. And you're basically
running this actual like agent GPT. You
don't have to run it through the
automation. You can just run it here.
So, reasoning,
frame, control, and agenda.
The prospect will inter extensive
details about the business. The rep
asked several questions. I don't know if
I like this too much. I'm not going to
lie, cuz it also gives us null, which is
a bit mad. Yeah, I don't want any of
this. Like, this is this is pretty
pretty So,
it's not that good. Um, plus it took a
lot of tokens to do it. So, I'm actually
going to paste the prompt that I had
before, just right here, uh, which is
much shorter. And I said, you're a sales
closer expert. I'm going to do overview.
with over 30 years of experience in
teaching sales, you know the exact
framework that will get a prospect to
buy and are expert in reviewing people's
calls and so on. Then I give it my
context and then rules and guidelines.
Now the important thing here and the
actual use case is that the this will
not be the CEO but most likely right it
will be his sales team that does calls
and then you review the calls using a
GBT here and then you give feedback on
the calls so they can actually get
better and that's literally it. So let
me paste this again the the actual call.
Let me go back to I can copy this. Copy
selection. Paste this here. Run. And now
it should give us a shorter answer.
Opportunities null. Okay. Let's just see
how it looks like on the actual
automation. I'm not going to judge here.
So, let's just see what it looks like.
But I like this more cuz it's it's uh
it's shorter. And it also seems like
it's a bit more random. So, let me turn
this down a little bit. Let's do
uh eight. Let me try this again. And
this is all about testing, right? So
theoretically, you won't have the actual
answer like in your head. We just have
to test.
So by putting it lower, I'm saying, hey,
you can't don't be so creative, right?
Like just follow the framework, follow
the prompt that we give it, and it's
actually better. Well, I don't know if
it's better, but it's giving us Yeah,
it's giving us a better answer to be
honest. We'll just put it to test in the
automation. We'll see how how it does.
Cool. I like the I like this one right
here. Sample script experts from the
next call. All right. Now that we have
this, we can now connect this to our N10
workflow. So all we have to do is go to
plus look for open AAI and then usually
you actually message a model but in this
case you want to assistant to create an
message an assistant. There you go.
To connect your OpenAI you have to go to
get the API key which you can get from
platform.opai.com.
Go to dashboard. Go to API keys.
Press create a new secret key. So any
test
create a key. And then you can copy this
and bring it back here and put m
19th of October. Save. Now you have the
connection to your account saved. And
now the resource will be assistant. The
action that we're taking is messaging
and assistant. So we're doing the same
thing that we did before here. We're
just doing it automatically.
And now from the list, we want to uh get
the sales coach. That's it. Bear in mind
that when you make an assistant on this
[clears throat] project and then you
make an API key on this project, you
will not be able to see this assistant
here. So make sure that you make the
assistant on the project where you also
get the API key in. Right? That's
important. So you can see here I got the
API key from this project and intent
test. Then we have to add the user
message. So the user message will be uh
not chatter node it will be defined
below because we're defining the user
message. If I make this bigger
expression make this bigger I can copy
the prompt and I can say your task is to
give feedback on this call by looking at
the transcript. Uh rules make the
feedback concise and very tactical
pointing out exactly what I could have
done better on the call. Provide
specific quotes in the call when given
feedback and remove this right here
which is typically what it gives us um
when it sources the actual data or the
the text. That's it. And then don't use
markdown formatting because the next
step is Slack and Slack doesn't have
marked on formatting. Uh if you don't
know what markdown formatting is, it's
litally this
heading one is this. Then we have
heading two. But it doesn't actually
this is great if you have like some
softwares that read markdown formatting.
So it wouldn't actually output this. It
would just output the heading two in the
format of heading two. But in this case,
we don't have it with Slack. So it's
fine. And now this is finished. So make
this green. And the last thing is send a
Slack message with feedback. Want to go
here first. Rename this to sales coach.
Let me actually run this so I can see
how it works. This is now theoretically
talking to this agent, [music]
not agent GPT
and getting the answer. As you can see
here, we have the output which is sales
call feedback mill and closer framework
opening report strength. Okay,
cool.
And now let me pin this. We can add
Slack just the last uh node and we can
message a channel send a message. To
connect our Slack just go here to create
your credential. You can connect your
account and just log in. Literally just
choose your organization that you have.
For me it's JM solutions and then you
can allow connection successful. Go back
to NN. You can put JM solutions.
As you can see I already done it before
right here. Have another one. Now the
thing that we're changing is a message
or manipulating. The action that we're
taking is sending send a message to
channel. If I go to Slack, I can see
that all the channels I have are these
ones which are all for testing. So when
you make a Slack account, this is a free
account as well. So you will have the
free account. Just literally make a
channel. So you can create a channel and
you can name it call reviews or whatever
it is. And this will be the channel that
we use. Now bear in mind that the
channel ID is also here. I believe it's
either this or this. I think it's this.
Um but we don't have to use the ID. We
can just simply select from the options
because it will be call reviews and then
it will be send a simple text message
and the message text will be the output
which is a feedback of the call. So if I
press execute step
we should now see that we have a um
feedback. This is way too long. If I had
to read this for every single call that
I have, I probably wouldn't want to take
calls anymore. Um so we definitely need
to say make it shorter.
Yeah, I think it will have to be here.
Um, rules.
Make a concise
without writing massive paragraphs.
Not the best prompt, not going to lie.
Um, so let me execute this step again.
No, let me execute this step. Unpin. Let
me execute the step.
Now I'm running this. We have the
output. Let me pin this. And let me test
this again. Let me run this.
If I go here, I can see that I have the
Okay, that's much better. You see how
changing prompt can just change
everything here. We control an agenda
setting. Early in the call, you like the
prospect, take the lead. I'm quite
direct and I can just go cut straight to
the chase. It's true. Um, yeah. Cool. I
I love the fact that they're pulling in
quotes. Like the code stuff is really
really good cuz it tells you exactly
what you said and what you could have
said better. So, for example, says here
when she said, "I just probably wouldn't
have the time to do it." basically and
you moved on to technical detail.
Instead, drill down the tell me more
about what not having the time is
costing the business. Where have things
broken down or gone wrong because of
this? Not bad. Not bad. Um,
okay. So, we have the full exact
framework that we want. Ideally, I want
to see the name of the call at the top.
So what I can do here in Slack is I can
go down to get a transcript and I should
be able to see the name of the call
right here title and then you can say
breakdown
feedback. And now if I execute the step
I can now see that I have basically the
same thing which you can now use and we
have the full breakdown.
Hey, in this video I'm going to show you
step by step how I built a lead
generation system inside of Naden that
allows us to scrape thousands of leads
using Google Maps. Then we extract the
URLs of the websites. [music] Then we
look for the emails inside the websites
before adding it to our Google sheet
database which allows us to then reach
out to them and get business. All right,
so [music] this right here is a system.
I'm going to run it from scratch. We're
going to walk through how it works. The
first part is scraping a URL which is a
link of Google Maps. Now, that's a link
that you typically go to Google Maps for
in case you want to cold call or cold
email. And what this will now do is it
will extract the URLs, which is the the
websites that are in here. It will
remove any duplicates. It will filter
the ones that actually have a URL, like
a real one. And then it goes here to
scraping the website, finding the emails
of each website, and then at the end,
after having scraped every single one
that's in the Google Maps URL, it will
add it to our Google Sheet database. And
then once it's scraped every single URL
and emails inside the URLs, then it adds
them all to our Google Sheet database.
Or we can see here that we have 25
emails, right, out of 32 websites that
we scraped. And so these right here are
all the emails that we can now use to
run our cold outreach. Now, cold
outreach just stands for reaching out to
people who are cold, who have no idea
who we are. So what I would do after
this is hook them up to an email
sequence uh software which means that
there's some software that allow you to
write emails automatically to each
person and so that you just run an email
campaign automatically and you can use
the system every other day uh to scrape
new leads to scrape new emails and then
reach out to them. All right, so let's
go through the whole system step by step
and show you how it works. The first
part is the Google maps data extraction.
So if I go here, we're running this
manually right now, but it would
typically be a what would it be on on
schedule because ideally we don't want
to go to any to have to run this
manually every single time. So we use
something like this which allows us to
be able to run the system every day or
every second, minute, hour, days, weeks,
months. It has very custom formulas. So
we can put this as an automatic first
step. But in this case, we have this
manually. Now the real first step to why
this is possible. So, if I go in here,
we're using a HTTP request. Now, HTTP
stands for hypertext transfer protocol.
Yeah, there you go. Hypertext transfer
protocol, which is a very fancy word to
say, hey, we're taking a URL like this.
So, let me just copy this and paste it
in Google, which is literally us going
to Google Maps and putting agencies in
New York, which are all the agencies in
New York right here. And we are scraping
this, this, this, all the websites that
are here, all of them, right? We're
going to each one so you don't have to
essentially. And so the HTTP request
allows us to be able to get the method
is just what are we doing in this case?
We're getting information all of this,
right? And if I go here and show you
exactly how this actually works to
inspect on the right hand side, this is
what it's scraping the HTML behind the
page network. There's a ton of stuff, a
ton of different little codes and
language here that allows the HTTP
request to be able to extract the whole
information out of this page which then
is useful for us for the next steps. And
as you can see here, the data which is
the output like what is the thing that
this the system is giving us to start
with is just this right doc type HTML
and there's a ton of stuff here. So I go
to JSON which is the way that you can
also represent this. It's a long long
JSON string which again is the JSON not
JSON but is the HTML behind the actual
website right which you can then use.
And by the way, if this is the first
time that you see this node right here,
HTTP or maybe you never used it before,
then check out this video up here where
I show you the fundamentals of how it
works. All right, now that we have this,
let me pin this because now the output
is just this, right? HTML. We use a code
node, right? Again, we're coding now,
but we're using a JavaScript code to be
able to turn this long, long HTML into
this, right? Which are all websites. If
I go to schema, I can see that we have
229 items, which means that it found 229
websites. For example, we have
schema.org. And we have a ton more,
right? Let's let's go https
fontsgatic.com.
This is a invalid URL, right? For
example, and so what this does, let me
paste into chatgvt. That's usually what
I would do if I didn't know what the
code did and say, "Can you break this
down into one sentence explain what this
does?"
Typically, the input is the HTML, which
is the long string of HTML text that we
get and we take the first input JSON. We
find all the website URLs using regular
expression. So, we call this regex. is
just a a fancy way to say that we let's
say we have a long text and it finds
things that are like prominent right so
for example every website that we know
has https semicolon slash so it finds
all the websites that are within that
reoccurring sort of text right and then
it extracts all of them and then it
returns them as a list of separate JSON
objects and that's essentially what it
does because again here we have these
right so it extracts these which it
finds it knows because well sort of
every website has https And then it has
com orit or whatever depending on what
country and it leaves these alone which
are not websites. We want to make this
run once for all items and we want to
use JSON which is JavaScript object
notation and then we're just giving it
this data right which is this first.json
ddata and we get this. Now once we have
this we now have a list of 229 websites
that we can now use to be able to
scrape. Right now, as you can see here,
229 websites entered this new node, but
34 only went out. It's because we have a
filter here. We filter by the URLs that
schema.org, right? Which is not a real
website or Google websites or GG
websites or Gstatic websites. These are
not websites that we can scrape that
have emails in them. And so what we do
here is we say the website does not
contain, right? which is a string does
not contain because string is just
saying hey it does not contain within
the text schema and it does not contain
Google and it does not contain gg and
gstatic because these are the signs that
it's not an actual website for example
so you can see here we have all the ones
that are invalid I go here https gstatic
these are all invalid websites and so we
don't want to script those websites we
only want to script the ones that are
actual websites for example this right
here
go here and I can see that this is an
actual business and that's the ones that
we use for the next steps. So we have
this filter step right here and then
once we have 34 websites that are actual
websites that we can scrape we are
removing duplicates which means that we
are taking a list of 20 for example like
these and we're looking hey is there any
duplicates in the actual list. [music]
Well, as you can see here, yes, we have
this, this, that, that duplicate, and
these three so on. And so we just take
them. We say, hey, remove items repeated
within the current input, which is this.
And we want to compare all fields. And
this is the output that we get. We get a
list of websites that are actual
websites that are not repeated that we
can use to then extract the emails from.
There we go.
Going to pin this. I'll pin this as
well. Now, this step up here actually
doesn't have to be here. It's just for
production, uh, sorry, for testing
because we're limiting the amount of
items, the amount of websites that we're
sending through just to test. But you
could delete this and have this pass
through all the items from remove
duplicates. But here we have the um,
we're basically saying, hey, only let
10,000 websites through as a limit. And
now, this is where we start the
scraping. Now, so far, these are nodes
that you've probably never seen before
in an actual automation together, right?
The HTTP code, uh, filter, remove
duplicates, and limit. And we also have
the loop over items again. So we script
the websites. We extract the URLs of the
websites. Then we go here and we filter
and we say hey is this a Google website
or is this an actual website. If it's an
actual one then we send it to the next
step which basically takes the whole
list. It removes all the duplicates and
then we do here is now we go into the
process of scraping. Now scraping just
means that you go inside. So let's say I
go to uh let me go let me take an
example here.
custom staffing. There we go. This one
right here. And what we're doing here is
we are extracting all the text which you
can find here. So every single website
that you see in the internet has HTML.
It's consisted of HTML which is why
we're able to put these buttons, make
this orange, make this white, make this
blue, right? We're able to make websites
not just a Google document, right? Make
them look pretty. It's all HTML. So what
the server does it just goes here and
extracts that to be able for us to go
through the next step which is again
going down the loop way which is just
looping so going through each website
over and over again and we're only
sending one item so one website through
at the same time. So we send one item
which is what I said we then script the
website using just a simple HTTP again
get request. So we're getting the whole
HTML
of the website here. We just drag this
across. So this is all the code that we
spoke about. And one thing that I also
added here is the ability for the
workflow to continue even though there's
an error. Why? Well, is because some
websites when you scrape them, they
don't allow you to scrape the website.
As in there's a there's an encryption
that that says, "Hey, this is private.
You need a password or you need some
sort of authentication to get inside.
And if that happens, this will error
out. It'll be an error." So what we're
saying, hey, you can still continue the
automation even though it might fail at
the same time. And so what we do for the
next step after we extracted all the
language behind the website is we wait.
Now the reason why we wait about yeah 1
second is because of the fact that we
don't want to run into any rate limits.
And rate limits usually happens when you
script websites over and over and over
again really really fast. So you want to
give it some room to breathe. 1 second
is enough. Um you can put two so you're
able to make sure that you are actually
able to script all these websites. And
then what we do here is we go to a
similar sort of node right here. Well,
it's the same node, right? But it's a
similar function. And we extract the
emails. So the input is this, which is
the data here. So this right here, this
this this whole thing that you see that
you probably get confused about. This
just says, hey, this is the typical way
that people write emails. Okay? And the
email is usually text here, right,
before the app and then gmail.com and
then something.com or something. And so
what we're seeing here is this. We're
saying, hey, we're basically looking at
patterns. So every email usually has
these characters before the ad, these
characters after the ad, and then some
sort of text. And so that's what we
extract from the website to then get the
emails. And [music] sometimes it cannot
read properties of undefined reading
match, which means that it didn't find
it. But if I go here to
say 21 so on, you can see that it found
a ton of emails from the same company
that it uses. And so again, we're using
code to be able to extract all the
emails from the script of the website.
So from the HTML, from the language
behind the website that we can then do
for every single website that we have.
And when this is finished, we then send
it up here to wait again. We give it 5
seconds just to give it some room to
breathe. And then we have to filter out
the websites that don't have any emails.
So we're saying, hey, this is a JSON
email right here. If this exists, then
send it through. If it doesn't exist,
then don't send it through. In this
case, you see that we had uh these
emails come up and the emails that
didn't come up were these ones because
we couldn't find them or it was just
yeah, null just means that there's
nothing there. This just means that it
was an error that we can't read the
property and we're only keeping the ones
that we can't find right here. Before
taking these emails which are in an
array, array just means that it's in a
way where we have different information
inside the information and we're taking
this block and we're splitting it out.
Right? So what this means is that we're
taking all these emails and we're
processing each one individually. Okay,
that's what an array is. Array is just
something that has this inside is that
you go to the grocery store and the
groceries is banana, strawberries,
fruits, xyz. These is the different
items within the grocery list. We're
splitting it out into each one. So you
can see now we have 110 emails,
different pages,
right? they can then send to another
remove duplicate because as you can see
here there are some duplicates as well
within the emails and so we want to
remove those and so out of 110 emails we
only kept 25 which I go in here I can
see that it's the same exact setting
remove items repeated within the current
input with the input is this and this is
the output list of emails which you can
now use to be able to add to our Google
sheet database right here
which you can then use for email
campaigns. Now, can you use Apify to do
all of this? Yes, but Apify isn't free,
as in you still have to pay for it. Um,
I guess it is more reliable in a sense,
as in Apify has their own scrapers. You
can add more stuff there. But just the
fact that we're able to put a URL right
here and we can change this to agencies
in I don't know, Canada,
right here. agencies is in Ontario. That
didn't come up. Agencies, let's do
agencies.
Again, you can do agencies in a specific
location.
And then these are all the agencies that
it will use that it will extract the
information from. In this case, we're in
New York, the one and only. Um, and this
[music] will be the thing that it will
extract to then be able to then get all
the emails. Now, one thing that we could
do actually is this. We could instead of
running this on a daily basis because it
would extract the same exact websites.
Now that I thought of it, you can have
another page here and a page would be
websites or businesses to scrape
and you can have
I don't know like agencies in New York,
agencies in Canada or whatever like
flooring businesses. You can have a ton
of businesses here that you can use and
then you can hook this up. So if I go
here, I can press plus. I can then look
for sheets,
get rows, look for our Google sheet,
which is a emails. It'll be sheet one, I
believe. No, sheet two. Let's call this
businesses
so we know we can keep track. Okay, be
 two. And now we can run this. So if
I run this here, I can now get these
agencies in New York, right? And so what
will happen here is that we have to hook
this up to the Google sheet to the
actual Google maps. And we know that
everything that goes after the search is
something that changes, right? Because
Google Maps search everything behind
here because everything before here is
just static, which means it's the exact
same for every single URL. But here
something that we can change and so what
we can do pretty high level but we can
take this we can put it here right and
watch this we can go inside I don't
think I've done this before but uh we
can press plus and then
replace all
um space spaces with plus why did I do
that is because apify or not aify http
request don't allow you to have spaces
and so as you can see here we had so
agencies in New York we had agencies
plus
in plus new plus York and so that's what
we're doing here we're taking this we're
saying okay make it so that in the
spaces we only have plus and now if I
run this let me go here
okay I need to unpin this though
if I run this now this should work from
the Google sheet
three went through all three
each one individually that we can then
use to go through the whole system. So
where was I going with this? Well, I was
going to say that you can have a list of
businesses to scrape
here and then at the end of the the
actual thing you can have a update a row
which is updating here and saying added
and you can put yes and then now here
you can also put a filter and says hey
don't send the ones that have yes in
here. So you always send the ones that
are new that you haven't scripted
before. You can have a whole list right
here. Congrats on finishing the ultimate
course on Nitn which took you from a
real beginner in automations in general
and Nitn to someone who's actually able
to build automations for themselves and
for other businesses. We answered the
question of what is automation and then
going diving deep into the exact tool
which is Nitn which allows us to build
automations step by step. Then we looked
at more of the theoretical standpoint to
automations and understanding how
softwares speak to softwares along with
actually building AI agents, building
workflows, and then putting them into
practice by building tangible systems
that you can implement into businesses.
And I hope that now gave you a lot of
use cases that you can think of when
going out to businesses or even for
yourself to implement. With that said, I
really hope that you enjoyed this Nitan
course and I recommend that you keep
this unnecessarily long course of Nitan
and automations in a back pocket
whenever you want to go back to it. With
that being said, I hope you found value
from this video and I'll see you in the
next
