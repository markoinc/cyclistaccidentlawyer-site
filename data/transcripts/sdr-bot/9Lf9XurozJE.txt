# Category: ghl-chatbot

all right everybody we're actually so
super excited we have Andrew Hagen who
is like the creator of this crazy bot
that I'm about to show you today called
zappy chat we're going to literally do
an install from start to finish
throughout this entire video this is
probably one of the most advanced spots
I've seen over the last like two years
and it's Advanced
significantly but before anything else I
definitely wanted to give Andrew like a
little bit of a spotlight here we've
know I've known Andrew for now I think
going on four years Andrew I think it's
been four years that's insane like right
at the beginning of high level right
when you're coming in and right when
zappy chat was making its early kind of
like showings but give me a little bit
of your background Andrew just so then
we know who we're talking to and then a
little bit of zappy chat history yeah
for sure so before I made it into the
high LEL space I was a youth pastor and
then a forensic accountant and then a
head of finance and then came into high
level so background all over the place
but yeah so zappy chat initially started
just like a single side product
connected to Google dialogue flow which
was Google's large like anguage model
nothing like chat gbt today and so like
figured out a way to do conversational
booking in high level back in the fall
of 2020 uh I think it was August 2020
and so that put us in a position where
we were working with conversational
booking working with AI working with the
tools that existed at that time but then
obviously back at the beginning of 2023
when chat gbt burst onto the scene and
kind of completely blew everyone's Minds
with what AI could do we were uniquely
positioned to just slot that into the
systems we already had the learnings we
already had and immediately just use a
new brain there to create this
conversational AI system that can be
entirely customized for any sort of
situation book conversation on to
calendars qualify leads handle support
FAQs and respond on any channel through
high level and now also outside of high
level using live chat widgets directly
on sites that don't even need a CRM to
function so it's just been a wild ride
of the last four years and particularly
the last 18 months or so here has been
uh really fun to be a part of oh so I
got a few questions here that I gotta
kind of like probe a little bit on so
for accounting that's I never knew that
about you so I didn't know that's pretty
intense that is not like a light job of
accounting if I recall right yeah I mean
it was really fun for me because I love
XEL like I love spreadsheets as a matter
of fact yeah there's my prop my favorite
hat here
spreadsheets I'm a massive spre nerd and
basically all I did was just build
Financial models for different
industries that had experience some sort
of loss and determine like what Revenue
they lost and what insurance companies
owed them and we did a few fraud cases
as well but yeah just sitting in front
of spreadsheets all day so definitely
like a little bit of a logic kind of
background that kind of goes a little
bit into like AI as soon as yeah as soon
as I discovered high level and got into
high level like I loved at the time it
was triggers and campaigns now workflows
way better but just like the logic of
being able to create these systems and
automations around it was so much fun
for me and then bringing AI into it like
it's all been obviously from that
experience I don't have a technical
background in terms of coding or
developing I hire other people to pay to
do that but I love the logic element and
love making systems to improve things
and to improve those systems and like
sit me down in a spreadsheet for a
couple hours and I get lost and just
have a great time there so there's a
little TMI background information yeah
know that's I mean that's great but it
makes sense right now I know you
mentioned one of the things that I just
want to make sure that the audience
really understands right so like when we
were talking about like the Google
digiflow this is actually really really
important a lot of people don't realize
this AI has been around for many years
right like I'm talking about like
probably closer probably 10 years if not
more right oh yeah oh yeah like even
what we colloquially call AI these days
artificial intelligence we're now mostly
talking about things like chat gbt these
large language learning models that are
able to interact with us in a
conversational way but artificial
intelligence you know you can go back
decades into the I don't know into the '
80s 90s in terms of likeing and and just
sort of artificial intelligence I'm
beginning to talk out of school here
where like I don't know a ton about the
background I just know a ton about how
it works now but artificial intelligence
has been around in different capacities
for decades and like Google dialog flow
had a version that could Converse and
could like we said be able to book on
but you had to like teach it different
intents so you had to be like an early
intent that we added in was like
indifferent approval where someone just
says like sure when you offer them to
available versus a yes yeah and just
like giving dialog flow a list of like
these are sort of indifferent approval
where people are just like non-committal
and we want you to go ahead and book the
appointment for the first time you know
if I tell you 10 or noon and you say
sure I'm going to be like great we're
booked for 10 and so just like training
things like that versus now where we
have this incredibly smart language
model that you can just prompt it kind
of give it a role give it its goal and
context and then set it loose and anyone
who has ever played with chat GPT or any
of the other large language models knows
like what it's capable of now hey we
want to interrupt this video for a quick
little minute to just let you know that
I hope you're enjoying this video we
want to thank you for being here but
more importantly we're hoping that this
content helps you do whatever you're
trying to do inside a high level we also
want to let you know that you have
options to get additional help we offer
a 197 a month VIP coaching program that
includes four days of office hours first
come first serve with Andy or myself
where we go in and we answer any of your
questions that you might have live with
a group setting for other people that
are also working in high level we also
have a VIP group where we answer
questions directly oneon-one with
anybody posting in that group to give
you the absolute best support it also
comes with a bunch of other features
including our frontal brick system our
little mini course and more importantly
a couple guides that will help you
through this and also including our sop
library that we use for pretty much
everything inside of our agency so thank
you for this quick little minute but
more importantly go back to the video
get whatever you need and if you have
any questions that we can answer inside
the video just drop a comment on the
video and we'll make sure to answer
whenever we get a chance and now back to
the show yeah know that's pretty wild I
mean so going from where you had to
train it to where now it's like pretty
much like self- evolving and just like
knows and understands based on you know
all the different advances that happened
literally over the last 18 months if not
probably a little bit sooner but
regardless of which and it's like a
weird hockey puck progression it's not
like it learned a little bit it
literally went from here to like here
and it's just been ongoing and it's
growing ever since which is pretty I
mean I love it I'm like you I have a
logic background so like I love the
logic piece of it this is why we've been
excelling so well in high level because
it has all these functions now you
mentioned that zappy chat does a variety
of functions and again this is where I
think it's really important for the
audience to understand most common Bots
even the Bots currently in high level
have like a function meaning they are
either an appointment setter they're
either an FAQ person meaning they're
answering questions it's really hard at
leasing the account with the current
conversational AI for it to do both I
know for a fact trying to myself that it
does get confused on times if you give
it too many tasks or the instructions
are not right how would you say like
zappy chat difference what's the key
differentiator there because there is
there is a very key differentiator just
in that itself alone from the
conversational AI that high level has
versus what zappy chat can do yeah so
the fundamental difference is that the
zappy chat AI can be customized in terms
of its prompt and it's that is you know
its role what it's doing what it's
fulfilling and what information it has
it can be customized on a per contact
basis so that the AI can actually use
information based on that contact based
on a tag they have based on what
workflows they've been through based on
what offers they are what stage they are
in your pipeline you know once more the
highle logic thing it's like any logic
that you can do you can then change the
prompt for that where it's like maybe
Nuno is a brand new lead who's curious
about the offer and so I want it to be
more in sales mode and book them to a
demo appointment but maybe Andrew is an
active customer who has Tech questions
and so I want to answer those questions
and if he does want a call I don't want
to push him towards a call but if he
does want to call I want to provide him
times for the support calendar you can
set up systems to literally take care of
any conversation and really provide that
sort of connective tissue to the
marketing automations that we're all
familiar with because whether it's high
level or back in the day of other
platforms like you can create these
automated systems that send and outbound
but then when the customer the lead
responds with an inbound message you
have to do some manual work to kind of
like do the connective tissue to get it
to the next step to do that like
connecting piece and so zapy chat AI
really provides these AI agents that can
dynamically adapt to the situation and
can handle any sort of conversation and
so rather than just approaching it as
take this one action then this next
action we're now like hey this agent is
going to sit here and is going to handle
this sort of connective process to get
them from opting in to booking a sales
appointment or from a support query to
getting an answer or booking a support
call whatever that looks like so long
story short you can completely customize
and so therefore can do so much more
than kind of what is put into the
conversational AI over in high level and
then there's just also the element of
the pricing is a big one as well where
two cents a message over with high
levels AI or paying $79 $9 a sub account
for unlimited we actually have a way to
do it completely marginless where you
get full unlimited usage with one of our
API keys or you just pay the cost
directly to the AI provider oh wow so
there's no no markup on that well I was
not aware with that I didn't even
understand that there was a cost
difference so so zappy chat can be a
standalone product or it can actually be
added to the agency for everybody to
have the functionality right so that's
pretty amazing again that there is a
cost differentiator there that is really
really cool but not only that so I'm a
big follower of Andrew like I said I'm
known for four years so anything that
Andrew puts out I usually buy I was
actually one of the first people that
bought zappy chat like in the early
stages like ironically enough like we
put it into use really early on we were
using the digiflow when it first came
out we used it for a little while and
then we stopped because of all the stuff
that was going on with Chach TP and now
all of a sudden here we are we're back
again and then the really cool part
about it is as you can see Andrew's
incredibly full of knowledge his whole
entire team is full of knowledge and
they work in conjunction with HL Pro
Tools which also supports zappy chat
which is also another benefit of like
going with that Suite we use HL Protools
for support we use zappy chat now for
our Ai and the technicians in HL
Protools which are part of our team they
now do both which is super exciting
especially for our clients are using
that in our software version of high
level which I think is pretty cool but
then there is also I was so impressed by
this and I got to kind of like put it
here in perspective here I went into the
members area for the first time in a
while now remember I'm an old schooler
and this in itself alone I don't know if
you guys can see my screen but this is
amazing not only do they give you a
variety of like you know your get
started here and everything else this is
a full course for a quick little setup
how to set up your entire AI additional
features that all come with this look at
this thing you have live chat where we
talked about Cy integration which is an
outside software for calendars
clickfunnels the old school Nemesis of a
high level but still a go-to for a lot
of people qualification web hooks that
you can do all this kind of crazy crazy
stuff that's going in here and they have
correct me if I'm wrong you have daily
office hours are like are there certain
days a week yeah we have multiple Live
support calls every day of the week I'm
on three or four of those a week and we
have some Partners handle other ones we
also have some sales coaching calls paid
ads and creative coaching calls and AI
customization calls so we have multiple
Live support calls every day of the
sorry every workday of the week we don't
yeah very very nice yeah we like to take
our weekend off right so then I got to
ask what is the self- selling snapshot
yeah so the self- selling AI is a way to
demo conversational AI to potential
leads where it takes the leads website
scrapes it and generates an AI agent to
like run a demo specifically for their
business so if you are doing Nuno
Plumbing so let's say I'm an agency
owner and I used you in the past you've
done good work in my house and so I'm
like hey Nuno I've been working on this
new tool for or businesses would you
mind testing it out for me just text
this number the word AI you know you can
set up any sort of trigger word or you
can base it on a form and run ads to it
but then when you texted AI it says like
great I'm going to run this demo for you
just give me your website you put in
newos plumbing.com it scrapes the
website and it goes all right I'm a
plumbing assistant and so it's going to
then go in and say like hey can you tell
me about the issue you're having in your
home and have some back and forth
conversation about your plumbing issue
before offering to book an appointment
book you into an appointment and then
say like hey how was that do you want to
get that set up for your business let's
chat and so it's this
incredible what Matt calls like a
Cinnabon experience where it gives you
like the smell it gives you the sample
taste and you
just and so this was actually birthed
out of something that I put together
last year I think it was May of last
year and I texted it to a couple friends
earnestly like business owners wanting
to test it and three of the four friends
I texted said like whoa that was really
cool can I like can we set this up in my
business I was like oh yeah and it was
at that point I was like yes this is a
good idea we should get this into the
hands of agency owners and so that is so
cool now funny is for anybody that
doesn't know Matt Ceno uh a really good
friend of mine again also known for
quite a few years I actually coached for
Matt well I call the Elon Musk of like
of like crms or SAS versions of this and
he comes up with these like phrases I
didn't know that that Cinema that's
actually pretty funny the other one is
like easy like CCO you know I'm a big
fan of his and some of the things he
says but that's pretty cool and then
just let's talk about a little bit about
this B bonuses what is all this yeah so
these are just some white label
resources to help agencies be able to
sell the AI and so we've got a couple
white label sales funnels I think
there's three of them in there right now
we've got a wh label like template for a
speed to lead infographic ebooks white
label slide deck wh label ad some email
templates and lastly some wh label like
Facebook demo videos some templates to
use for Facebook videos as well so we're
always adding in some additional free
Bon in here because in this space like
we only win if our customers win and so
we're always aiming to like make it
easier to build and run in AI agency
here that is amazing and then again just
template libraries just some different
template libraries for different uh yeah
so like prompt templates I think it's
over 50 templates at this point for
dozens of different niches and different
situations there so you can take those
promp templates and use them in any
capacity and then also like the last one
over there in back in your home screen
is the prompt generator honestly it's
just a custom GPT that we've built using
dozens of our really high performing
prompts so you can just interact with
that gbt tell it what you want the AI to
do and it spits out a prompt you copy
paste that over and you're Off to the
Races so holy smoke look at the
tremendous amount of value that you're
getting just with this membership alone
now it is a monthly cost and there are
different costs right there's one for
single account there's also one for
agency correct and is there any other
plans or is that mostly it uh the other
plan is an annual plan where you get
something like I think 30% off if you go
annual that plan actually includes the
self- selling AI snapshot if you go
monthly you'll get offered it as a Oto
on checkout but going annual you get
access to the self- selling AI snapshot
on top of everything else in here which
comes with your base level subscriptions
yeah and that's awesome so just for
anybody again that's already this is
blowing your mind wait until we install
it and we actually see this in action
but just from the beginning and all the
value that you're going to get remember
you can always click on the link below
this video that's to take you directly
to zappy chat it is my affiliate link I
only affiliate for the things I use
period so this is something that
honestly the tremendous amount of value
you're going to get for what you're
paying is completely in proportion so I
think they give you a lot for what
you're going to get so without further
Ado I mean let's do this I have an
account ready here I have my actual
original account back in the day I mean
I don't rarely use this account this is
an old school one but it is ready for
everything so where do I go how do I get
this thing going yeah so the process is
is going to look like connecting your
highl account over to app. zappy chat so
creating that connection and then
loading in the snapshot updating some
custom values there into high level and
then over in app. zappy chats creating a
bot and so let's actually start over in
app. zappy chat all right so the first
step that we're going to do is we're
going to go to app. zappy cat.net right
so just I'm sorry.com and I'm going to
put in my credentials here so this is my
credentials that I get when I purchase
zappy chat and I'm going to come right
through here put a password and I'm
going to go ahead and sign in awesome
I'm in here and what do we do next great
well and so are you logged in to the CRM
account you want to use in app.goo.gl
inside currently like using somebody
else's like what do you recommend for us
setting up the individual's account in
that point yeah so if you're in someone
else's then you can use a location type
integration with the app what we're
going to do now is do an agency type
integration which gives access to like
all the accounts and does the V2 o off
process which is why you got log in
through app. go high level but the other
piece is that you'll need the zapy chat
snapshot loaded into your account and so
you will need to get in contact with an
account admin that can load that
snapshot into your awesome so we're
definitely here and we're going to go to
our account awesome and then in here
like I said this is Legacy account so
this is perfect all right so I'm in here
and we're also going to need the
snapshot should I do that now or let's
take care of a few things in app. zappy
chat here and then we'll go over to the
snapshot on the high Lev side all right
so now we're back at app.app chat.com
and we're under for Bots okay and so
click on Integrations up at the top and
let's just go ahead and get your account
integrated so let's do high L V2 since
you're an agency admin here in your
you're logged in an app. go high Lev
this is just going to take two seconds
to go and click your agency check that
box checks the next one that enables
future installation proceed and just
like that your account is connected so
Bingo Bongo next click on account down
at the bottom left and we're going to
grab some custom JavaScript there that
we're going to drop into your agency
settings
so before we move on right Andrew so
really quickly if I was a standard user
meaning under somebody else's CRM that
has zappy chat what I would do is I
would come into Integrations and I'm
going to select the first one right in
here yeah so you would connect there and
toggle to the location type and then you
can add the location from there don't
click update there just because it'll
switch you over to V1 stay on V2 for now
yeah but if that's the case they would
do this they would do that particular
part and hit location and then right
after that we going to go to account and
we're putting this in the agency side
right yep and so this is going to bring
in the bot icon up into the top menu of
the highle account so that you or your
clients can manage their FAQs and manage
their bot directly from high level here
so I'm gonna go back to my agency view
which is what we did now and then from
here what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go over to settings in settings I'm
going to go over to company and then in
company I'm going to go all the way to
the bottom I mean obviously it doesn't
matter where we put it right right and
so just paste it in and then SC scroll
down and click update down there and
agree to the
uh go yep and we're good to go cool
awesome and so now that we've done that
we established the connection between
highle and app. zabby chat and we loaded
in the widget there and so now click on
locations and FAQs on the left side here
and we should see um let's see can you
click refresh sub accounts up at the top
right and we should see your existing
sub accounts from your agency might take
a minute since it's the first time
loading and I'm not sure how many sub
accounts you have in your old AG see
here a few doing all right cool so yeah
so now everything's loaded in here and
from this screen you can manage your
FAQs for a given sub account but you can
also do it from the sub account over in
High Level so yeah if you click that
faq's icon there it's going to load in
your FAQ database for that sub account
and so in here you can see you can
manually add you could edit if they
exist so you can export a CSV or import
a CSV search through it and then the
last piece is you can actually scrape a
URL to have the AI generate its own FAQs
and so if you want to do that for the
account we're going to set up that would
be a great go ahead and um AI to work on
generating its FAQs
there and it's me it's my
site yeah grab that URL there and you
know I'm not used to walking people
through who are so knowledgeable and
comfortable with high level already so
I'm sorry if I talk over you while
you're trying to oh no no no by all
means and that's the whole point right
for anybody that's watching right like
obviously we're doing an agency setup
versus an account setup we'll do an
account setup at you know at some point
here but that's what we're kind of
moving into now so for instance if I was
installing this for one of my clients
either I would have to do this for my
client if I'm the agency correct you
could or you can have your client do the
FAQs and scrape the website directly
from the highle sub account and so so
like go back over to your your y label
high level and let's head over to
digital voltage and go ahead and do a
hard Refresh on this page just because
we might need to refresh in order for
that custom JavaScript to load in so now
up at the top right you see you got
friendly Little Robot guy if you click
him there this same screen loads up
directly in the sub account so
this you can do it yourself from App
zappy chat or from in here or you can
direct your client to say like hey you
know maybe they have a CSV of FAQs
already just load it in right here or
like script your website you can always
come here to review your FAQs edit
things add in new ones if you want to
give the bot new information
so all that's accessible to your client
and to your team so you recommend a CSV
file or is that better like questions on
one side and like answers on another or
would a word doc work or in order to
import it in here it does need to be in
a CSV so one column of questions one
column of answers that's just how the
system works here for loading it in just
in the same way that you would load in
contacts into high level or something
like that all right so I'm gonna
actually for anybody that's here just to
make it super sweet like I mean
obviously we would do a CSV file to get
it very complex order but for here I'm
just going to scrape my site because I
have it up already I put it in here
under the parent URL and then I'm going
to add not replace and I'm gonna
basically hit submit yep very very this
will take a minute to put in the request
and then it'll take up to five minutes
to generate FAQs depending on your site
it could be 10 FAQs it could be a
thousand FAQs so it's going to process
through and generate what it sees as
relevant there obviously much like any
other AI tool it's not always going to
be perfect in like the FAQs it generates
so I typically recommend testing out the
conversation or reviewing the FAQs in
there to just make sure that everything
looks as you expected yeah absolutely so
we can leave that processing and while
that's generating let's go ahead and
create our first bot so click bots on
the left
side and yeah go and click get started
or continue and we can create our first
bot so you know do we want to create a
booking bot here or do you want to yeah
i' like to create a booking bu for my
coaching services so that will be the
majority of it it goes along with the
site because that's what that site does
awesome yeah so click that first drop
down and you'll have options for
different types of bots just to run
through these really briefly Live Chat
is the type of Bot that creates an
actual live chat widget completely
independent of high level and that can
be either booking or non- booking a
booking bot has the ability to book onto
either a highle calendar or a cly
calendar a non- booking bot does not
have the ability to book a qualification
bot can run through a series of
qualification questions and then lastly
an assistant is a way to use open ai's
Assistant API which is a different model
of connecting to open ai's backend but
the simplest and best way to go about
booking here is just click on booking
and create a booking type bot and so up
at the top right you can name your Bot
this is just internal so it's not
actually gonna you know you might want
to name it something cute like Jill but
it's not actually okay got it got it no
no no I'm saying I'm saying DVM booking
bot is better it's not going to
reference the name in its actual convers
oh got it I was like yeah it would be
kind of weird but all right yeah yeah no
I'm just saying like sometimes people
put the name in here and they're like
thei isn't saying its name it's like
well that's just the internal name of
the bot uh so anyway the description is
just for internal purposes so you can
leave it blank or you can also say
booking bot or dbm for coaching yeah for
dbm coaching so just internal notes Here
for calendar type click that drop down
and let's select high level if you did
want to do cly instead you know we run
into business owners who are attached to
their cly and don't want to give it up
yeah and so well if you do that it'll
prompt you to do an authentication to
log into the calendly there and create
that connection but we'll just stick to
high level here for now GPT model over
here we can leave it on 3.5 zappy chat
that runs all the cost through zappy
chat so there's no marginal cost at all
but if you want to use one of the other
models if you want to use like 40 as the
latest model then it'll require your
open AI API key copied and pasted in
here yeah for the samples I mean I'm
just going to click on this real quick
and I would put my API key very simple
for people that don't know how to get
open API we'll you know there's separate
videos on the channel that can show you
how to do that but for now we'll just
use a zappy chat just kind of move it
along so awesome and so if we wanted to
we could totally just click add and be
done with it and say hey there's our
first bot easy peasy but I'll show you
what's in the advanced settings here
just so we can walk through those as
well down here in the advanced settings
The Prompt type and intro message type
this is set up to work seamlessly with
our snapshot and so that's part of the
reason that we hide it in the advanced
settings here is that the vast majority
of use cases it doesn't make sense to
change this but if you know you want to
click on one of those drop downs we use
the custom field because that gives it
that sort of infinite customizability
where it can be a slightly different
prompt for Nuno than it is for Andrew
than it is for Bob Dick and Harry but if
you wanted to use a custom value instead
of a custom field and just customize it
on a per location basis that's an option
and if you want to use hardcoded text
where you actually have the prompt live
here in the app you could use that as
well but once more those are only very
Fringe cases where that makes sense we
always recommend using custom field and
leaving those options as is okay so
we're going to use custom field because
we are going to download the snapshot
it's going to be critical because that's
honestly like I've seen it it's pretty
amazing kind of pointless to like not
use it so all right then we have
anything else here as far as no once
more the only reason you would change
those are Fringe use cases and just
customization that customers have
requested and so we built it in there
but once more I just don't recommend
playing with it like just use it with a
snapshot it's great and so the rest of
the options down here at the bottom you
could adjust the temperature of the AI
the higher that number is the more
creative and loose it's allowed to be
like if you drag that slider all the way
up you're going to get just random
strings of text so not recommended to do
that point three is kind of The Sweet
Spot that we leave it at but we have had
some customers who prefer to drag it
down lower to keep it more sort of rigid
in its responses so you have
customization there if you want once
more leave it on the standard and you're
fine conversation limit if you want to
limit how many messages the AI can send
in a given conversation you can put on a
waiting delay if you want it to delay
its messaging longer if you don't want
it to respond as quickly you can toggle
between the time zone to communicate in
the contacts time zone or the locations
time zone and so if you have contact
time zone that means anytime a lead you
know if a lead comes in and they filled
out a form in their EST it's going to
communicate those available times in EST
if they switch to PDT it's going to
communicate in PDT and go from there
time zone format like it's going to send
it as abbreviated so send EST or sorry
EDT or you can have the option to hide
it if you just don't want the time zone
in there at all and then lastly the time
format you could go 12h hour you could
go 24hour if you're outside of the US
and want that more military time zone
there awesome and then what is goal yeah
so goals here are a powerful tool that
you can use to conditionally add tags or
update custom fields or even fire web
hooks based on the conversation so this
is where if you want your AI to to say
like gather qualifying information that
is like if you want the AI to determine
what industry the lead is in and like
log that into a custom field it can do
that or if you want it to say like oh if
anyone mentions that they're just
getting started add this newbie tag or
if someone mentions they've been doing
it for more than three years add this
veteran tag and so right so let's do
that yeah let's let's do the I like that
let's do the if they've been in high
level if they're brand new to high level
let's give them the Newbie tag if
they're established we'll say
established just those two tags just so
then I can decipher so what do we do
here so go and click add a goal and
we'll select the tag type okay you're
going to want it to add a tag and so in
here we just give it the tag name so new
a high level and so over in Gold
description I would say something like
the lead is new to high level or is just
getting started with high level like
something as simple as that and so
what's going to happen on the back end
here is that as the AI is having the
conversation it's going to analyze the
conversation and say all right is the
lead new to high level are they just
getting started if they are I'm going to
add this tag new to high level and so in
the same way you know you could update a
field or even fire off a custom web hook
if you wanted to reach out to the
software's outside of high level but
yeah so let's go ahead and click add a
goal oh so you just clicked add which
just added the bot so you can go back
click the edit pencil on our all right
so let's edit that oops Yeah and click
add a goal click that white add a goal
button okay tag type again and uh we can
do the same sort of thing for
established or veteran or whatever you
want to go with there I'm simple we'll
do it that way the lead is established
veteran of high level awesome okay and
then just hit upate I and I would also
maybe just add description of high level
or ghl just knowing the way that people
communicate about this software well the
AI is super smart it doesn't always know
our like our language yeah absolutely
that's great but yeah so go ahead and
hit update and you've got yourself a bot
there awesome okay so actually before
continuing let's just quickly create a
non- booking bot as well just so once
you have a customer booked into the
appointment you have non booking bot
that's not going to mess with booking
and we'll just chat with them basically
there so which is a very big difference
if you were using like conversation AI
inste a high level it's like that one
bot does it all and it's like either
either or or so this is something I'm
personally not used to so this is pretty
cool so this is yeah so just go ahead in
dbm non- Booking bot and the booking bot
is totally capable of having those non-
booking conversations it's just cleaner
to like have it completely separated and
be like hey once my contact makes it to
this point in the conversation I don't
want it booking on the calendars anymore
or customizing uh what it goes to from
there so that's literally all we need to
do you can just click add here because
we don't need to change anything else
non booking portion cool all right so
we're just going to go ahead and hit add
yep and so now we've got two different
Bots and each one you'll notice has a
different web hook with it and so we're
going to use those in the custom values
in our snapshot that's the ultimate
Destiny here very cool yeah so basically
you know we're doing a really detailed
walk through here but the only things
you need to do are integrate your high
level copy the code over into your
custom JavaScript and then to get
started create a booking bot and a non-
booking bot and a cool thing about the
way we' built the system here is that
these booking Bots and non- booking Bots
label them DVM but you could actually
use them across dozens of clients
because we didn't customize anything in
there that's only for digital voltage
marketing a prompt and everything is
going to live over in high level in
custom values so that way you don't even
have to come back in here and create
more Bots for new clients obviously you
can and you can customize that but you
can use the same Bots for for unlimited
clients really oh wow okay so because
you're customizing in the account not
necessarily here so it's leveraging
these Bots to do pretty much everything
so one does booking one does not and
then when I go into the account that's
where the information gets pulled in
absolutely brilliant Okay cool so yeah
the next piece is we're gonna need to
load in the snapshot cool and in here
the snapshot would be yeah it's GNA be
in zappy chat AI here and so you could
either click the snapshot down below or
click quick setup I think the link is in
both of those yep so we've got the
supercharge speed the lead snapshot
that's why we logged into our app. gooh
high.com first because it allows us to
import snapshots in and again if you're
working with the agency the agency would
have the snapshot you would just request
it to have it loaded into your account
and then you would do the setup inside
your account like Andrew is going to
show us right now as you kind of go
through so we're going to go yes import
now and then we're going to physically
load this so I'm going to show you how
to load it too so we'll go into sub
accounts we're looking for our dbm
account awesome and then in here I'm
going to click on that I'm going to here
go into action load snapshot and the
snapshot name is cu you know I have
gazillions of them you type in super
it'll probably pop up awesome Yep there
it is super snapshot speed to lead
awesome and then we're going to proceed
we're just going to go ahead and import
everything and we're GNA hit boom and
thenit okay awesome so we're going to
switch over to the sub account now we're
actually in the physical account that we
just imported the snapshot every now and
again it does take a few minutes so if
we don't all the values in here just
understand that that's normal remember
we see our cool little bot That's so
exciting I don't know if did it scrape
the scrape their URL yet or let's see
was that over on the uh click over to
the other Tab and and so I think it was
positioned over there okay so get air it
out so you know what let's close this
one out and let's just do it again one
more time because I have a feeling we're
gonna need that so I'm just gonna hit my
black eye again here um at this site and
it's going to be add submit we're gonna
let that process or should we wait or
let's let that process just because it
can take up to five minutes and uh got
more to walk through more to go through
here all right so I'm just GNA duplicate
my tab here and I am G to go down and
I'm GNA go over to actually where do we
go first custom values or yeah let's go
to custom values because really in order
to use the snapshot the only thing you
need to update is custom values then
obviously you can customize from there
in terms of the workflows and how things
interact but the custom values are what
we're going to use here so it looks like
you have some custom values from
potentially an older version or maybe a
different AI provider probably an older
version but I'm assuming it's the folder
or no yep yeah the folder in here is
going to be our five custom values
awesome five that's awesome we try to
keep it simple that's great yeah and so
just like brief overview of these the
calendar ID is going to tell it which
calendar to book on to the prompt is
going to give it its General prompt like
its role goal and context reactivation
message is only if you want to use our
database reactivation snapshot or
workflow that we have in here this is
where you'd put in that like initial
reactivation message but that's an
optional feature you know if you're
running reactivations not everyone is or
you might have a different automation
already set up for it which is fine and
then the robot web Hook and the robot
web hook non- booking those are where
we're going to paste in those web hooks
from the app so all right so what we're
going to do is we're going to update the
robot web hook first all right we're
going to start with easy first so I'm
going to edit the custom value I'm going
to come directly in here I'm going to go
to zappy chat and and I'm going to do my
booking bot I'm assuming in that one oh
look there convenient copy button right
there and we're going to paste it in the
re web hook now this is for the one for
that books correct exactly yeah all
right while that's updating just want to
make sure there's no error in here still
processing okay and then now we're in
the robot web hooking non- booking I'm
going to go ahead and hit edit custom
value I'm going to go over to zappy chat
so I'm going to hit close here and I'm
going to click over here for copy for
the non- booking bot version and I'm
going to come right over here I'm going
to paste that I'm going to hit update
now I do have a specific calendar that
people can book on so I'm going to get
that calendar ID I'm going to show you
how to do that so right here right now
we're in custom values I'm actually
going to come out of custom values and
go to calendars which is right up here
and inside of calendars what we're going
to do is we're going to come over here
and it is my round robin somewhere in
here main coaching calendar somewhere in
here strategy call which we're going to
do I don't know why it's taking so long
it's a little scary the old screen share
high level equals pretty much oh no he's
like he's screaming at me there we go so
we're going to go ahead and we're going
to come in here the ID just so you guys
understand is directly under here so
we're just going to copy this all right
let copy the clipboard I'm going to head
back and I am going to go over to my
settings again I shouldn't head back but
with custom values and then in the
folders which are so awesomely organized
with the five only five custom values
that's amazing and I'm going to come in
here I'm going to hit edit I'm going to
drop it right in here and I'm going to
hit update I love being able to just to
sit back and let you roll this is great
awesome now this is where we're going to
need a little support right because some
people might have different variety of
like skills when it comes to the prompts
now do you recommend us using the AI
prompt helper that you gave us yeah
let's go let's go use the uh let's go
use the prompt generator there so view
all right so right now as you can see
I'm in the quick setup part which by the
way you'll have access to and you can go
through the setup we're trying to just
give you this live like we always
promise here we always show you
everything live so what I'm going to do
is actually use the tools that zappy
chat loves to provide
so we're going to go into the promt
generator and we're going to use their
custom GTP that they've generated just
for this so I'm going to come over here
yeah click that link below the video
awesome and so in here let's just tell
it what you want the AI to do so you can
say the AI is an assistant for digital
voltage media and they should determine
how long the user has used high level
and book appointments for a coaching
call if you want for intro call so yeah
I got you so the AI is an assistant for
Taris and digital voltage media they
specialize in highlevel coaching and
support the bot will ask some questions
to find out the level of knowledge thank
God that it doesn't really require good
spelling habits or also i' get with AI
to find the level of knowledge and
experience in high level and it will
book a 15minute discovery call to see if
they would be a good fit or coaching and
Consulting Services all right and again
everybody's service is going to be
different right we got a lot of like
local businesses that listen to this
channel we also got again thank God I
can't spell for anything but we're just
going to let the bot dude sting what's
really cool about this is is that the
fact that they even give you a prompt
writer again this is why I'm thoroughly
impressed with everything as long as the
bot decides to work there we go
searching my knowledge so zappy chat is
done and if you said you create a lot
bunch of bots we did there we go look at
this and so it's going to give you a
pretty robust prompting here and so this
also now like serves as a template for
you moving forward where you go okay
we've got kind of these like steps to a
conversation flow and I can see where oh
I can like change the sort of suggested
message I can change the tone I can
change the way like the general context
or it's like overall role at the
beginning and so just spat out a uh
pretty hefty prompt there I feel like
that's a longer version than we
typically get but you can always
interact with it back and forth to be
like hey actually I want to qualify
leads based on their credit score or I
want to discuss more of like we should
find out what Niche they're in and how
many clients they have so you can go
back and forth tweak your prompt and
change it from there and also if any of
our users ever have issues with
prompting in general I've got a bunch of
great prompt Engineers on the team who
love like working through this and so
they're always happy to review prompts
and give adjustments and edits from
there but for now yeah let's just
highlight uh yeah I'm going to say I'm
just obviously when you have some time
you want to take this very seriously you
would copy it and adjustment put in a
word doc you know yeah and it's it's
great to take that as the first start
here and to like run a test conversation
through and then from there go and be
like okay actually I wanted to use
emojis I wanted to make jokes I wanted
to use the lead's first name whatever
you personally want to do there awesome
so what we're going to do is just to
make it super simple again back in
custom values we got the prompt we
copied and pasted what we're going to
copy and now we're going to paste it so
we're going to get Ed a custom value now
I know it seems weird that you're going
to have this one little line for all
this tremendous thing but it's okay
because the bot does read it anyway so
you'll be good to go so we're just going
to hit contrl + V get it all in there
hit update and now you're going to
notice that all of a sudden our custom
value here will be pretty huge but it
has everything that you need to go to
get started which is amazing all right
cool so we're pretty much set on this
part now what's the next step The Next
Step would be to test it out and give it
a try but before doing that do you want
to take a look at just the workflows
real quick I can just give like a high
level oh absolutely absolutely so let's
go into automations and let's go into
might be an older one so hold on uh no
that AI chatbot folder is uh looks like
the one yeah was important today and so
we've got I think it's now 11 workflows
in here a lot of these are like
additional features added on like the
database reactivation and the double
message processing appointment status
updates Miss call text bag like these
are just things to set up the AI in such
a way that it can interact but really
the core of it are these like first four
workflows so basically the AI z00
Channel just sets the response channel
so that when someone responds via text
we know to respond via text when someone
replies via Facebook we know to reply
via Facebook Instagram you can even set
it up for email which you know has some
mixed results there and has some
limitations just around using high level
like in high level you can't respond
automatically within a thread it creates
a new email so it's a little clunky to
use it over email but we have some
customers successfully using it if you
want to do so but so all of that happens
in here just setting those response
channels so let me ask you question if I
wanted to like disable the email per se
because I know for a fact that it won't
work well for me so how do I just delete
it right yeah you can totally delete it
but actually you don't need to do so
this comes without the email on you can
see that in the if El's condition ah I
see it okay got it okay exactly so the
way that we do it is we have a custom
field called response Channel and
anytime someone replies we update that
channel and so the workflow later on
that sends the message checks that and
sends it accordingly so right now you
know if you and I are texting back and
forth and the AI is responding over text
and in the meantime you send an email we
don't want the AI to then try to send an
email right now because we don't have it
on for email so long story short no
action needed it's set to work on these
channels but if you did want to say turn
off Facebook you could go and delete
that update response Channel step under
the FB path so down here yeah so any of
those that you delete it essentially
just removes the AI from being able to
respond on that channel very very cool
and then send message to AI is the next
one right yeah so this is where we
trigger off those web hooks so when
someone replies we trigger off a web
hook over to the AI to generate a
response and so you can see that there's
a booking path and a non- booking path
and then under the booking path we
actually have it automatically set up to
supplementally gather the name if the
name is empty gather phone and email if
those are empty or if all info is
provided just Cruise right through just
knowing that we're going through this
booking path here if we're booking we
want to get the phone and the email
before booking so that's all bit into
the snapshot right here absolutely
awesome right so all this is already
pretty much done great and then 1B is
just specifically for the live chat
Channel just to help with Gathering the
name and just kind of a simplified
streamline for that specific Channel and
so functions similarly but it's just a
simpler version here for live chat and
then workflow two is how we actually
send the response back to the contact
and so in workflow 2 here just basically
the AI when it generates a response it
adds the response tag comes through here
and you can see all these different
channels set up so based on that field
that was updated in aoo sensor response
there and appropriately rolls from that
and again if I don't have the first
initial one set up for Facebook I don't
have to come in here and change this one
because this is only if the first part
was set up then this one would respond
back but if the first part is not set up
like if I turned on Facebook Messenger
this would never activate correct you
got it awesome so really the only one we
really have to like think about is
logically is this response channel is
this sure I have the response channels I
wanted to respond to and then the rest
is pretty much in the back yeah and then
when we talk about like creating complex
systems where you want the AI to book
onto multiple different calendars based
on criteria you just apply the sort of
workflow logic to ai1 that's where you
can really customize and build some like
really intense systems and we you know
people like yourself and me like really
enjoy that but for folks who don't want
to get into that you can just use the
snapshot as is and what it's going to do
is for New Leads it's going to work on
booking them into an appointment once
it's booked it's going to be just a
conversational bot to answer any
questions and respond in a quick kind
and thorough way there cool and the
appointment confirmations and reminders
I already have some already now do I
want to maybe turn those off or how does
that work so in here if you scroll down
a little bit in this workflow this sends
a confirmation message on the
appropriate channel so if you scroll
down to like the if else condition and
it also just like cleans up tags removes
from workflows Etc and so sends the
confirmation message on that appropriate
Channel and then if you go over to the
right a little bit you'll see that's
where the actual reminders start and so
you can just delete that email
confirmation and everything else below
it and so if you click that first email
confirmation there and delete that step
those are internal notifications which
you can remove those as well if you want
but yeah you can delete all actions from
there and that's if I already have my
appointment confirmations all set for
whatever exactly yeah if you're using
another snapshot that already has
appointment confirmations we just had
enough people starting from scratch that
didn't have that already and so that is
baked in here and it's just easier to
delete than it is to manually go back in
and add yeah absolutely okay cool and
then anything else like as far as that
so we have the appointment what about
the alert user anything else like here
just notable mention like I said we
don't want to get too crazy into it yeah
so like alert user comes off but if you
in part because that is an alert set up
to send an internal notification when
the bot fails and so you could turn that
on and you can also add in your white
label domain so it sends a link directly
to the contact in the case that the bot
fails or yeah it's just like as a
fallback there like the fallback
workflow adds that tag in the event of a
bot failing stop bot tag that is there
to be able to shut off the bot for any
given contact by adding a tag stop robot
follow-up you can actually set up the AI
to reach back out if someone falls off
in the middle of a conversation so say
you want to set it to like if the lead
doesn't respond after 20 minutes or
after 45 minutes send a dynamic followup
and so they I will look at the past
conversation and actually reference that
and oh we're going to turn that on that
sounds cool cool so this one will take a
little additional uh setup within here
and so got it turned on which is great
scroll down a little bit and So
currently it's set to 45 minutes that an
appropriate weit time for you or would
you absolutely longer great and then
let's click on the uh follow-up web hook
there at 45 minutes and so this is one
of our web hooks here and so in order to
use this feature you would need to copy
and paste your highle location API key
into that location key field and also
your open AI API key into that field all
right so obviously we might have to go
back and do that but because we don't
have that here and that's going to make
this video basically yeah but basically
like you provide it your keys there and
then you give it the prompt in that
prompt field above and so you'll see the
one that we have in there is just like
you've sent a message but Nuno hasn't
responded in 45 minutes send a
re-engaging message like did I lose you
or are you still there and I think looks
like it says like response should be no
more than more than two SS long yeah
just to like keep it short and so you
can customize it there where it's like
if you want to have it re-engage in a
different way maybe you want to like
drop a specific offer or maybe you want
to encourage the AI to highlight how
your Marketing Solutions will be perfect
for their specific situation so that way
it can like reference back in the
conversation and follow up like that
very very cool and so you can obviously
fire off that web hook as many times as
you want create as many conditions as
you want nerd out on that as much as you
want yeah very cool yeah there's
definitely going to be a lot of nerding
out I can tell you that much well
without further Ado let's see this thing
in action how can I uh I start engaging
with it so at this point if you want to
test your um sorry text that's the word
my Brand's looking for if you want to
text your toio number here uh it should
kick on and engage all right so I am
going to use my phones in here so give
us a second right so I'm going to find
my number which is always funny because
I never find and that number will get
blurred out so obviously you guys can
spam me like some people like to do so I
am going to text this number just give
me two seconds I'll just read off what
the bot is saying and I'm just going to
type in hello
okay and I believe I typed the right
number looks right kcks on here oh here
we go hi I'm here to assist you with any
questions or scheduling needs you may
have how can I help you today need help
with high level yeah and so from here
the AI will have the conversation
according to its prompt and be able to
reference any FAQs on that piece and
move it towards since we selected a
booking type bot it's going to move
towards booking that appointment and
rolling through there oh here it is
right here so we can see a live in
action there we go all right to better
sist you could you please tell me about
your Cent experience knowledge high
level so it's asking that kind of newbie
question I am
new all right I have no experience
whatsoever so guys you are seeing this
live and again this is what's super
exciting now this will work with
Facebook Messenger this will work with
your website chat widget that you can
install on your website this will work
with Instagram and all those other
things great here has you new high level
could you share your primary goals in
seeking coaching and specific challenges
you're currently facing just need
someone to help me understand the basics
yeah and so it's currently using like
some of those example phrases that came
in that prompt generated off of The
Prompt generator and so it's like if
you're going okay this currently sounds
like a little too buttoned up in
professional like I maybe want it looser
then you can go in and change that
language or you can give it like
defining role characteristics where it's
like laidback and casual or buttoned up
and professional you know you can change
yeah you can play around with it so this
is pretty cool would it be interesting
yeah sure now I'm using not yet I'm
trying to be as vague as possible to see
how much the bot is going to P yeah yeah
I mean like it's funny back in the
dialogue flow days a customer was doing
a live demo and it was like four lawyers
and they responded with like yuppers
like y u p p RS and luckily we had
loaded that phrase in there but like at
the time if we hadn't the AI likely
would have failed so our client was like
texting me directly and was like oh crap
he said yuppers like is it gonna that I
was we got good news for you man that
was on our list
that's pretty awesome but like Chad gbt
is so much more just robust in its
ability and the different large language
models like and we're going to open up
the um Google Gemini brain into zappy
chat as well just to continue to expand
the options for using different brains
with the AI and for the different
experiences there because while open AI
has definitely been in the lead ever
since January of last year and when I
really bust on the scene with chat gbt
we're not counting out any other
providers and want to continue to give
flexibility in the future here moving
cool yeah I have hopes for Gemini I
think it's catching up pretty quickly
but uh yeah yeah just like the resources
behind are great so yeah I went ahead
and awesome look at this there yeah and
so since you already have a confirmation
in there oh and it looks like you got an
internal notification to yourself as
well yeah so but but literally honestly
everything that I was supposed to do it
Beyond did that and even created an
opportunity in my sales pipeline which
again is part of my automation that I
originally had this is so freaking
badass it took like about 45 minutes it
was a lot of dialog right because we
wanted to take our time and explaining
what was happening we did so really
about 30 minutes to set this up at the
agency level which is pretty darn
remarkable and you have yourself a GTP
and again we went so incredibly basic
just to get something up and running
quickly and as you can see there are
snapshots there are demo snapshots
there's all these cool things you can do
so this is like absolutely next level in
the things that we're doing so got blown
away and I think that this is pretty
cool like and I honestly I'm even more
excited so what we're going to do is
like again for anybody that's interested
you have the link below we want to make
sure that you guys take full advantage
of this this is absolutely amazing like
again we've tried conversational AI
we've tried a lot of them out there
they've been around for close to four
years doing this they've went through
the ringer they did it before was
actually AI as you could see it live the
setup was as bad as simple as it can get
and the fact that you're able to do a
non- booking with the booking bot look
how simple we made it and look already
the results that is my time that is my
automation that fired there were no
hiccups you guys saw it live and we did
it completely raw which means there was
no practice Andrew and I didn't practice
for 7 hours we literally jumped on a
call as of today to try to show you this
outstanding product So for anybody
that's out there that's interested if
you want to book your own demo for this
booket you know they have tons of
resources out there and we're going to
be coming back because we're going to
show you how to use the live agents in
another video because that's where you
can put basically web Bots anywhere and
you can make a business out of it where
you could basically design live chat
Bots for people and put it on their
sites and that is another function that
just comes with zappy chat so we're H
going to be super excited to bring you
that next so thank you for watching
we'll see you in the next one
