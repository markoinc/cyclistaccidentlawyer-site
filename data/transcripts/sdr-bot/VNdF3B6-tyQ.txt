If you're looking to build your own AI
voice agent, this will be the easiest
video you'll find on the entire
internet. Today, I'm going to show you
how to build one in less than 10 minutes
using Vappy, which is the cheapest and
one of the highest quality sounding ones
in the market right now. So, I don't
need to make this intro longer than it
needs to be. Just stick with me for
literally 10 minutes and you'll have a
skill up your sleeve of building AI
voice agents which you can sell for
thousands of dollars. Let's jump
straight into it. Without further ado,
let's dive into it. We are going to be
using Vappy. If you've never heard of
Vapy, it is just a voice AI for
developers. As you can see, it lets you
build agents, test, and deploy them in
minutes. Like, it's very, very easy. Um,
however, I'm going to be showing you how
to integrate it into make.com and go
level. Um, so it would automatically
call leads 24/7 whenever you want. Um,
and move them through the pipeline. So,
the first thing you're going to do is
head over to vap.ai and you're going to
sign up for free. And that is the best
part about this. You literally get all
of um yeah, all of this for free. You
only pay per minute you use. Um and even
then it's the cheapest in the market
right now, I think. So um once you log
in, you will see um four things at the
top. You'll have an overview, you'll
have platform, voice, logs, and then
down here. If you click on your name,
you'll find settings, your API keys, and
things like that. So I'm just showing
you the uh the UI and how how it looks.
Now, I'm aware that new softwares when
you use them, they always look way more
confusing than they actually are. Like
when you first log into High Level, it
looks confusing, but once you get to
know the platform, it's actually really
easy. Same with make.com and any other
softwares that you use. So, just to show
you what you can do. Um, if you click on
platform, you'll see that you have
assistance, phone numbers, files, tools,
blocks, squads. You don't really need to
use all of these. You can then head over
to phone numbers and you can either buy
a phone number or you can import a phone
number. So, as you can see, I've already
got one right here with a Florida
country code um being 561, I believe.
And it's very easy. So, if you don't
have a phone number in Twilio, you can
just buy one right here. And the best
part about this is you don't actually
need to get it verified. It
automatically does it, I think. So, it's
super sick because if you're familiar
with God level or any other Yeah. form
of buying phone numbers online, you'll
know that it usually takes days if not
weeks to verify phone number. Whereas
this is instant like I bought one
yesterday and it's working. So um for
the area code, obviously you can choose
whatever state you want. Um I just chose
Florida. I didn't even know the area
code. I just went on to Google and
searched for Florida area code and it g
it gave me it. So that's how you can get
your area code and then you just click
buy. It's as simple as that. Um I
believe right now it can do US and
Canada. Um, but you can call leads from
anywhere in the world, which I'll show
you in a second. Um, so that's the first
way, which is the easiest way. Just buy
a phone number. If you already have a
phone number verified in Twilio, then
what you can do is click on import, and
you can very easily just import it by
putting in your Twilio phone number,
your account SID, your Twilio off token,
and then label, and then just import,
and it'll do it automatically. So, those
are the two ways you get phone numbers.
I recommend just buying one if you
haven't used Twilio before. It's super
simple. Um, and it can be done in 30
seconds. Create a new assistant. You can
see that I've already got one right here
with all the prompts. And I'll give you
the prompts and a good knowledge base in
a second. But to create a new assistant,
this is what it'd be like for you. You
would click on it. You would call the
assistant whatever you want. So, you
could just call it like, I don't know,
real estate outbound caller or something
like that. Doesn't really matter. Yeah,
it can be adjusted after you create it
anyway. and then just click create
assistant. And once you click on that,
you can see that it will look something
like this. And as you can see, just in
terms of the features, we've got the
model. So this is kind of like the
details that you want the AI agent to
have. So it's as simple as I can explain
it as I just did. Um, so it's got your
prompt, it's got um the first message
you want it to say when it calls the
leads. Um, you've got the transcriber,
you've got the voice. So, I'm actually
going to show you how you can import
your own voice into here. So, it's going
to be super awesome. Um, you've got
functions, which are the tools. You can
see that I've already created some, but
you don't need this as of now. Um,
advanced. I think you've got the URL
down here. So, server URL, but once
again, you don't need to focus at this
right now because we're just going to be
building the the model. So if we go back
to model which is here this is the first
message you want to give the AI calling
assistant to say right and just before
we get into that let's put the model as
mini cluster so for mini cluster that's
going to save you a bit you can see it's
gone to 9 cents per minute which is
awesome um for the knowledge base I
recommend uploading some information
about your business you can very easily
just put it onto a Google document and
then download that as a PDF upload it to
um here and it will do it basically. So
that's really amazing. Um another thing
you can do is you can actually just
search for like if you search for like
commi um sales calling script you can
see that you could very easily just
download his entire like script and then
upload that as a knowledge base right
here just by selecting a file. You can
see that I've actually got it right
here. Um or any other script you want it
to follow. So, you can even go into the
classroom in school and you can look at
the cold calling script we have in there
and the sales script and you can build
your own. I recommend following Jeremy
Miner's NEPQ. Um, it's just a way of
selling basically where you get the
prospect to answer a few questions
first, build up a motion, and then book
them in for an appointment. Um, but
nonetheless, you can very easily just
put your script that you want on a
Google document and then upload it as a
knowledge base. And that's one way to do
it. And you can also I recommend doing
your um your own knowledge base of your
own company or offer, right? Because you
need the AI to know what you're selling.
So obviously the more input you give it,
the better. For this system prompt, let
me just show you what um my one looks
like up here. You can see that um I say
something like, "Hello, this is Charlie
from agency start. How can I assist you
today?" Um and then for the system
prompt, you'd want something like this.
You are a voice assistant for Charlie.
You're going to be doing cold call to
sell the program. Remember to use their
name which is contact ID. This will make
sense in a second. Um you are asked you
so you are tasked with answering
questions about the business, booking
appointments. Um if they wish to book an
appointment, your goal is to gather
necessary information from callers in a
friendly and efficient manner. So ask
for their name, ask for the purpose of
their appointment. Um request their
preferred date. Um so you know we're
just telling it things that we want. So
we want it to act normal. We want it to
say things like um and well to otherwise
it's going to be too robotic, right? So
you want to actually include this. Um so
this is a good prompt. I've already put
this below um the video so you can copy
and paste this if you want. Um but yeah,
very simple. Um hopefully that makes
sense. But obviously you can change this
for whatever you want it to say first
and foremost. So you can say um hey is
this the owner of company name? And you
can actually have that as a variable. So
it will say the company name that you
do. Um, so that's really cool. For
temperature, I recommend just keeping it
at one. Max tokens 250 is fine. You can
leave this the same. Just make sure you
change the model to GPT40 mini cluster
and you should be good to go. So
hopefully this is making sense. This is
just the script and where you change it.
It's as simple as that. Um, for the
voice, um, let me quickly show you how
you can import your own voice. But to do
this, all you're going to do, I believe,
is connect your um 11 Labs account. So,
this is optional. You can obviously have
a voice like um Jesse or um if you were
to choose like the ones inside um Vappy,
that's totally fine. This is just if you
want to clone your client's voice or
your own voice, you would do this as I'm
about to show you. So, I believe you go
to here, go to settings. It was just in
provider settings. So you would click on
here and you go to provider credentials
and then you basically just put in your
11 Labs API. So that's as simple as I
can explain it. And to get your 11 Labs
um API, you would just simply go to 11
Labs. And this is completely optional.
This is just if you want your own voice
as mentioned before. Um so yeah, you
would click on my workspace, click on
API keys, and you'll basically find it.
And then you just put it in right here
and then click save. And then once
you've done that, um you can then go
back to assistance, go to voice, and you
should be able to select your own voice.
Obviously, you'd need to get your voice
in the actual um thing. So, I believe
you go to voiceover studio and you yeah,
create your own voice basically, but you
can search on YouTube how to create your
own voice on 11 Labs. Once you've done
that though, you would just follow what
I showed you. Um and then you can select
your own voice here. The in voice
library, you can actually see. So if we
let this play, in the middle of every
difficulty lies opportunity. So you can
see that actually sounds like me. Um, so
that is how you build an assistant and
how you connect 11 Labs with your own
voice to it. We're going to be talking
with the assistant that we've built, eg
myself because it's my own voice we're
going to be talking to. Um, but then I'm
going to show you how to actually do
calls inside Vappy in case you wanted
the easiest way just to start calling
leads yourself. Um, and then in the next
following videos, I'm going to show you
how to integrate it into goal level
throughmake.com. And that's also going
to be really simple, but we're just
gradually increasing the level of
difficulty as we go. So, if we click on
talk of assistance, it it's as easy as
that. You can literally click on it and
let's turn this up so you can hear. It's
going to call. Hello, this is Charlie
from Agency Start. How can I assist you
today? Yeah, great. I was wondering what
about what you do?
Well, we're all about helping businesses
grow and crush their goals. We offer
awesome resources and support to get you
where you want to be. So, what's cooking
in your world? What challenges are you
facing? Um, I'm struggling getting
appointments.
Um, I totally get that setting
appointments can feel like hurting cats
sometimes. Our program actually helps
turn those lukewarm leads into actual
appointments like magic. Want to chat
about how we can tackle that? Yeah,
absolutely.
Awesome. So, let's turn that around,
shall we? I mean, we've got this killer
organic strategy to help you get
appointments from those lukewarm leads
without breaking a sweat. Can I grab
your name to dive a little deeper?
Charlie.
Hey there. So, I just need your full
name to kick things off. What's your
name? Charlie Barber.
Hey, Charlie Barber. So, what motivated
you to reach out today? Are you looking
to tackle getting more? Okay, we'll end
it there because I don't want to talk
all day on it, but you can see that it's
it's pretty solid and obviously you can
change the tonality. Um, yeah, you can
change the actual voice, the visibility,
the clarity, all of this stuff. So, you
can play around with it. And if you go
into cool logs, I believe you can do
that in um God, I got to remember where
everything is. Yeah, in logs and then
call. Yeah, I recommend talking with it,
changing the prompt, making your script
different, things like that. Um, and in
terms of if you just want to start
calling leads like straight away inside
Vappy, um, all you need to do is click
on phone numbers to here and you can
basically, yeah, just put in whoever you
want to call. So, let's say you wanted
to call someone in the United States.
You would just put their phone number as
like the prospect, select the assistant
you want. So, you can see here that
we've got my caller. Um, this was the
one that we tried building, but I didn't
want to have to build the entire prompt,
but you get you guys get the point. So,
you select the assistant. Simple as
that. Um, so once you do that, like if I
just put in my number quickly, just give
it a
second. You can see that I am actually
getting a call right now. You can see
here that I'm getting a call. If I pick
up,
hello, this is Charlie from Agency Star.
How can I assist you today, Ben? Yeah,
great. How are you?
I'm doing great. No complaints over
here. So, I'm just calling to chat about
your company and see how we might be
able to help with Okay. So, I ended it,
but that's how you would call these.
Right. Very simple. Um, and that was
from my Florida phone number all the way
to UK, right? Very simple. You can put
whoever you want to call right here and
you can call using AI, right? Okay. So,
we're inside make.com and we're about to
take it up a level. So, obviously I will
provide you guys in the community with
this blueprint. So, you don't have to
build this. You can just copy and paste
it into your own freemake.com account
really easily with one click of a
button. And you would go down to these
three dots right here, and you would
click import. Now, once you click
import, you would choose the file you
just downloaded, which will be below
this post. And you'll basically just
click it, click save, and it will
populate just like this. And once you
see it inside your make.com account like
this, um, all you need to do is just
change a few things. So obviously this
will be blank um and you won't have it
connected. So all you'll need to do is
just click add. You don't need IP
restrictions. Just click save. And
you'll notice how you'll get a URL like
this. Right. And this is your yeah web
hook URL. And this will become really
important in a second. So I need you to
focus. So that's the first thing we're
going to do is just yeah click save. And
you can call it whatever you want. So,
we could call this
um web
hook for GHL or something. Doesn't
really matter to be honest. And you can
see that you get a URL basically. So, do
that. Click save because you constantly
want to be saving this. And then you'd
go to this variable section right here.
And once again, this won't be like this.
You'll see it and it'll be blank
probably. So, just click add. You can
keep this blank. Click save. Um, but I
believe it should be, yeah, if you go,
it should be how I've got it here. Um,
and then for contact ID. But once you
click on it, you'll get options like
this. Um, which will all make sense in a
second. Um, and this won't actually show
the gray numbers here. Um, but it will
in a second after we So, this is just
all the information from the goal level,
which is how we're going to get it to
call
automatically. So, click okay. Save it.
constantly be saving us. Um, and then
for this Vappy call, this is um, just a
thing you need to really pay attention
to. So, you've got the URL, you've got
method, which is post. So, this will be
how it is in your one. You want to get
your your key. Um, either private or
public, I think, should work, but you
can always test both. Um, so once you've
done that, let's scroll down. And you'll
see that it will look something like
this. And all you need to do is I think
this should be the same. Um and then
this should be your phone number. This
is giving Vappy information to be able
to call your go high level phone
numbers. So save that and yeah that's
perfect. So um in the next video we're
going to be going into high level and
just building a really quick automation
and then that's all that you need to do.
So after the next video, we're going to
be um testing it and just like that,
it's as simple as that. Like there's a
lot of confusing videos out there. I
want to make this really easy. So yeah,
make sure to watch the next video where
you're going to be building it in high
level. And yeah, take it easy and have
an amazing day. Okay, perfect. So now we
are inside go level. Um just in case you
don't know how to get into an
automation, you would just go um yeah to
automations in your sub account and you
would create a new workflow. start from
scratch. And that is how you would start
this. Um, so now let me walk you through
how you would actually build this very
easily. You're just going to follow me
step by step. The first thing we're
going to add is a drip. So this will
make sense in a second. Um, and we're
going to put the drip as 1 second and
it's going to do this every minute. So
the reason we want this is because you
can do like multiple calls using the
Vappy um agent inside Vappy. Um, but to
be honest, we want to keep it as like
safe as possible. So, it's just going to
do one call every minute. Um, and that's
what we want to do personally. So,
that's why we have a drip mode instead
of just like if you were to upload a
bunch of leads in here. Um, then you can
see how it would start to be a problem.
So, um, yeah, that's the first thing.
Second thing is going to be a web hook.
Um, so if we actually go back to the
other one, let's not save that. Uh, let
me show you what it looks like inside my
one. So you can you can name it whatever
you want by the way, but you can see
that we have the same thing here of drip
mode. We've got batch size one. So it's
the same thing. We've got the web hook
method is going to be post and then URL
is going to be the URL that you got from
here. So just copy that address into
make.com and you can see that it should
just be the same one. So yeah, you can
see that you get it right here. Um, and
then that's all that's needed to do. So
save that. Then you need to this this is
optional. Um, but this makes sense for
if you want to have a pipeline. So I
would highly recommend doing that. And
you upload a file and you actually
upload a file. Um, you can add a tag and
a tag keeps the contacts organized. So
if you upload leads who are like cold
leads, you want a tag saying like cold
leads, right? You want to keep them
organized compared to if you were to
upload warm leads. You wouldn't know
who's who. So always use tags. That's
super important. And then the trigger to
start this workflow to start calling
leads every minute on autopilot would be
contact tag added. So, just like what I
said, you would upload leads into your
contacts. And you do this after you've
built this and published it obviously
because it needs to be published for it
to work. But you would upload leads, you
would add them as a tag, which could be
whatever you want. And then that this
would be the trigger. So tag added and
it would be like um cold leads, right?
As an example. Um so that's how you
would start this automation, but you
could also start it from a form being
submitted. So if your clients or you run
like Facebook ads and you're getting
leads opt in that could be the trigger
where it could even like wait. So if we
go here it could I mean the trigger
could be form submitted. It could
literally be anything. You can see how
many different things you could do but
form is and then you just select the
form that they submit. So if someone
signs up to like a webinar you could
call them and or someone books an
appointment you could call them increase
your shut rate so forth. Um,
and yeah, that could be the trigger. And
then you could even wait like, I don't
know, five minutes or four minutes to
make it a bit more human. Um, I don't
recommend doing more than five because
you want to call leads as soon as
possible. Um, but then it's obviously
going to do one. It's going to yeah,
it's got the web hook. So, this
basically tells um high level
aboutmake.com and vice versa. And then
it's going to remove them from the tag
being not called yet. So that's just in
case you added them into your CRM with
the tag like cold leads not called yet
and then it's going to add them as a tag
being called once. So you can experiment
with tags but the most important thing
are these two things right here. So yeah
and then obviously having a trigger for
how you want the automation to start
which can be outbound directly it can be
inbound it's whatever you want it to be.
So okay so now we can actually do the
fun part which is going to be testing
this automation. So all you're going to
do is click run once and you can see
that it's going to be waiting for a web
hook. So all we need to do is come into
our girl level automation you should
have built by now and just click on test
workflow and then you're going to select
a contact. So just make sure you upload
yourself as a contact in the contact
section of your sub account. And then
you can search for your name or it could
be a test or whatever but you click on
it and then run test. And if we go back
to make, you can see that it's going to
go directly across and it should just
call my phone number. Um, so if you give
it a second, you can see that it's done
it. And if we wait a second, you can see
that I am receiving a call, which is
amazing. And it's as simple as that. So,
it's actually super simple. You can see
that it's from Florida. And if we pick
it up, hello, this is Charlie from
Agency Start. How can I assist you
today? Yeah, I hope you're having an
amazing day. I was wondering what you
sell. You know, it's all about building
value and getting those potential
clients to take action. Pretty neat,
right? Yeah, it's amazing. How do I book
an appointment? Okay, so as you can see,
it's that easy. And if you want to
publish this automation, just make sure
that you have scheduling turned on and
it's going to be immediately as data
arrives because once you turn this on,
it's going to be running 24/7. and then
make sure you have your automation
turned on as published. And from that
point on, you're good to go. So, all you
need to do is just add a trigger for how
you want this um thing to work. And it's
as easy as that. I do recommend going
into the classroom and learning how to
build a pipeline because obviously once
you've called the lead, it can move them
through the pipeline into a different
section and you can really get more
advanced from that point on. Um, but
this was a really easy and quick
demonstration of how you would use Vappy
to do outbound calls um for whoever you
want, whenever you want, 247. So,
hopefully you enjoyed and I'll catch you
in the next one.
