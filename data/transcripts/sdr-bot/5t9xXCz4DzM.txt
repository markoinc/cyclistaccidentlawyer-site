Hi guys welcome to another AI Automation related video and in this video I'm going to show you guys
how you can create an AI Automation which will help you a lot in sales. So if you are working
in a tech company or any company where you are supposed to call your clients via google meet
and have multiple sales meeting this automation will help you a lot because in this automation
I'm going to teach you guys how you can add an AI tool which will take notes while you are in the
meeting and automatically save follow-up messages in your google drive based on those meetings. So
let's say you are having like 8 to 10 meetings a day and after a week you don't really remember
if you needed to follow up for any of your client if you needed to send an email this AI automation
will help you do that it is going to automatically add into your google meeting and it will prepare
follow-up messages for you if you had taken previous interactions with the same person
right so pretty simple automation free workflow available in the description as well and that is
an intent workflow so as you can see it is going to trigger whenever you add a new appointment in
your google calendar so that's the test data where you can see that it's adding all of the data when
a new google meeting event is created now it is going to save the guest email so that's the
guest email and then it will make an API call to Fireflies now Fireflies is a really nice tool
which is used to take notes whenever you are doing meetings so it's just gonna capture everything
in your meeting so you can simply add to your live meeting you can upload audio video start
recording there's a lot of features in this tool available which you can use for free and i've been
using that and it helped me a lot because it will save the transcript of the meeting so if i go to
meetings you can see that's the simple meeting which i have saved if i click on that it has all
of the records saved right we it also saved the recording and good thing about that they give you
API access so if i go to settings and then if i go to developer settings you have this API key
and what we will do in this Enerton workflow is that we will make an API call to Fireflies and
fetch all of the meeting transcription data just like i have it here right and then we will skip
it if it doesn't have any data meaning you might have a meeting where you didn't have any previous
interaction with the customer it's just gonna skip it it's not going to make a call to open AI
AI agent which is our next node but if you did have previous interaction with the same customer
it's gonna pull all of the transcripts from the Fireflies and then give it to AI agent now if
i open up AI agent you can see that it already have put together a message after reading all
of the conversation so let's check out the prompt here you can see that based on strictly provided
transcript write a sequence of 12 persuasive messages to be sent via email now you can change
the prompt as per your requirement but here i have the transcript data given to my AI agent
and now it will all read all of the text transcript data from that particular participant
what i had the meeting with and create follow-up messages and save to my google drive
now if i open up the file which it has created
that's the latest file saved with the email of the guest and it's saying follow up on our call
regarding the finish line campaign i wanted to check any video upload issue in the facebook ad
so in that particular call we were having an issue uploading the video to facebook ad manager so that's
the 12 different follow-up messages which it will pinpoint and create for us to send
follow-up messages to that specific person for completing the sale right now let's start
implementing that you will find the workflow in the description completely free no need to sign up
for any school community or anything like that just click on the link in the description copy
the workflow and that's it now once you add the workflow once you import the workflow i hope you
know that so all you have to do is just click on plus sign click on this workflow
and then simply click on these three small dots and then click on import from file so just
click on this import from file and you will have a workflow like this right and once you add the
workflow you will need to connect google calendar now i've already created a video on how you can
create google credentials but let me give you a short demo on how you can do that so you will
click on create new credentials and here you will need to generate client id and client secret
for that go to console.cloud.google.com
and make sure enable the api for google calendar so here click on these three bars
go to apis and services click on enable api and services
here we will click on enable api and services and search for google calendar now here i'm
gonna simply search calendar and click on this google calendar api now i have already it enabled
you might see it option to enable make sure to enable that once you enable that click on these
three bars again and then click on credentials i'm also going to add link in the description
where i have given a detailed video on how you can create google credentials
but this one is a short demo so let's click on create credential and click on auth client id
once you do that select web application add in your web client name
and here authorize redirect uri click on add uri and copy this url here once you click on click
to copy here paste the url here and then click on create it will give you this client id and
client secret which you will simply click on copy and paste the client secret
now once you do that click on save and your credentials will be connected you will have
a pop-up showing up like this which means that it is connected right okay now what happens on
this node is that once you create the credentials it will trigger every minute i mean it will keep
listening every minute at the moment you create a new google calendar event it's gonna trigger
and have all of the details now the workflow will start whenever you create a new meeting in google
calendar so that's it for this node and this is for just saving the variables so it's basically
saving the start time of appointment end time of appointment created by and the guest email
time of appointment created by and the guest email which we will send to fireflies api in
order to pull all of the old transcript data right and this is our graph ql node where everything
is set up you don't need to do anything except adding the api key for the graph ql right and
how you can do that you can simply click on this header auth credentials and click on create new
credentials now here you will add authorization now let me pull up the fireflies documentation
as well so i can give you some idea on what you need to do so if i pull up the fireflies
documentation you can see that this is authorization here and the bearer so i'm simply
gonna copy this part here save it in a new tab and here i will add my fireflies api so from
settings developer settings you need to click on this api key right settings developer settings
and then this copy icon to copy the fireflies api key once you click on copy make sure to
have your api key pasted here so make sure you have it in the exact same format
this is what we will add in our na 10 right so i'm simply gonna copy this part here i'm gonna ask
my video editor to zoom into this part and now let's go back to na 10 and here we will add it
in the value now for the name we will simply need to add in this authorization
and once you copy that and paste it here click on save that's it you will get this pop-up again
for the credential successfully created right now once you do that you will simply click on
execute step and you will have all of the transcript data showing up now we will simply
pass it on to our ai agent before we do that make sure we filter it based on if it has any data or
not so we are checking on this node here that it's not empty meaning if you are having a meeting
with a new person you don't have any previous fireflies data it is going to filter it out and
not going to pass this to ai agent right so this is for that note now it will pass on this data to
our ai agent i already shown you the prompt you don't have to change anything here except these
prompt instructions if you have specific instructions for the follow-up messages meaning
you want to add persona or you want to add tone of how you actually communicate with a client
you can add in more details to this prompt now once done it will save the google drive
you just need to select in the parent drive and then select the folder where you want to save the
file now the file name is this email which we are pulling up from this edit field nodes here
you can change the file name based on your requirement file content is this output which
we are pulling up from this ai agent so that's it for this video guys i hope it was helpful
