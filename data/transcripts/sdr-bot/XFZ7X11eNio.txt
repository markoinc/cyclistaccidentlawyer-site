In this video, I'll show you how you can
never miss another lead again using AI
voice agents. I'll show you my exact
systems that I use, including my AI
voice agent on Retail AI, appointment
booking workflow on NAN over here, and
the go highle workflow, and how you can
set it all up. By the end of this video,
you'll be ready to never miss another
follow-up again and fill your calendar
with appointments with pre-qualified
leads, making the most of your lead
genen efforts. I'll provide the N
template in my free school community,
the AI Avengers, down below. So, please
join. we'd love to have you in. And if
you want a custom system like this built
out for you, book a call down below. So,
let's get right into it. So, first I'll
start with going over the n workflow for
scheduling appointments directly into
your go highle calendar. So, first we're
going to start with the web hook here.
So, um we're going to go to a production
URL. So, you want to copy uh this and
paste it into your retail here. So,
functions book check availability. This
is where you copy and paste it. And then
um after that we go on to um checking
the intents. And the next one here is
the nodes. So this is to check whether
um the caller wants to book an
appointment or to check uh availability.
So I put both of the functions into uh
one workflow here just for um
convenience. I just like to put
everything into uh one workflow. So um
JSON body intent. This is where we can
determine the caller's intent. So retail
is going to push a JSON input into this
N workflow and intent will be under the
body. We just have to check if it's
equal to book appointment or check
availability. It will be one or the
other. So that's how I set it up. So um
yeah, this is just uh the check and then
we're going to determine if it's going
to be book appointment and if it is then
we're going to make an HTTP request. So
I did HTTP request because I found this
to be much more reliable than the native
GoHigh level integrations on N8N. So, um
yeah, I just I put all of these here for
you. If you join my school community and
you download the template, it's going to
be all here for you. So, the only thing
that you need to change is really um the
authorization here. So, you just have to
enter your own private integration key.
And where you can find that is um go to
your uh go high level sub account, go
under settings, go to private
integrations, and what you want to do
here is create new integration. So,
let's just do demo and uh demo
And then here you want to select the
scope. So if you want to be able to um
book appointments, you have to select
view and edit calendar, view calendar
events, uh calendar groups, resources,
and then um yeah, you can select
whichever one that you need. So like
conversation, uh messages, uh view and
edit contact. So that's what we need.
And then um yeah, you just basically uh
choose what you want uh what whatever
that you want to do on N. So um yeah,
let's just yeah, select custom fields as
well. View and edit
tags. Okay. And um yeah, view and edit
opportunities. So these are the ones
that I always select. So um yeah, just
going over this while we're at it. And
um yep. So yep, that's basically it. So
once you do that, click create. And then
you want to copy this and you want to
save it somewhere. So like on your
password manager or something like that.
So copy this and paste it somewhere.
Keep it safe because once you close
this, you won't be able to see it again.
So um anyways, just copy this and then
uh paste it into here. So now with this
key, you can make HTTP requests to go
high level cuz if you don't put uh a key
here, then you won't be able to make any
requests. So anyways, uh let's continue.
So calendar ID. So you will need to
change uh all of these as well. And the
way to find them is um by going onto um
your sub account. So um I'll actually
show you. So location, location. So this
is basically your sub account ID. So
this is your location and as you can see
here, location. So I'm under my sub
account, Nebula AI. And then um yeah,
and then for calendars, what you want to
do is you want to go to settings. um go
to calendars and then um you'll find
your calendar ID here. So yeah,
discovery call. Yeah, this is your um
calendar ID. So just copy this and then
um yeah, paste it into here and then uh
contact ID. This is the unique contact
ID provided by go high level. So when
you make an API request to retail AI to
uh trigger a call to a given number,
you're going to send the contact ID and
go retail is going to send the go
contact ID to N to make an appointment
and then um start time so booking times.
So that's going to be collected by
retail AI and sent to the NAN workflow.
And the thing is it has to be in ISO
8601 format. So I'll show you an example
of what that is. So, uh it has to be in
this exact format and you can just tell
retail to uh collect the desired
appointment time in this format. So,
this is uh 20 24 uh November 13th uh
6:30 a.m. uh Sydney time. So,
um yep. And yeah, you just have to
insert these variables. I already did
that for you. So, all you need to do is
really just uh change these. And um and
the strange thing about go high level is
that they make bookings by the uh
contact ID, not by their first name,
last name, email. So um yep, that's it
for the HTTP request. And then um if
they decide to book an appointment, but
it's unavailable, then we're going to
loop it back to check availability. And
I found GoHigh Level's um native
integration here with N to be reliable.
So, yep. Check availability, get free
slots, and again, put your calendar ID
in here and start dates. So, go highle
API docs is very weird. So, for the
start date and end date, you have to
enter both. And it has to be in the Unix
milliseconds format. So, it's like the
number of milliseconds that has passed
since January 1st, 1970. It's weird. And
I don't know why Gohigh Level did it,
but you just have to do it like this.
Yeah, I just put it here for you. Um,
yeah, new date. Okay, I'm not going to
read it, but anyways. Um, end date. So,
I what I did here is uh I checked the
availability within the next 3 days
because um you want to book an
appointment as soon as you can with a
lead. You don't want to uh book them in
for like like 3 weeks later or like a
month later. So, yeah. Anyways, you can
change this if you like. If you want to
check within the next 7 days, just
change this three to a seven. But I'll
just keep it three for now. So, if the
appointment was successful, it's going
to send a web hook response. So, um, I
did this all for you, but anyways,
response. Congratulations, your
appointment has been booked and I'm
going to check availability. And what
this is going to do, it's going to
return like a long list of um available
times by like the 30 minute or like by
the 1 hour thing depending on how long
your calendar is. So, it's going to be
like 9 9:30 10:30. And thing is, we're
not going to read out all the times to
to the caller, right? So, what we're
going to do next is an open AI node. So,
I prompted it all here for you. So, uh
it's ready to go. But anyways, what it's
going to do is you're just prompting it.
So, you're you're a transcriber. You
just found availability for booking in
the next 3 days. Now is the current
time. And here's here are the available
times. You just want to provide like two
time ranges. So, like uh Monday morning
or like Tuesday afternoon. Yeah, I did
all the prompts for you, but anyways,
I'm just going over it to make you
understand. And then you want to send a
web hook um back with the um available
times. So this will be the output of the
open AI node that I just showed you. So
that was it for this very simple and it
end workflow. So if you want to practice
and build it yourself, then you can just
play this part of the video. And here so
this is u my uh appointment setter. Uh
this is just a demo. So um yeah, you you
just want to follow the perfect prompt
formula. So, uh, role. So, you want to
describe who this person is and, uh,
describe the skills, personality, like
you're creating your own RPG character.
And then you want to go to context, uh,
current time. So, I'm just going to go
over it very briefly because I've went
over it too many times now. And then,
um, yeah, just briefly talk about your
business, what services you offer, your
contact information, and you want to put
this in as well. So, lead information.
This is a must when it comes to outbound
calls. So, the AI agent has context of
who it's calling. So yeah, first name,
last name, phone number, email address.
So this will all be provided by GoHigh
levels HTTP request. So we'll go to that
soon. And then task. So here you want to
provide step-by-step task of what the AI
agent should do. So basically the
script. So like um hey John, it's Sarah.
How how's your day going? And then like
yeah, ask if now is a good time to chat.
And if they're hesitant, just you kindly
assure them. And yeah, just get a time
to call back if they really cannot call
now. and yeah ask the qualifying
questions. So yeah, you want to you want
to customize this to your specific
business and industry. So your industry,
your revenue, uh budget and then uh if
they are qualified, then go ahead to
make the appointment. So uh yeah, these
are your steps and then the notes. So
like disqualification criteria and ways
to handle objections. I only have two
here. I could put like three more, but
if you want to put a lot more objection
handling methods, then yeah, just add it
to your knowledge base here. And then um
the flow of the conversation. So yeah,
just general rules like just like stick
to the script, be funny and witty, uh
speak at a consistent tone, and then
yeah, just ways to answer questions like
yeah, don't read like uh you're reading
from a list or like a blog post and
rules that you should never break. So
anyways, that was it for the boring
part, which was the prompt. I've been
over it too many times. So anyways, what
you want to do is you want to add a
function. So book check availability. So
that's the name of the function. So
yeah, you just want to like give it a
name booking check availability. And um
yeah, describe what it's used for. And
um like I showed you earlier, this uh
production URL, you want to put this um
in here. And then um yeah, so and then
parameter. So you want to u put in this
parameter over here. So it's basically
just uh defining the JSON schema that
it's going to be sending to the NAN
workflow. So you're basically just
sending the guideline of what N is going
to receive from retail. So yeah, you're
just describing each variable. So like
booking time, I'm describing what it is.
It's a string and it has to be an
Australia Sydney time zone in ISO format
and email last name point and then um
where was it? Intent. This is a required
variable. And yeah, I just described it
just like um all the other ones. So I'll
provide all this resources um down below
in my school community. So uh you can
check that out. But anyways um intent.
So enum. So this basically means it can
only take in these two uh values nothing
else. And then required intent and ID
which is the goal high level um unique
user ID. So anyways um that's it. And
then
um and then yeah you want to um go down
to um yeah post call analysis. So uh
these are all the uh variables and
information that you want to extract and
analyze from the call. So um yeah like
first name, last name, industry budget,
revenue. So like like the qualifying
questions and um a boolean here uh
appointment booked to determine if they
had booked an appointment or not and if
they're qualified and if they decide to
if they want you to call back at another
time. Um here as well. So So yeah, enter
the ideal call back time. So it could be
in like the ISO format if you want
retail to like call back um the leads at
a specific time or you could say like
tomorrow morning and then you can take
the call yourself. And then um yeah
agent level web hook. So this is where
the end of uh call report is going to
go. So I'll show you the go highle
workflow finally. So now the this
workflow is going to start when um an
either a uh form is submitted or a uh
Facebook lead form is submitted. So you
just want to uh you go on here and then
select the form. So whenever somebody
fills out this form, they they'll be
entered into this workflow over here. So
I've already selected my form and then
go to um yeah Facebook lead form if you
use it and then um yeah I selected my
form here as well and then yeah you want
to uh tag um the user tag the lead uh
follow-up start and then yeah you want
to add them into um your uh pipeline. So
here, so you want to add them to this uh
pipeline here just um as an example. And
then
um yeah, in pipeline lead submitted
form, opportunity name, opportunity
source. Yeah, you can uh put whatever
you like here, but I just put contact
name just uh as a demo. And then um what
what I would normally do is like uh when
they opt into my funnel, I would give
them about 30 minutes to watch the VSSL
and decide whether to book an
appointment on or not. But if they
haven't booked an appointment by 30
minutes, then either they've uh dropped
off or they've been distracted or
something like that. We don't know what
happened. But anyways, that's when we
should uh reach out to the lead. Uh we
should reach out to them as soon as they
can because uh speed to lead is key.
Like if somebody doesn't book in like 30
minutes, then we need to follow up. If
you wait for like 3 days, then they've
probably forgotten about you. So
anyways, for this normally I will put 30
minutes but I just put 1 minute just for
um a demo which I'll be showing you
later. So uh stick around and then here
we are determining if they had booked an
appointment within the next uh 1 minute
or uh 30 minutes in my actual case. So
uh wait 30 minutes determine if they
have booked an appointment or not. So
anyways to continue this will trigger
the first call. So what you want to do
here is go on to custom posts and then
copy and paste this URL. So this you can
find all of this in the retail AI API
docs. Just refer to that and then yeah
authorization. You want to select beer
token and then yeah enter your own API
key here from retail AI which you can
find by um going to your retail
dashboard. go to API keys and then yeah
just uh copy your API key here and then
uh paste it into here. So anyways um
yeah this is just template and then uh
what you want to do is you want to yeah
go down to the raw body and um yeah just
copy and paste this basically. So uh
from number so this is your AI agent
phone number from like uh Twilio or like
Tix whatever. So it has to be on E164
format. So example it has to be like
plus one two three four five. So it has
to have the country code. So plus one
for US, Canada, plus 61 for Australia,
plus 44 for UK, etc. So this will
autofill automatically. But yeah, make
sure that it's an E164 format because if
it's not, it won't work. And then yeah,
we're going to um wait 5 minutes until
like uh we decide whether to follow up
or not. So um yeah, normally I'll put
this as 1 hour, but for the purpose of
this video, I just put 5 minutes. and
and then after 5 minutes we determined
if uh the call was answered or not. So
basically copied and pasted uh this um
into here and then um if they did answer
the call then yeah we get them off the
workflow meaning that we never call them
again and then um yeah you just want to
repeat this as many times as you like
for follow-up. So yeah, for example here
um wait one day. If they don't answer
you just wait one day and then determine
if they um if they answered the call. If
not, um, call again. Wait 3 days, uh,
call again, wait 7 days, call again,
wait 10 days, and call again. And if
they still haven't called, um, after the
last, uh, six, I don't know why it's
nine, but anyways. Um, yeah, if you
still want to keep following up, then
yeah, you can, uh, repeat this workflow.
You can do a repeat workflow and then go
back all the way um, here. So basically,
it's going to repeat this entire
process. Like it's just going to like
call the lead endlessly until the person
finally books an appointment or just
tells you to go away. So anyways, uh if
you don't want to like follow up that
much, if you don't want to be that much
of a nuisance, then um yeah, just remove
this. But anyways, it's it looks very
daunting, but it's actually very simple.
It's just basically like a repeated
workflow. So um go high level. It might
look complicated, but it's actually very
simple when you um try it out. So
anyways, this is um the overview of the
workflow. So now I'll demonstrate it in
action. So I'll go on to my funnel here.
So I'll just like fill out my details
here. So now I just submitted the form.
Now I am on my VSSL page. So I should um
ideally have 30 minutes to uh watch this
VSSL and uh to book a call. And if they
don't, well the AI voice agent is going
to reach out to me. And now as you can
see here on the execution log. So um I
have uh been uh entered into this
workflow. So as you can see I just got a
call. So I'll just answer it.
Hey John, it's Sarah from Nebula AI.
How's your day going? Awesome.
Wait. Uh it's good. Thanks. Uh how are
you?
Awesome. I see that you recently
expressed interested in AI solutions on
our website but haven't yet booked an
appointment. Do you have a few minutes
to chat about that? Uh yeah, sure.
Great. Before we move forward, let's
quickly go through a few questions to
see if we'd be a good fit for you. What
industry are you in? Uh so I um own a
solar company.
Gotcha. And if you don't mind me asking,
what's your current monthly revenue? Uh
my monthly revenue is 100K a month.
Amazing. What is your current budget for
AI solutions? Um, looking at um maximum
uh $15,000.
It sounds like we could really help you
out. Would you be open to booking a
quick strategy call with one of our
specialists? Um, yeah, sure. What times
do you have available?
By the way, are you the main decision
maker for this? Um, yeah, absolutely. Do
you have a specific date and time in
mind? Um, let's see. Could you do maybe
like um maybe on like Tuesday?
I'll check that for you just a second.
Do you have a time in mind for Tuesday?
Could you please um book me in uh for
Tuesday at 11 a.m.?
I'll check that for you. Just a second.
Okay, awesome. Just to confirm, this
number I am calling to right now is the
correct number. Uh yeah, that's right.
Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, is
your email is
jngmail.com? Uh yeah, that's right.
Perfect. I have booked you in for
Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. Do you have any
further questions? Um, no. That was it.
Thank you.
Perfect. Thank you so much for your
time, John. Have a pleasant day and
we'll speak soon. All right. Thank you.
So, now imagine this AI agent reaching
out to your leads uh the moment that
they express interest and to qualify and
nurture them and to uh get them booked
on a appointment with you. So, think of
all the times that you missed follow-ups
or you uh saw that leads have dropped
off, but you've never had the chance to
follow up with them or even speak to
them. That's going to be a thing of the
past with these AI agents. So, with this
AI agent, you will never have to worry
about leads ever again, and you can uh
book them straight into your calendar.
So, you'll not only wake up to a
calendar full of booked leads, but also
leads that are really qualified and
ready to go. So you don't ever have to
worry about dealing with time wasters
again or worry about missed follow-up or
a missed lead. So that was it for this
video. I hope you found it valuable. If
you have any questions, leave a comment
down below. I have this NAN template in
my free school community down below and
the go highle workflow in my SAS Jarvis.
