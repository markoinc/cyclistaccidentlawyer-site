I will break down how you can create an
AI telegram chat bot in 2024 and we are
going to create a telegram bot that
automatically replies to questions of an
e-commerce business and is trained on a
custom knowledge based document and I
will guide you step by step so I will
show you what chat automation tool you
should use how you can create your own
telegram chat pod and how you can add AI
that is trained on your own data such as
your websites or internal documents
about your business and at the end I
will even give you the template for free
so you don't have to build it yourself
and you can just copy and paste it and
if you're new to the channel my name is
Jordan and I'm the founder of chamise
and at chamise we are inspiring over
50,000 people to generate more leads
boost revenue and reduce cost and we are
working with businesses from small to
large and in any industry so if you just
follow the steps in this tutorial it
will work for your business as well and
in this video I'm using the example of
an e-commerce business but this will
actually work for any type of business
business but you can just change the
content of the knowledge based document
and then train your AI chatbot on it and
then your AI chatbot can answer any
questions about your business as well so
let's get started so the first thing
that we need to do is create our manat
account and manich chat is the chat
automation platform that I've been using
for over the last four years for almost
all of my clients and I use manat
because it's very easy to use you can
use them without any chat automation
experience they're very cheap so they
offer already a free plan but their pay
plan already starts at $15 a month and
it's a no code platform so that means
that we can create our telegram chat bot
without writing any code so if you just
go to chat.com
slmc then this will bring you directly
to the minap website and then here you
can just click on get started and then
click on Telegram and then what you need
to do is you need to click on continue
with telegram and then man chat will
open up Telegram and we'll verify your
telegram account and then you need to
verify your email address and once you
have done that your manat account is
created but I already have a manat
account so I will just sign in so now
I'm signed in to my manat account and
then when I click on settings and then
click on telegram then here I can click
on connect and then I need to connect
with a telegram bot and in order to do
that we first need to have a talk with
the B father on telegram so I will just
go to telegram on my desktop but this
will also work on your phone and then
you need to search for the Bol fer start
it and then here we can start a
conversation then it says okay you can
control me so then we need to say Slash
new bot or you can just click here on
new bot so I just type that in and says
all right a new bot how are we going to
call it so I just call this Chad amise
telegram AI bot it's pretty long but it
works then we need to choose a username
for the bot and with the username it's
important that it always ends with bot
so I'll just fill in the same thing and
then says done and then we get a token
for the HTTP API and we actually need to
click on this token because then it will
copy to our clipboard and if we go back
to manat then we can just click on
connect existing bot paste that bot
token and then click on connect and now
our telegram chatbot is connected to
many Chad and we can get started with
creating our first telegram automation
so the first thing that we are going to
do is automatically reply to a message
so with e-commerce businesses a lot of
people are asking about the return
policy so basically every time someone
asks a question about to return policy
we want to automatically reply to that
question with the return policy of our
e-commerce business so in many chat you
can just go to Automation and then click
on new automation click on start from
scratch and we will first rename this so
I will rename this to return policy and
then Telegram and then each Automation
in manat consists of a trigger and the
content of the flow so the trigger is
the event that starts the Automation and
the content of the automation is what
will happen once it is triggered so in
order to automatically reply to a
message we can just click on new trigger
here click on Telegram and then click on
user sends a message then we will choose
for detect specific words in a message
and then we say if the message contains
return and then we can add a message
condition so we can click on this and
then we can say okay if the message
contains return and the message contains
policy then we want to start this
automation so here we can just click on
Create and then we need to determine the
content of the automation so here we can
just click on Telegram and then we can
say at e-commerce Bas you always have
the option of returning your order
within 14 days after delivery make sure
that the products have not been worn and
have all F Texs attached when they are
returned so it's pretty simple and once
you've answered a question with your
chatbot you always want to ensure a good
customer experience and in order to do
that you can ask just a very simple
question you can just ask Does this
answer your question and if they say yes
and we say okay awesome that was it and
if they say no then we can say okay we
can connect you with one of our support
agents that can actually help them with
solving their problem so what we can do
here is we can add a Next Step choose
again for telegram and then we can say
does that answer your question and then
we can add two buttons one button with
yes it does and one button with nope so
when they click on yes it does then we
are just going to send a very simple
message with great if you have any more
questions feel free to ask them here if
they say no I need help what we then can
do is we can say no problem we will now
connect you with one of our support
agents and then in order to actually
connect them with one of these support
agents we need to add actions to our
flow and this is great about man chat so
man chat has a built-in live chat and
that means that every time your chatbot
doesn't know the answer to a question or
one of your customers basically need
help we can connect them with a live
chat agent and then your live chat agent
can actually solve the problem of the
customer so in order to do that we can
add a Next Step click on actions then
click on plus action choose for live
chat and then click on Mark the
conversation as open so in many chat we
have two types of conversations we have
closed conversations and open
conversations closed conversations are
conversations that are handled by your
chatbot open conversations are
conversations that are handled by your
support team and your life chat agents
so in this case we need to Mark the
conversation as open so once we have
opened the conversation then we need to
add another action choose for live chat
again and then say assign the
conversation so here we can assign the
conversation to specific team member or
to a specific group of team members so
in this case I would just go with myself
so I will go with joran and then lastly
we need to notify the people that are
assigned so here we can just click on
ADD action click on live chat and then
click on notify SNES and then here you
can also determine who needs to be
notified so you can notify the whole
team or I can just Notify myself only
and we can also change the notification
text so instead of saying full name just
did something you wanted to know about
we can also say full name has a question
probably about returns so we can now hit
set live and then our automation is
working so basically now every time
someone sends a message about the return
policy then we say the answer to the
question so what the return policy is
and then we ask does it answer your
question if they say yes it does then we
say great if you have any more questions
feel free to ask them here if they say
no I need help then we say no problem we
will now connect you with one of our
support agents and then we get actually
notified of that conversation in our
email with a button to the live chat CH
of many chat so up until now it has been
pretty simple someone ask us a question
in our telegram bot we check if we can
find certain words in it and if we can
find the words then we can automatically
reply to that question but we can
actually take it one step further and we
can add custom AI that is trained on
your own data such as your website or
internal documents about your business
and manat doesn't have build-in ai so
that's why we're going to use chatbase
so chatbase is an AI tool that you can
use to create a chatbot and train it on
your own data such as your websites or
documents about your business so if you
haven't used chat mates before you can
just go to chadis.com
CB and this will bring you directly to
the chatbase website so here you can
just click on build your chatbot and
then you can create your own account and
then add your chatot there I already
created a chatot so if I go to chatbots
here then here I have a chatot and this
chatbot is trained on a custom knowledge
based document so here I have a simple
document that contains information about
an e-commerce business so it contains
information about returns about the
return term about the return policy
about the delivery about the shipping
cost about tracking your order about
warranty like all that kind of stuff so
what I've done in chatbase is that I
created a new chatbot and if you go to
sources then you can determine where you
want to train your chatbot on and I
already trained it on this custom
knowledge based document and then if you
go to here you can already talk to your
chatbot directly so here I can say
something like okay what are your
warranty conditions then says if your
product is broken within 8 weeks you
will get a full refund or how long does
it take to ship my order then says if
you create an order before three it will
be shipped from my warehouse within two
business day and this is great and what
I really like about chat Bas that's
really easy to use but also if you go to
the dashboard and then go to the logs
then here you can see the conversation
and if you don't like the answer that
chatbase gave you can just click here on
revise answer and then you can fill in
the response you actually expected and
when you're doing this chat base can
automatically learn from the answers
that you're giving and automatically
improves itself so that's what I like
about chat base very easy to use and can
very easily improve the answers of your
chatbot so basically what we need to do
now is that every time someone is asking
a question in man chat and in telegram
we need to send that question to
chatbase and then chat base can answer
the question for us and we need to send
the answer from chatbase back to man
chat and in order to do that we are
going to use make so make is an
integration platform that you can use to
connect to apps to each other without
using any code and in this case we are
going to use it to connect many chat to
chat base and if this sounds pretty
technical I actually have a step-by-step
video where I explain every step of this
integration and how you can create this
yourself in this video I will just use
the integration that I already created
and I will explain it a bit but if you
want to Deep dive in it and want to
understand every step of this
integration I highly recommend going to
the video that probably appears over
here so if you haven't used make before
you can just go to chadis.com slake and
if you use my link which is also in the
description you get one month of the Pro
Plan for free and then afterwards you
can also decide to just go to the free
plan of make because make already has a
pretty good free plan but you can use
the Pro Plan for free for one month if
you're using my link so in order to
create this integration we are going to
start in many chat so if we go back to
manat then here we have the settings
then we have Telegram and then here we
have the default reply and the default
reply is the Automation in manat that
triggers if no other automation is
triggered so every time someone is
sending a message to your telegram bot
and no other automation is triggered for
example by using one of the keywords
like we did before with the return
policy then the default reply is
triggered so basically every time they
ask a question we want to trigger the
default reply and we're going to use the
default reply to send that question to
Jet base so what you need to do here is
you need to click on select existing and
then click on the telegram default reply
and this automation is also part of the
free template that you can download with
the link in the description so you can
just download that template in your
manat account and then you can use that
automation so here you can just click on
pick this Automation and then click on
it and then there are three important
parts with this automation so the first
thing is the trigger so we need to
trigger this every time someone sends a
message so we need to set this to every
time that's very important then then we
are going to save the last input so the
last text input which is basically the
question from someone we are going to
save that to the user field chatbase
question and this is just a field in man
chat where we can store data and then
lastly we are going to trigger make to
send the question to chat base and then
if we go to make then this is what that
integration looks like so what we're
doing is we're waiting on data from
manat so every time this is triggered
then this will start then we are going
to send the question to chatbase then
chatbase will answer the question for us
and then we are going to add the answer
to a custom field in many chat so that
will be the custom field chatbase answer
and then lastly we are going to send a
man chat Automation and to show you what
that automation looks like then I go to
the chatbase answer Telegram and this is
also part of my free template and then
what we do here is we just give the
answer from chat base and then we ask
Does this answer your question and then
if they say yes then say okay awesome
that's fine if to say no I need help no
problem one of our agents will contact
you as soon as possible and it's
basically the same flow as what we did
with the return policy but now we're
using custom Ai and we can automatically
answer questions about the business and
that's it so those are all the
automations that you need to add AI to
your telegram chatbot and before we're
going to test our chatbot there's just
one thing we need to do left we need to
add a welcome message to our telegram
bot and the welcome message is the first
message that someone gets when they
start a conversation with our bot and in
order to set this up we can just go to
settings go to Telegram and here you can
find the welcome message so then we can
just click on create a new reply and
then we can say we can click here and
then we can say I just copy this hey I'm
the digital assistant of e-commerce base
I will try to answer your question if I
don't know the answer I can always
connect you with a support agent what is
your question about please type in your
question below and that's basically all
you need to do because now if somebody
replies to this question then our return
policy automation will trigger or the
default reply will trigger so we can
just click on update here and now it is
live and then we need to make sure that
the trigger is also enabled so I click
on this then I enable this and then it
should be working so now if we head over
to telegram then we can test out our
telegram bot so now I am in Telegram and
I can just click on start and it says
hey I'm the digital assistant of
e-commerce base I will try to answer
your question if I don't know the answer
I can always connect you what is your
question about so then I ask what is
your return policy because this will
trigger the return policy automation
then it says at e-commerce B you always
have the option of returning your order
within 14 days does that answer your
question and I can say yes it does and
said great if you have any more
questions feel free to ask them here and
I can say okay how long does it take to
ship my order then it says if you create
an order before 3 it will be shipped
from our warehouse within two business
days and this is actually generated by
chatbase so we can also do something
else how can I get warranty on my
products and says to get warranty on
your products please send an email to
info at e-commerce Bas which your order
number and a picture of the broken item
Does this answer your question then I
say no I need help and it says no
problem one of your agents will contact
you as soon as possible to help you and
then if we go back to many chat and then
go to the live chat then if you go to
the conversations that are assigned to
you then will see here that this
conversation has been assigned to me and
it says okay no I need help and here you
can see the complete conversation
someone has with your telegram boot so
here when you start typing so when you
send them a message and I say hey Jordan
here then the automation will be passed
automatically and then you can just have
a back and forward conversation with
your customer and once you have solve
the problem then you can just click on
this cross here which will enable the
chatbot again and then click on Mark as
closed and then everything is fixed but
that's it that's how you can create your
own AI telegram chatbot in 2024 and if
you want to get started quickly you can
just download the template with the link
