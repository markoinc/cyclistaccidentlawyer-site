using an Instagram chat bot in your DMs
can triple the sales you make from your
content in less than 24 hours in this
video I'm going to show you how to stop
relying on your lincol bio to make you
sales and instead use this strategy to
bring in new customers every single time
you post by using a tool called men chat
now 99% of businesses even those using
tools like manychat still don't use
these simple hacks so in this video I'll
walk you through them real quick if
you're new here my name is Natasha
Willis I run a marketing agency school
abots and these are some of the best
strategies that I have learned over the
last 7 years that have helped me make
more than $70 million in sales for
clients directly in the DMS so let me
give you some examples of Instagram
accounts generating a ton of Revenue
using these strategies now you don't
need millions or even 100K plus
followers to make sales every single
time you post with this strategy so this
account a client of mine had 7,000
followers and made $5,000 in the first 7
Days of using this let's go up a little
bit and account this account also a
client made $155,000 in their first 3
days of using this and they've now made
over $100,000 in sales this account made
$150,000 in sales in the first two
months of doing this this account has
made $2.8 million in sales in the first
year of doing this this account has made
$1.7 million in sales in the first 12
months and this account has made
$500,000 in sales in the first 12 months
now this account didn't just make a
bunch of money from doing this but they
also Grew From 650,000 followers to 2.1
million followers as well now most
people are missing out on 50% or more of
the traffic that they could be getting
from Instagram into the DFS because
here's the thing is if you actually want
to make more sales for your products and
your services from your content
predictably then finding underpriced
attention and using it to have an unfair
advantage on social media is the name of
the game for example Gary ve who I would
consider the king of leveraging
underpriced attention used Google
AdWords to grow his dad's wine business
from $3 million in annual sales to 60
million and DMS are your opportunity
right now to capitalize on underpriced
attention so many businesses are
underutilizing the DMS right now but you
should know that the head of Instagram
has said that the DMS are where people
are most active and last year meta told
me that over 600 million conversations
are happening every single day between
businesses and people on their three
apps Instagram DM Facebook messenger and
WhatsApp long story short this is a huge
Trend in consumer behavior that you want
to be taking advantage of because
Instagram DMS are just the beginning now
let's actually talk about how to set
this up now for your account now that
you understand the potential and the
power of this and in order to really
harness that I mentioned that most
people are missing out on the traffic
that they could be getting into their
DMS the first of the nine ways is
commenting on a post for a real now when
you ask somebody to comment on your post
you want to tell them to comment a
specific word you want to give people as
many clear instructions as possible and
make it really simple for them to quote
unquote opt in now the word you pick
should be seven characters or less
that's we have found to be The Sweet
Spot in testing over 20,000 words now on
accounts that are between 7K followers
to 45 million followers now the next way
is having people reply to a story so in
your story instead of saying hey click
this link to go check out my freebie or
my product or my service instead you can
tell people to Simply reply to the story
with the word that you pick the same
rules apply to the word you pick here
for your stories as they do for the
posts that I just mentioned now way
three will be to use your bio so the
profile bio to let people know what they
can message you the reason why this one
is really powerful is that often times
if somebody is either trying to find a
new product or service that they need to
solve their problem and they happen to
see your ad or your piece of content and
they come to your profile then you want
to be able to redirect them to something
that will be relevant and helpful for
them right away instead of forcing them
to have to figure out what they want to
do on your profile do they want to go to
your link in BIO and there's so many
links and now I don't know which one to
pick from or do I pick a post to watch
oh this one looks interesting but how do
I kind of go about doing that I'm now
having to be forced to make a decision
so if you have a very clear call to
action on your profile that says for
example on ours message us the word and
then insert the word to get XYZ it could
be a resource to get started with what
it is that I do or um message us this
word to get a discount code if you're an
e-commerce store so whatever that first
step is that most customers tend to take
with you before they buy that's the
action that you want to tell people to
do in your bio ideally in the second or
the third line and you're using the same
word that you're using in your stories
and your posts as well now way four is
story tags in other words story mentions
if somebody tags you in their story
let's say that you have a podcast or a
YouTube video like this and people are
posting on their stories saying wow this
YouTube video like really hit home for
me they might tag you in that story as
soon as they do that you can also
trigger an automated message to be sent
to those people way five will be a
direct message and this is when you have
people message you that specific word
that they are going to be sending you
that they see on your profile or your
stories or your posts but what can also
happen here is you can actually pre-
prompt people meaning telling them
inside of the DMS as soon as they get
there for the first time here's what you
should do with me here are the options
that I can uh present you with so you'll
see how in this example we can add
little bubbles that have some common
questions or some common paths that we
would suggest people take now the sixth
way is using links and I'll show you a
link here on this screen of how you can
send people directly to your DMs and the
power of this is not only can they go
directly to your DMs but if you use a
strategy that I'm walking you through
you can also send them a specific
message as soon as they click into that
link and that link is clickable from an
email from your website and fun fact you
could also turn this link into a QR code
and then put that QR code on a digital
presentation on an e-commerce box and
from there you can now have people scan
the QR code go directly into your DMs
and then receive an automated message
and if that wasn't enough here are a
couple last ones the next one is ADS so
you can have somebody either comment on
an ad or click on an ad and receive an
automated message from you you can also
have people comment on an Instagram live
this one is hugely underrated and funny
story I had a client who was so
resistant to going live they were like
there's no reason it's such a waste of
time nothing ever comes out of this and
I said look just give it a shot and in
the live tell people to comment a
specific word to get a freeb that you
offer she went ahead and did that and as
soon as she did that within an hour she
messaged me and said holy crap I just
got over 300 emails from my one live and
now I'm going to post it as a post on my
feed because you get a two for one with
a live right you have people who show up
to the live you also have people who can
watch the recording on your feed
thereafter and now that's also an opt-in
point and by by the way you're using the
same word that you chose to use in your
post and your stories and your bio it's
all the same so same rules apply for
your live comments as well so lives are
real powerful don't sleep on them
they're highly underrated right now and
finally your broadcast channels so if
you're not already using a broadcast
channel or maybe you don't even know
what this is this is kind of like a
group chat on Instagram that's
associated with your profile so rather
than dming somebody from your profile
you are sending out to a channel that
someone can subscribe to and everyone in
the channel can see reactions to your
messages but they cannot reply in that
channel so it's an easy thing to manage
because you can just send voice notes or
posts or selfie videos or that kind of
thing inside of the channel but then
from there it's not a back and forth
necessarily engagement so what we do in
broadcast channels is because we can
send outbound messages to people there
anytime and they'll get a notification
in their DMS which is one of the Prime
real estate pieces on Instagram right
now like I mentioned right the head of
Instagram moseri has said that DMS are
where people are spending a lot of time
most of their time on the platform then
you can be using broadcast channels to
tell people hey in combination with the
link that I just told you to use right
tell people to click on that link they
now go directly to a DM with you and
then they can send you the word that you
have told them to send you in other
places to so those are going to be the
nine ways that we can actually send
traffic into your DMs and start
conversations with people automatically
that drive more sales for you instantly
now that you know the nine ways that
people can actually go into your DMs
automatically let's set up your account
on that platform that I mentioned called
Menat now many chat is my favorite tool
to connect your Instagram account to so
that you can run all of these
automations out of it it's kind of like
an email marketing platform for your DMs
so I'm going to drop a link in the video
description where you will get my
internal process for how I have set up
thousands of many chat accounts that do
lots of volume hundreds of thousands
millions of messages and you don't have
to give me anything there's no opt-in
it's just simply a walkthr of how to set
up your account now I would pay close
attention to steps one and steps 10
because they are about your settings and
this is the most common mistake that
people make that can have a ton of
issues later on but if you set it up
correctly from the beginning then you
won't have any of these problems and you
can use my promo code Natasha to get 30
days for free so you can test this out
risk-free without paying a dime on your
Instagram account and see how quickly
you get results now once you set up your
account on many chat you'll be able to
set up each of those triggers that I
just mentioned so let me go ahead and
show you how to do that in inside of
many chat let's hop into my computer
once you've connected your Instagram
account to many chat using my process
your settings are correct on your
Instagram account as well as your
Facebook page settings which was that
step 10 that I mentioned then now let's
go into many chat and go to a specific
tab so we can set up each of these
triggers now the first thing you want to
do is once you're inside you want to on
the left column click the automation tab
once you're here you will see a page
that kind of looks like what I'm showing
you here but I want to warn I have a lot
of templates and different folders in
here so don't concerned if you don't see
any of this in your own account um
that'll come later as you get more
advanced with this but up here in the
top right corner go ahead and click plus
new automation once you've done that
it's going to take you to this page here
and what we're going to do is hit start
from scratch now from here go ahead and
hit on this when button right here this
when box and this is where we'll start
to set up the triggers so I'm going to
show you each of those nine triggers and
how to do that all inside of this one
automation so as we go through this over
the next couple of minutes it's going to
get a little bit Hefty but I don't want
you to worry at all I'm going to hold
your hand the entire way so that you
know exactly how to set this up but also
make sure that it works once it is
actually set up and that it doesn't
break so the first thing we'll do is hit
plus new trigger and once we're here as
you're seeing you can also do this for
Facebook I'm not going to go into that
in this video but I will do another
video later on on how to do this on
Facebook as well because Facebook is
highly underrated right now talk about
underpriced attention just for a sec
mini rant um Gary ve who I mentioned is
the king of underpriced attention and
leveraging it has said that Facebook was
his fastest growing Channel over the
last 2 years now it's funny because
Facebook has been around as one of the
OG social medias right they literally
showed us how to social media and then
so many other platforms have come from
that but Facebook is making a huge
comeback right now and the fact that
meta has been continued to be like such
a big force in the world and now they're
leading Ai and the metaverse and all
these different things they're not going
anywhere anytime soon and Facebook is
still their biggest piece of the
business when it comes to the growth
that they see month over month with
users and also just the amount of
content and engagement that happens
there every single day so not to be
underestimated if you're not leveraging
Facebook even if you don't personally
use it or consume content on there it is
a huge opportunity back to the video so
for Instagram we'll go ahead and click
into the Instagram tab now under the
triggers here what we will do is first
let's click on user comments on your
post or your real since this is probably
going to be the most common one that you
use and fun fact 50% of our traffic that
we get from Instagram comes from this
one and it's also the most highly
visible one right so as people are
seeing this trend of telling people to
comment on your post to get access to
something has become bigger and bigger
and more mainstream people think oh I
can just do this on my post that's great
but they completely forget about those
eight other ones so this one for sure
you want to set up but then the other
ones too are going to be just as
powerful so once we're here what you'll
want to select is all poster reels the
reason why we choose all poster reels is
because you want to make sure that you
don't have to come in here as soon as
you post a post and set this all up you
can set this up and set it and forget it
and then in your post anytime you want
to tell people to comment a word for
example like strategy if you go to our
Instagram you can see how on each of our
posts we are obviously following a very
specific formula that we have found now
works incredibly well so you'll see how
there are different words on different
posts but what you'll see at its core is
that we always tell people to comment a
specific word and we do it repeatedly
over time too so there's not just one
post that has one word we have multiple
posts with the same word so that's why
this is really helpful so we'll go ahead
and hit all poster reals go ahead and
hit continue and now here in the
settings you can say hey I want when
people comment the word let's say
strategy I want to trigger this for them
now a few important things if you think
that there will be common misspellings
of the word that you are picking then
you want to make sure you include those
misspellings here and if you're not sure
you can't think literally of any
misspellings people might have then
that's okay and what you can do later on
is once you have data meaning once at
least a couple people comment on your
post and if you spot any misspellings
you can then add those misspellings here
later on this next section allows you to
exclude any words that you don't want to
trigger automated messages for in the
same comment let's say that instead of
someone just writing the word strategy
like they were instructed to they might
on a different post of yours say hey
this is an awesome strategy thank you so
much for sharing this now if they said
that then you might not want to trigger
your automation based off of that we
find often times it's really not a big
deal and people don't mind but if you
feel really adamant about hey I don't
want to trigger when people say these
specific words then you could right here
just say hey I don't want this to
trigger if someone says I'm excited
about this great and you can add as many
of them as you want to and then we'll go
ahead and hit continue the next section
here is for a reply now this is
technically automated comments and our
next step we'll set up what Min chat is
saying is a public reply here and it's
really just a comment response after
somebody comments the word strategy we
can then send an automated response to
their comment to say hey thanks so much
for commenting I'm so excited for you to
get access to this product this service
this freebie whatever it was that you
were promising people and then from
there you can remind them to check their
DMS for the thing that you just sent
over to so you can go ahead and say
something like the examples that are
showing right here you can also go to
our Instagram and see all the varieties
we typically will set up at least six
variations right here just to make sure
that there's enough variety that it's
not the same comment over and over and
over again done so here are three
examples of what you can say to people
in these automated comments now we'll go
ahead and hit save right here at the
bottom and once that's done then I can
click over here in this gray area and
now our first automation is all set up
now in order for you to see this through
to the end before before we set up the
rest of the triggers I'm going to show
you how to set up the message that
people would actually receive from you
so if I click into this Instagram box
here first thing you'll notice is that
this says send as a comment reply and so
that means that people who are
commenting on your post will
successfully receive this message this
is super important we'll go ahead and
just add in a little bit of text right
here so let me go ahead and type that
out for you and then we'll move on to
the next thing all right just saves you
a little bit of time I have written out
a message here that you can follow the
similar structure for and what you'll
notice if I break this down super quick
for you is that as you're writing this
out you want to think about if you were
messaging a friend what would this say
so you want to have a greeting right hi
hey there what's up fam like whatever
however you talk is going to be what you
want to have there now the second
sentence should talk about directly what
it was that you promised in your post to
remind them most people 85% or more are
going to see this message pretty
instantly and they're going to hop into
it and take action on this now the other
15% and if your post for to go super
viral and you have people who are brand
new to you maybe you're sitting in their
message request for just a little bit or
they're just taking a while to get back
to your message let's say that you
target parents and they're busy and you
know have a lot going on maybe they
don't see your DM for a few days and so
if at that point they can't remember
what it was that you were telling them
in the DMS and what you were promising
them then they're not going to reply to
this cuz now this feels like maybe a
outbound kind of cold DM or something
where they're like what is this again
did I opt into this so you want to
remind them of what it was they opted in
for and also as we're breaking down this
copy here what the outcome is that
they're really looking for so here we're
saying can't wait for you to learn more
about how to start homesteading so how
to start homesteading is the thing that
they want to learn so that you can
achieve true freedom for your family and
depending on your business type you
might have either an emotional benefit
here which this would be an emotional
benefit achieve true freedom for your
family or a logical benefit let's say
that you sell to business owners you
might say how to solve that you know
pesky software problem you've been
having or how to uh automate more of
your business whatever it might be so
that's how we typically structure this I
chose homesteading because that Niche is
just popping off right now and I figured
why not choose an example that is so
different from you know online marketing
and and some of these more common things
you might see like making money online
so from there then we say just click the
button below to get access to my
ultimate free guide I'm doing very
specific things here we have sent close
to 100 million messages on Instagram DM
and the messaging platforms so I'm going
to break down what's happening here
first we are telling people very clearly
at the beginning of the sentence that
they need to click the button below just
click the button below saying just
because it's just that simple just click
the button below just has increased our
click rate from anywhere between 5 to
30% sometimes depending on the call to
action again very specific after we do
that I'm saying below where is the
button it's below to get access to get
access is the desired action that this
person is going to take so they are
going to get access in exchange for
clicking the button to my ultimate free
guide now ultimate free guide could be
replaced for whatever offer you're going
to choose and then I want to pick an
emoji that is bright and that lets them
know that they want to click below so in
this case I chose just a default skin
color Emoji that's point down and then
in the button I'm going to use the same
language so I'm not going to say
download your guide or something I'm
going to say get your guide here and
from there I add a little Emoji so that
people's eyes are reading it from left
to right in the button and then finally
they click in now the way that this is
set up is that because I built this and
then you know showed it to you what
you'll want to do when you set this up
is hit the add button and then choose
what you want to write in here this
little Smiley will bring up all the
Emojis and then you select open website
and send people to your website maybe
it's a landing page link maybe it's just
your direct website link maybe it's a
page where they can book a call maybe
it's your e-commerce store website
whatever it is that you want to send
people to drop in that website here I'll
go ahead and remove this extra button
for now cuz this is all you will need
and then hit the update button or it
might say set live whatever text is in
this blue box that's okay just go ahead
and hit it and it will now update this
now the thing is that typically when you
do that over here in this when box this
may have turned green so go ahead and
turn that off for a second just to make
sure that everything's looking good to
you just double check and now what you
can do is go over to your Instagram
account but from a different account so
let's say you have a company account and
a personal account log into your
personal account go to the company page
if that's where you built this on and
connected the account to many chap so
whatever account that is right go to
that account and then go to any of your
posts and now if you do want to turn
this on and test it make sure it's green
here and then go ahead and comment that
word and see if you receive the message
in your DMs should happen pretty
instantaneously so now that you have set
this up firstly big pat on the back this
is an awesome first step and you could
leave it at just this if you want to do
what most people are doing right now now
on Instagram when they leverage
automation this is all they're doing and
that's it now if you want to tap into
50% or more traffic you could actually
be getting into your DMs now let's get
into actually setting up each of those
other triggers let's get into leaden
strategy number dose so what you'll do
is hop into the wi box again hit the new
trigger you already know how to do this
so go ahead and click into this box and
then hit replies to your story so click
into that and now what this will do here
is we're going to say all stories to
make it really simple once again so that
anytime you're doing story you don't
even have to think about it you don't
have to come in and set this up for
every story you know that it will be set
up and then for this option it says
Reply contains any words or reaction go
ahead and select contain specific words
or reaction and then we'll choose the
same word I'm going to use strategy here
for the sake of a example but you
already know seven characters or less
ideally don't include numbers in here
don't include any like fancy characters
simply just a word that is easy to spell
next right here where it says delay the
automation this is up to you I think
that this is in here because sometimes
it feels a little more human quote
unquote quote if like you wait 5 seconds
or 10 seconds rather than an instant
response however also because we're
setting the expectation hey I'm going to
send this to you immediately right now
we find that naturally because we're
doing instantly instant gratification
and instant results for people as soon
as they message you in your story if we
send them the message instantly as well
instead of waiting then we will get a
higher open rate and higher click rate
on that first message right makes sense
so this could make sense if you are
doing something that's not leg gen
related if you're like hey thanks for
checking out my story I appreciate you
blah blah blah like not trying to get
leads for something in sales but you're
here because you want to monetize your
content better and you want to have the
potential of tripling your sales from
your content as many of the accounts
that we work with have done so in this
case here leave it at 0 seconds just for
the sake of this example trust me on
this and see how it performs and then
from there you could also like their
response that would be an extra
notification they would get what would
happen is that as soon as they reply to
your story they would receive a
notification that said Natasha T Willis
for example using me as an example here
that liked your message and then they
get a hey can't wait for you to learn
more about how to start homesteading Etc
all right so this actually in my opinion
and with the data kind of humanizes it
more than delaying the automation
because you're not losing anything here
you're only gaining you're only adding
more interaction the more interaction
the better they're going to get now two
quick notifications in a row um but it's
not overwhelming it's like they liked
your message oh cool like that feels
human and then they went ahead and
received the next message so I typically
like to do this here and then go ahead
and hit save if this is your first time
doing it or if you are redoing an
Automation and you're watching this to
find out how you want to set this up
follow these instructions exactly and
then you can start to experiment later
on I'm also going to have quite a few
videos going into a lot deeper how each
of these different triggers works and
how we optimize for them because we get
a lot of traffic from all of the
different nine that I showed you and
there's so much more that I can't
possibly dive into this would be like a
12-h hour long video um I just can't
cram it all in here so I want to give
you the initial strategy to do this
everywhere so you can take advantage of
all the traffic and then now we can take
it to the second level the third level
the 10th level Etc later on in other
videos okay so we've got our post and
our story so far so next let's get into
how to set this up on the bio of your
profile so here for the new trigger
we're going to select user sends a
message so go ahead and click into this
and then we'll say detect specific words
in a message again I'm going to roll
with the word strategy but this is very
important two things I want to do here
the first is message is so only if they
just say strategy in their message I
want to select that option okay and then
I'm going to hit create now as a
reminder if this word could be easily
misspelled or you think that people are
misspelling it already take that data
plop it into here later on initially
don't worry about it right now um but
it's something that you can add in later
on for example right sty or something
like people misspell stuff all the time
that could definitely be one that you
drop in there quick thing I also want to
mention here is that you can duplicate
this this is a little bit more advanced
so if you're already right now in the
video like wow this is a lot I'm
learning a lot but man I want to first
test this out and then wrap my head
around it totally cool ignore this next
step super quick before we get into the
next one if you want to take this to the
slightly Next Level and just save
yourself some time from having to
manually fix anything that comes up
right here next to this one go ahead and
click on these three circles and hit
duplicate now what we'll do in this box
is go ahead and hit message begins with
this means that the people who type
something like strategy I'm so excited
da da da da um this will also trigger
for them because guaranteed you will
have people like this if people are
excited about what you're sharing which
most likely they will be and so they'll
say strategy I can't wait to see this
Etc you'll get a couple people like that
now these people who send you a message
directly are going to be the ones who
are going from your bio and then
messaging you a word directly after that
so now we've taken care of all those
peeps our next lead generation method is
a story mention or tag the first thing
we'll do is rename this entire
automation because we are about to
duplicate it for our story mentions so
up here in the top right corner click on
these three circles and then hit rename
now I'm going to name mine homesteading
free guide so name yours whatever makes
sense for you once you've done that hit
the rename button and now you're all set
now what we're going to do is over here
on the left hand side this might have
gone away for you as well so go ahead
and click in so that you can extend it
and then hit Automation and now if you
scroll down over here if you have
followed my steps exactly in this video
then this first option here should pop
up for you so I'm going to go ahead and
rename that thing right there now what
I'm going to do is duplicate this so in
the top right corner hit these three
circles and hit duplicate now once I
have duplicated it then I'm going to go
back to my automations folder which I
can do by doing this scroll down you'll
see it says homesteading free guide copy
so a few things we're going to do here
I'm going to click into this and I'm
going to rename this story mentions and
then C now over here where it says edit
automation click into that and as you
can see for some reason it's covering it
so I'm going to go ahead and click into
this box and then drag okay so click and
drag and then let go once you're here
we're going to hit the three circles on
all of these and delete them so delete
delete and delete and finally right here
I'm going to hit update in the top right
corner and I'm also going to perfect for
some reason it's just not updating right
here at the top so just know that yours
should get updated at some point here
automatically so don't worry about it
not showing up there for some reason now
in this box here let's think about the
journey for a second somebody is going
to mention you in their story and they
have no idea that you're going to
message them after that so we want to
make a message here that feels a little
bit more natural like hey thanks for
tagging me in your story by the way if
you haven't seen this already I actually
have a free guide on how to Homestead
okay so over here where it says text
this is what we're going to to do right
here at the top I'm going to break it up
because I want the first message to show
up like a regular message because when
you attach a button to a message it
actually bolds the text and makes it a
little bit smaller so all this is going
to show up a little bit funky and we
don't want it to feel spammy or weird or
not native so what we'll do here is we
could say thanks so much for tagging me
in your story um by the way if you and
then I'm going to grab this text here
okay if you want to learn more about how
to start home setting so that you can
achieve true freedom for your family
I'll go with a dot dot dot maybe here
but if dot dot dots are just not in your
brand lingo vocabulary Vibe then you can
totally adjust this to be whatever right
but just for Simplicity sake here what's
going to happen here just to recap I've
split it up into two messages because
the first message right here this first
box is going to show up regular like a
regular Instagram DM this second box
right here because a button is attached
to this gray area this gray area is
going to have slightly Bolder texts and
smaller texts in Instagram it looks the
same here in manyet but once you go into
Instagram you are going to see that
difference so we want this to feel a
little more native because they didn't
ask for this and then we're going to hit
update in the top right corner okay now
what we're going to do is something new
we haven't done done yet so over here on
the left hand side hit settings and then
find the Instagram Channel option right
here once you're in this option go ahead
and find story mention reply and then
hit select existing now if you scroll
down you'll see at the top this is what
we just worked on right story mentions
home setting free guide click into this
hit pick this automation once we do that
click into the box and now you'll see
that this has appeared which I'll talk
about in a moment and then the message
that we just created has also appear so
over here on the left hand side click
into this and then we're going to decide
on what settings we want so the first
setting says send this every time
someone mentions you in their story or
send it every 24 hours so we'll go ahead
and select once per 24 hours so that
somebody is not getting this multiple
times if let's say they happen to tag
you in multiple stories situation like
this could be at a client at an event
and they had 30 other influencers with
them there and then the other
influencers kept tagging them in a bunch
of stories CU they were all at the same
event and the influencers kept getting
the same message over and over and over
right and they're like oh my gosh how do
we not do this well that's because the
setting was not set up correctly by them
and so this is what you can do where
here will select once per 24 hours and
then we actually do want to delay the
automation here because this is not like
a story where they said hey DM me this
word and then I'll send you over this
thing immediately person DMS you the
word they receive it immediately instant
gratification they're happy they opened
it they clicked they're going on with
their Journey this is unasked for and so
we want to make sure that it does feel a
little bit more organic and it's not
like immediate blast you know to
something so we're going to say wait 30
seconds we're also going to like their
message so it's going to wait 30 seconds
like the message and then send a
response to to them which is the
response we just crafted together now
one more thing and again this is a
little bit more advanced you know this
is kind of like yoga right where it's
like hey do this basic yoga move and if
this is a modification you need to take
take the modification this is the same
thing right so if you're feeling like
whoa I'm feeling a little bit stretched
a little bit expanded right now with the
stuff that we're doing leave it at that
I'm going to add a little Advanced
modification in here for you and again
if you're like I want to come back and
do that later great and then we'll get
into the rest of it okay so right here
at the beginning I'm going to drag and
drop this over here I'm going to double
click in this gray area and I am going
to click on the actions button okay now
the ultimate goal of what I'm creating
here is so that we never send this to
the same person more than once ever so
not just within a 24-hour period but
also ever so if someone tags you in
their story today and they tag you in a
month from now they're not getting the
same message both times and that would
be especially crappy feeling if the
person's like I already opted into this
why am I getting this message feels so
impersonal right so if they just get it
the first time great but they don't want
to get it again at least not right now
while this is the only thing that you're
triggering so in this actions box go
ahead and hit plus action and then in
the first tab here it says contact data
then hit add tag go ahead and hit add
tag and now in this section what we're
going to do is hit plus tag which is at
the bottom so we're going to create a
tag a tag will get added to a user's
profile and this now allows us to see if
this person has ever gone through this
automation before so I'm simply going to
say story mention receive okay that's
going to be the name of my tag then go
ahead and hit the create button once you
have done that now over here next to it
I want to click again and hit condition
and now I'm I'm going to say plus
condition here make sure this says all
the following conditions and I'm going
to click on General filters tag and then
the tag you just created should show up
here on this list then I'm going to
click on it and now our condition says
hey if this person has the tag story
mention is received then do these things
that now we're going to decide what to
do here so what we'll do is actually
swap these now I created them in that
order so you could understand but now
we're going to swap them so I'm going to
move this one over to the right and I'm
going to move this one over to the left
and I'm going to kind of align them here
because you know we like symmetry so now
what I'm going to do is click on this
gray Circle that's kind of enlarging as
I'm clicking on it or hovering over it
and then click on it and drag it here
because now as soon as somebody mentions
you in their story we actually want to
go to this step first before we do any
of this stuff now if the tag is story
mention received we're not going to do
anything we're just going to let it ride
here they're not going to receive
anything from us right now if they don't
have it yet then that's when we do want
to send this so we're going to hit on
this red circle here and then click on
the actions box so now immediately if
this person has not received this story
mention before or this tag before they
get the tag and then here we're going to
click on next step and then send them
over to that message and then finally
we're going to hit update in the top
right corner so now to recap what we
just did in this more advanced
modification is that somebody mentions
you in their story this can only happen
once per 24 hours right and then under
delay automation we're going to wait 30
seconds and then we're going to react
with this message um With This Heart and
now if somebody has never received this
they're going to receive this tag and
they're going to receive this message if
they have received this then all of this
still applies so nothing needs to change
here they're just not going to receive
anything after they come in is that is
that all making sense so far that is our
story mentioned reply congratulations on
setting that up I know that that was not
the simplest thing but man it's going to
bring you in so many leads so I'm super
excited for you to have that now let's
go back to our automation Tab and go
back to our original H setting free
guide example here and let's go ahead
and talk about these others the next one
is a direct message we have actually
already set this one up right at its
core so we have these send a message and
send a message where the message is or
the message begins with one additional
thing that you can do here for funsies
and for more leads is over here on the
left handan side where it says settings
go ahead and click into that again go to
the Instagram Channel and in this area
click on conversation starters edit this
is where you could send people to
specific things that you might have
going on so you can see I have a couple
of examples here I'm going to delete
them for a second so that you can see
this from scratch and so what you'll see
is that these conversation starters
can't send people to Links but they can
send people to the automation you're
setting so what we could do is if
somebody goes to message you for the
very first time they have no idea where
they should go or what they should do
next then we could say something like
get your free homesteading guide and
this is the button that they will see
available to them if they go in to
message you for the first time they
don't have any existing conversation
with you so what we can do here is as
soon as you click into this little chat
arrow thing then you can click select
existing we can scroll down again in our
list and click on home setting free
guide hit pick this Automation and then
hit done so now what will happen is over
here on the right hand side what you can
see is somebody comes to your profile
and then they see the button available
and now they can click into it and then
I'm going to hit publish in the top
right we're going to make sure that it's
enabled not disabled abled and now
anytime someone comes into your direct
messages they will see this as a call to
action to dive into your free guide
automation how powerful is that now I
know this has been a little bit lengthy
but I promis you an ultimate guide so
here we are and what we're going to do
next is create the links that you can
set up for your account so over here in
the when box go ahead and click it again
and hit plus new trigger and now we're
going to find the option that says user
clicks a referral link click into that
option there once we're here then we'll
go ahead and simply hit save and now
this URL that you see right here is
going to allow you to send people
directly to this message so if I give
this URL to people in my email on my
website I turn it into a QR code which
is a little bit more of an advanced
modification but still super powerful
then everyone will receive this message
as soon as they come into your DMs
instead of just going to your DMs and
not knowing what to do and one more
thing that you can do here to customize
this and help you also remember what it
is that this sends to is if you click on
additional settings you'll see it says
customize your url so in instead of w25
whatever the heck this says we can say
something like homesteading guide and
then we'll hit save and now this is My
URL to use not the random you know
string of letters and numbers so we've
got three more we have ads broadcast
channels and lives I'm actually going to
go out of order from what I had shared
with you earlier and do ads at the end
just in case ads aren't super relevant
to you right you can do so much with
Organic traffic so I'm going to finish
those up and then we'll get into ads so
the next one I'll show you here is how
to get people who comment on your live
to receive this message so if we click
into our when box right here hit plus
new trigger and then go to this list
then we'll hit user comments on your
live now here is where you will select
the word that we are using on all the
other automations so far so go ahead and
hit plus keyword and then say strategy
Here and Now under message is make sure
that you are selecting messages and then
hit save we're going to do the same
thing that we did earlier with user send
message message is and message begins
with so I'm going to duplicate this
automation that says live comments I
know it's a little small in Gray but
click on that and then same thing I'm
going to click on this and say message
begins with and then hit save so even
though these look the same from afar
right now it says user comments on your
live user comments on your live these
are different and if it helps you when
you click into this one for example you
could say live comments for example
message is and now you actually see that
right here right I could click into this
and I could also rename this one I could
say live comments message begins with
just so you know or if you have other
team members that are going to come into
this or remind yourself even in a week
from now I know that's not that much
time but hey you could completely forget
everything I'm sharing with you right
now because it's said it didn't forget
it you're bringing in so many leads and
sales and then you're like why do I have
two of these let me erase one of them
they must have been a duplicate um
without remembering why we did that so
that's what you'll do for your lives and
finally for your broadcast channels
there's nothing new that you need to
create but you can instead leverage what
you have already built and repurpose it
who doesn't love being able to get more
out of what you have already created so
the two things that you'll be using are
this referral link right here and you
can drop this link into your broadcast
channel to say hey by the way I made
this free home setting guide it is the
ultimate guide I'm so proud and excited
of how it came out I know it's really
going to help you if you want to get
access to it click on this link and I
will send it to you in the DMS that's
all you have to do so you can just send
them that link directly in your
broadcast channel it's clickable they go
from the broadcast channel into your DMs
it's a very seamless user experience and
now you have more leads coming in who
are a part of your broadcast channel
that now can get uh access to your
freebie products Services whatever it is
that you're promoting so now our grand
finale let's go into ads so this one's
going to be a little more multi-step as
well we're going to go back to our
automation tab over here on the left and
then find where we just created a few
things going on so the first thing that
we're going to do is right here we are
going to it'll probably be easier for us
to duplicate our story mentions one so
I'm going to go ahead and duplicate this
one instead of the free guut so if you
hover over this you'll see three circles
appear click on the three circles and
hit duplicate once we have done that
click on this automation here and
instead of story mentions I'm going to
say ads right and then I'm going to
erase that at the end now I'm going to
hit edit Automation in the top right
corner and I'm going to zoom out a
little bit and go over here now I'm
going to erase these two things right
here and how I did that little trick is
that I'm going to hit the shift button
on my keyboard click down with your
mouse and then drag across this area let
go and don't click anywhere but if I
just hover over move my mouse over that
area I can hit the trash icon and then
hit confirm little time-saving hack for
you there from there we'll click on this
then box and then click on this message
right here now that you've connected
this let's set up our wind box so go
ahead and click into the wind box and
hit plus new trigger and hit user clicks
an Instagram ad once you're here it's
going to give you a couple of
instructions right here so now what you
will do is hit the save button and over
here we're going to slightly deconstruct
this message so I'm going to duplicate
this box right here and hit the
duplicate button drag over here and then
I'm going to remove this first message
now in this first box right here I'm
then going to delete the second box okay
you see what's happening right we have
now two boxes with two separate messages
reason why we have to do that is because
people have to click on something in the
first box here in order to go over to
the next uh button here so we're going
to go ahead and say instead of thanks so
much for tagging me in your story we
could do something similar to what we
did before right where we're like hi you
know can't wait for you to learn more
learn more about how to start home
settings so that you can achieve two
freedom for your family add our little
emoji and then we can say just click the
button below and I'll send over the link
to my ultimate free guide now we have to
do this based on how these particular
ads function there are many ways to
approach ads but this will be an easy
way for you to do it initially and I'll
have a whole other video going over this
because honestly there is so much to
this that again there's so many
different versions of this how you want
to do it for different types of
campaigns but for right now I'll just
show you how to set this up so now we'll
go ahead and hit add quick reply and
then we'll add a note here that says
send it over we're actually going to do
that instead of saying get access
because that's what we're saying is send
over so now this button right here this
circle needs to be attached here just to
be clear it is not the next step button
it is the send it over one so you should
see exactly what I'm showing you right
now and then we can say at the end of
this awesome can't wait for you to dive
in your last step is to click the button
below and I'll give you your guide on
the next page now the reason why we're
doing this is because we want to get the
data on how many people have clicked on
this button here you don't want to give
people just a link directly in the
messages especially if they're coming
from Adra traffic because you want to
track how many clicks you got over to
your page and then on the next page you
may be able to track those insights
otherwise let's say that I'm sending
people to a free guide here which means
I would probably take them to a landing
page something like if I go over to one
of our landing pages there is going to
be right a box there's going to be a
first name an email address and so on
the next page you will get this data
from your landing page software where
they'll tell you here's how many people
actually converted out of the number of
visitors so if you can see from here hey
here's how many people clicked on the
button in then you can say oh great then
this number of visitors came from my
Automation and then you can actually
track the conversion rate that way from
there so that's what we'll do for ads
you'll hit update in the top right
corner and once that's good to go then
I'm going to click on these ads once
again and then I'm going to walk you
through the rest of these steps real
quick right now your last step to
connect this to your ads will be to go
into your ads manager and if you click
learn more right here then you'll be
able to see how many chat says to set
this up in your ads manager like I said
I strongly feel that I need to make an
entire video on this because there are
so many specific things that we do for
ads and I don't want to make this video
another two hours long so I'm going to
hold off and do that in a different
video to just serve you best but in the
meantime this article from many chat
will show you how to connect this simple
automation we've created to your ads so
you can get this live immediately as
soon as you finish building this but
then from there we can go a lot deeper
in another video now everything that we
have just set up right now is what we
call DM Automation and there is a more
advanced strategy that we call a chap
funnel and while it's more advanced it's
not necessarily more complex to set up
we've just spent more time honing it and
refining it and get far better results
with it and that's actually the secret
behind all of this that's how we collect
emails at an 85% or higher rate how we
make our clients millions of dollars
using these strategies so in the next
couple of videos that I'll be putting
out I'll walk you through how to set
those up how they work the types of
results that you can expect and just
lots of examples so you can get
inspiration for how to set it up for
yourself so for now if you want to
subscribe to see those videos go ahead
and do that so that you can be the first
to see them as soon as they're out I
appreciate you thanks so much for
watching
