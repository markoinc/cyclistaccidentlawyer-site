hey what's up y'all this is Clayton from
Roseanne and in this video I'm going to
be showing you how you can make a very
simple automated SMS text messaging
follow-up sequence so you can get your
clients or customers to respond book a
call um you know buy next product have a
conversation whatever you want to do you
can this all automated inside rosan so
let me show you how it works all right
so if you're in Rosanne and you come
over to your automations and you can
create an automation so this is a way to
create kind of like an autoresponder of
sorts so when give it a name um I'm
going to select uh just single entry
meaning like people can only go through
this uh sequence once and then a cool
feature that we have is this uh stop on
contact response so often in an
autoresponder you have a series of
questions trying to follow up with
people trying to get them to respond and
what this will do is if they respond it
will just take them out of the sequence
so they don't keep getting the hey what
about this uh and then when they respond
you can just pick up the conversation in
the conversations tab um over here and
uh you can have your SDR or salesperson
or yourself you can uh actually do the
the one-on-one chatting there so this is
just a follow-up sequence so you could
go ahead and create that automation I
actually have one already set up so I'll
just show you kind of what that looks
like so I have this follow-up sequence
here and so you can come in here and
you'll see uh I have a whole sequence of
follow-up messages um to go so I'll just
show you a couple of these the first
thing is you have a trigger so in this
case uh you know the trigger is when a
tag is added so this is very common you
you can trigger off multiple different
things when you receive a message when a
contact tag is added or removed when
they're subscribed to a list they click
a link so you can get contacts in here
and start this sequence um lots of
different ways um so what the first
thing that happens is when they enter
the sequence they get uh first message
that says hey first name this is Clayton
from Roseanne I saw you opted in our
into our website uh are you looking to
get started with text message marketing
or are you already using it so in the
first message often what I recommend is
just trying to get a response you don't
necessarily need them to tell you their
live story or ask them a really hard
question just try to say like hey even
even a good question is like uh hey is
this the right number for first name
right just trying to get a response um
so that goes out right when they opt in
then I have a wait step here um it's
going to wait a day then it's going to
follow up and say something again it's
going to uh ask uh it's Clayton from
Roseanne we've been helping Business
Like Yours boost the results by simply
plugging in automated SMS marketing can
we schedule a quick call to show you how
it could work for you just follows up
again and then it just continues to do
that for a few days and remember again
because I had that option selected um
you know if if they do respond it's
going to stop following up with them and
then I can pick up that conversation uh
over in the conversations tabs and go
back for back and forth oneone and so
yeah you can just customize this however
You' like um I actually have a whole
sequence template that you can use I'm
going to link it down in the description
and um that that's a simple sequence
that you know demonstrates the value you
provide it shows social proof it handles
objections all that kind of stuff you
can swipe that um but yeah this is just
a very simple sequence um you can do a
lot more stuff with automations as well
you can even do conditionals so you come
in here and do an if else Branch uh if
you want to get fancy and check to see
if maybe they booked a call or did they
buy a product and then split off the
different automations um for either one
of those so lots of different stuff you
can do in here but if you want an easy
way to start engaging your contacts
getting more people to that opt in to
actually respond to you engage and you
know hopefully Ascend to your um to your
other products book a call whatever you
want them to do this is a very simple
way you can completely automate it and
just have it running all the time just
engaging your contacts so uh if you need
any help getting this set up let me know
