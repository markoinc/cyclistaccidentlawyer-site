In this video, I'm going to show you
exactly how I built a lead research and
qualifying AI agent inside of Nen that
starts with a form that the lead would
fill out with their name, email, and
company website. Then we use an AI agent
to do extensive research. Then we score
the lead. Then we add them to our CRM
before sending an email to our team
based on the type of lead that we get.
And in case it's your first time here,
my name is Mikuel and over the past 12
months, I've helped over 40 businesses
implement AI and automations and taught
over 20,000 people in the [music]
process. All starting with zero
technical knowledge. So I'm going to
show you everything step by step and if
you stick around until the end, I'll
even show you how you can get the whole
system for free. With that being said,
let's dive in. All right. So this right
here is a full workflow and it has four
different steps with two different AI
agents. I'm going to press execute
workflow to start the actual process.
I'm going to put my full name, Mikuel
Torti. [music]
Company domain. Let's put my website.
Yep. All good. And then my LinkedIn
profile. So LinkedIn. And I can go to my
profile and I can get the URL right
here. and I can paste it here. And now I
can press start research. When I press
start research, what it does is that it
goes to the first AI agent which is a
lead and company research agent. So this
is the thing that we use to actually do
in-depth research which means that it
goes inside the website, inside the
LinkedIn, it looks at the [music] name
and if pretty much finds any information
out there in the internet about this
company and person and gives you a full
detailed report. And as you can see
here, we're using two perplexity tools.
One for the actual research mainly on
the website and the other one using the
LinkedIn. And the reason why we're
actually looping around and around is
because of the fact that we're doing
multiple pieces of research. So, as you
can see here, we have about five. And
it's because we're not only doing
research on one aspect of the actual
company, but multiple aspects of the
company. Once this is done, it sends it
to the next AI agent, which scores the
lead out of 70. And then finally, it
adds it to our CRM. And then we get an
email at the end. And the CRM looks like
this. And as we can see here, we have
the date, the email, the name of the
company, whether the person is a
decision maker or not. It's true. in
this case company name revenue which in
this case is not publicly disclosed but
it estimates that it's about 1 to 10
employees then we have the interest
summary which is again what do they
actually do based on the website then we
have potential company solutions which
is based on what I do in my company how
can I help well obviously my company so
because we work in the AI sector and we
help companies implement AI then
obviously tells us to integrate AI
powered lead qualification or outreach
system which is pretty ironic
considering that's what we're doing
today um but CRM project management lead
generation content creation and email
automation. And of course, if you want
to change this to what you guys do, then
obviously we'll look at the prompt that
we give the AI agent. You can [music]
simply just switch out what you do. And
then finally, we have a score. Now, the
score again is out of 100 that we use.
And in this case, because it's a lead
that has a score of 65, we get an email
saying that it's a warm lead. So, warm
lead, score 65. And we get all the
information, which is company, lead
name, monthly revenue, AI, interest, and
recommended solutions. Now the format of
this is not perfect and we also have to
delete the N10 attribution. That's what
this is called which is where N10 just
puts themselves into your email. Of
course the format of this is not
perfect. So we're going to tweak that in
the actual workflow. So there there is
exactly how it works. Let's go to the
first step which is the N10 form. So
this is where a potential lead will fill
out the form. And the form itself as you
can see here when I press execute step
it will ask us for our name, our company
domain and LinkedIn profile URL. Now, in
this case, I should have put required
for all three, but it's only required
for the company domain as of right now.
And it's going to ask us for a full
name, company domain, and LinkedIn
profile URL, which when I submit, it
goes here, right? And we have this set
up using the form title, form
description. And then we start adding
the form elements, which are the
questions that we ask the person to fill
out uh when using the form. And in this
case, the field name will be full name.
The element will be text area. We can
change [music] this to text because text
area is when you want to put some sort
of paragraph, not a very small sentence.
In this case, because it's just a full
name, it's going to be a small sentence.
Uh I mean one sentence, I can put this
as required because we need this company
domain and placeholder as well is
something that they see before they fill
it out. Right? So if I see that I have
to fill out a company domain and on the
actual answer I see as an example
example.com, then it gives me an idea as
to what to fill out. And then we have
LinkedIn profile URL which again is a
text field and the placeholder will be
LinkedIn profile URL which is optional.
Now it's optional because not everyone
has LinkedIn. So the lead can decide
whether to add it or not. Now once this
is done, we can see here that we have
the output which is full name, company
domain, profile URL and the date of
submission. We can go to the next step
which is the lead and company research
agent. So we can see here that this is
connected to two different tools which
are done for research using perplexity.
And as we can see here we have the user
prompt which is giving it the company
domain, the full name and the LinkedIn
profile URL which is something that
changes with every single lead form
submission. And then we have the system
message. So, if I go here, you can see
that this is a pretty in-depth prompt,
very detailed. And the way it actually
works is if I go up here, we have the
overview. So, you're saying, "Hey,
you're an expert lead intelligence
analyst specializing in AI agency sales
and implementation readiness because
that's what we do." So, obviously, if
your company's different, then you would
substitute this. And then we start
giving it instructions. So, research
tools and mandatory usage, internal data
sources to use, [music] core analytics
tasks, and a bunch more other stuff that
he uses for the actual research. And so
at the end I'm going to show you exactly
how you can get the whole system for
free. So you [music] can take this whole
prompt and use it for yourself. Um and
you can have it right here. And so with
this prompt we are able to then do the
research which gives us the output which
is date, email, lead name, JM solutions
which is the company name which I didn't
give it right u monthly revenue which in
this case it can't find and align
interest which is JM solutions shows
strong AI interest focus on workflow
automations. And what this is is
basically a way for us to understand
whether the company itself is interested
in what we do. And then finally we have
potential company solutions. And the
potential company solutions is what can
we provide the company with? How can we
help them? And it gives us a few ideas
here. And then we have decision maker
true or false. If it's true that means
this person right here who filled out
the form is the decision maker of the
company. If not then it's going to be
false. And this right here of course is
connected to its brain which is the LLM
which is open AAI which you can connect
up here. Create a new credential. So you
can go to platform.openai.com.
You can go to the dashboard. You can go
to API keys and right here you can
create a new one and then copy and then
paste it here and you'll be good to go.
And then we have two different tools.
The first one is perplexity research
tool. And this right here is a tool
that's used when we are researching the
company. And in this case we're
researching the company website by
giving it the company domain. And so to
actually connect your perplexity you
have to go to create a new credential.
And this tool is used to be able to
research the actual company uh website,
right? Not the actual LinkedIn, just the
company website. And so the first step
here is actually connecting your
account. So you can go to create a new
credential. You can go to perplexity.ai.
And if it's your first time hearing
about Perplexity, Perplexity is sort of
like Chad GBT, but it's well known for
research, right? And so you want to go
down to account, go to APIs, go to API
and billing down here. And you're going
to have to add credits first. So add
money because it's not free of course
but it only realistically takes about
0.001 cents and then if you go to API
keys you can create a new secret key. So
accept put a name. So I can put test and
then you will have the key right here
that you [music] can copy. Once it's
copied you can go back here and you can
paste it here and you'll be able to
connect your account. Once this is done
this will be set manually. The
description will be message and model in
perplexity. Just leave it as a default.
uh the operation which is what is the
action that we're taking is messaging a
model. The model that we're using is
called sonar. Sonar is a pretty good
model. It doesn't take too long but also
is very good at research. And then here
we give it two different types of
prompts. One is a system prompt which is
what is the identity and in this case
we're just toggling this on which means
that we're telling AI hey you decide the
system prompt and the other one is a
text prompt. Now the text prompt in this
case will be just the company domain. So
it knows using the system prompt what it
needs to do. And now the user prompt
like before is just the variable that it
needs to use to be able to do those
certain things that we tell it in the
system prompt. Once this is done, then
we can see here that we have the
citations and we have the results. So we
have the snippet and a bunch of other
stuff that it uses to be able to then do
research on the next part of the person
which is the LinkedIn research. So same
exact concept. Everything else is the
same. The only difference is that here I
should have put LinkedIn URL. We give it
the LinkedIn URL. And this is more so on
a personal level. Right. So, you can see
here it started scraping my LinkedIn. My
Gumroad, I don't know how I got to here,
but my Gumroad is where I store a ton of
my automations. You can see here
make.com and N10. If you have not
checked it out, the link is up here. And
a bunch more other stuff like this. And
so this right here does more of the
personal research and this more of the
company research to then be able to
structure the output like this to get
the date, email, lead name, company
name, monthly revenue, AI interest and
potential company solutions and then
decision maker as well. And this is
basically us asking the AI to gather all
the information and then structure it in
a way where it looks like this. And we
use JSON because JSON is the language
that we use behind all the automations.
If you don't know what JSON is, check
out this video up here. I always have a
video for something. So there you go.
Um, okay. Now once this is done, we can
see that the output here is the date,
email, lead name, company name, monthly
revenue, AI interest, potential company
solutions, and decision maker. So we can
go to the next step, which is a lead
scoring agent. Now, this right here is
hooked up to the actual brain, which is
the LLM, and it's hooked up to the
output structure. And the only thing
that we really want out of the output is
a score. Now, if I go here to the actual
prompt, uh we give it the I shouldn't
give it the additional context because
it's not an actual field, but we give it
the output, we give it the uh company
domain, the AI interest, potential
company solutions, and monthly revenue.
And so based on all these fields, we're
going to score it out of 100 and we give
it a scoring criteria. So revenue
requirement 0 to 30 points, must be
generating at least 50k per month. And
this will give us um one point, right?
And so by doing that in specific, you
give it a few scoring criterias, some
sort of rules that it uses when giving
you a score out of 100 right here. And
so we say, "You're a lead qualification
specialist for an AI agency. Score this
lead based on their fit for an AI
implementation service." And so right
here, you can see that the output is 65,
which is the score of the actual lead.
Now, once this is done, then we can use
Google Sheets, which is a CRM that we
have right here, to be able to add the
lead details in this row. And all we did
here is just connected a Google sheet
account like this. Sign in with Google
and you have that there. Then we have
resource which is sheet within the
document operation which is what is the
action that we're taking which is
appending a row which means adding a
row. Then the document will be the
Google sheet which is the lead research
analyst and then it will be sheet one
and then all these fields are the ones
that we map from here. You can see date,
email, lead name, decision maker you can
find right here. Company name, company
name, revenue, revenue. There we go. uh
infra summary which is infra summary
here potential company solutions right
here and then finally we have the score
which you can get up here and so by
putting everything in one place our team
has a record of all the different leads
that have submitted the form all the
different sort of revenue summaries and
company names and so on and also the
score of each lead so when we want to go
back to the CRM for whatever reason we
can see all the leads that we've had in
the past all categorized by the actual
score now what we do here at the end is
we actually notify our team but we don't
want to notify our team every single
time with this same exact email. We want
to notify our team differently based on
the type of leads. And so what we do
here is we use the root so the split and
we say hey if the output so if the score
which you can find right here put so if
the score right here is greater than or
equal to 70 then we call it a hot lead.
If it's greater than or equal to 40 then
a warm lead and then [music] if it's
less than 40 it will be a cold lead. And
so that's how the automation works to
then be able to send three different
emails based on the different type of
scoring that we get. In this case, the
hot lead would just be an email here,
which is very similar. All we have to do
here is just connect our account, sign
in with Google. Same exact concept as
before. And the actual email will be
sent to $100 million peanuts@gmail.com.
If you know, you know. And here we have
the hot lead alerts score is the actual
score of the lead. And then for the
email type, we can see here that we send
over the company name, the lead name,
the email, monthly revenue, AI interest,
and recommended solutions. And one thing
I'm going to do, I'm going to turn this
back to text. So it's formatted in the
right way, I think. And then, as you can
see here, this is the one that it
actually used. Same exact emails. The
only difference is that we give the warm
lead instead of hot lead. So we know
just by the subject line if this lead is
warm or hot. And we can also tag them.
It's also one additional step that we
can do is we can tag the email maybe by
having something here. We can say warm
leads
and we can have all the warm leads be
tagged here. All the hot leads being
tagged in the other place and so on. And
so same exact concept here. We do the
exact same thing and we get an email
that looks like this. Warm lead score
65. And we have the full description of
the actual company. And finally, we have
the cold lead, which is the cold lead
right here. And we send the exact same
thing. I'm going to turn this to text.
