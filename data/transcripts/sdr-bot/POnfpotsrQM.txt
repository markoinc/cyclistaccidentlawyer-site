# Category: followup

What is up guys? Welcome back to another
video. In this video, I'm going to show
you how to create a simple workflow that
auto sends personalized responses to
prospects. Creating it right here in
any. So, let's get started. So, in any
I've created a workflow that I've named
to follow-up generator. And here we're
going to add a trigger. Since we're
capturing
email responses from prospects, I'm
going to search for Gmail here to add a
trigger. Now, I'm going to click on
Gmail. And our trigger is going to be a
non-M message received trigger here.
You'll need to create a new credential
to connect Gmail 2010 by signing in with
your Google account right here. And then
on the new window that pops up, choose
the account that you like to connect
2010. And then your credential will be
created. Since I had already done that,
I'm going to close this right here. And
then for the mode here, you can choose
when you'd like to run this trigger. So
you can choose to run it every minute,
every hour, every day, every week, every
month. I'll customize it right here. The
event will be a message received. Okay.
So here we can try sending a message to
a prospect and then replying it. So we
can capture the response here in our
trigger. So to do that
I'm going to send this example
outreach email to an example client of
right. So the email is on the lines of
high. I run L automation where I design
workflows that eliminate manual task and
free up hours every week instead of
chasing spreadsheets, emails. Emails are
repetitive client updates. I build
system that handle the busy work so we
can focus on growth. Teams I've worked
with have seen faster client onboarding,
smoother follow-ups and better
visibility across operations all without
adding extra headcount which will be to
a quick chart. So I can show you what
this could look like in your business.
And then here we can decide to send this
email to a prospect. Here is the email
that we sent to the prospect. Now we can
decide to reply to this prospect. This
message similar to this one right here.
So we're saying thanks for reaching out.
What you described sounds really useful.
You've definitely been spending too much
time on manual processes. I'll be
interested in learning more about how
Lmetric could help streamline things for
us. Do you have availability next week
for a call? So here, this could be the
response that our client is sending to
us. After we send them this outreach
message, we're going to generate a
workflow that automatically responds to
our prospect after they've already
replied to our call email or our
outreach message. In our workflow here,
I'll click on fetch test event.
And then here you can see we're getting
a snippet of our email response that our
client responded with. So here I'll turn
this to off to get the full email. Now
here you can see the full email right
here that they sent us. So we can use
the we can pin this data
and use it to set up our workflow. So
now the the next thing that we can do
here we can wait for let's say 3 seconds
here. Then here name this to wait 3
seconds
and execute it right here.
Now the next thing that we're going to
do here is we're going to clean our
you know from maybe emojis
lines or any other or all these other
information we getting right here. So we
would like only to get only what the
client responded with.
So we can generate the personalized
response them for them. So to clean our
client's response we're going to use AI.
So here I'm going to click on open AI
not here. Then click on message a model.
Yeah, you'll need to also create a
credential like we did with Gmail by
clicking on create a new credential.
Then from your open AI API add a key
right here. Then click on save to create
your credential. Since I had already
done that, I'm going to close it. And
here I'm going to choose a model. Choose
the latest model right here. Latest
model is GP5. The latest model that
we're using currently.
I'm going to choose 4.1. It's more
favorable one. And here we're going to
add a prompt for the user role.
prompt copy the lines of you're an
assistant that cleans email replies here
I'll add a message and I add a prompt
for the user here
so the input will be a full client email
that may contain signatures previous
message threads disclaimers or automatic
photos and here we adding the response
our client's email over here adding it
to the text over here then we're telling
the AI remove signatures for example
name job titles phone numbers best
regards etc we also like the AI to
remove quoted previous message. So this
is quoted message right here. We'll also
like to remove disclaimers or
confidentiality notice. We also like to
remove breaks and new lines and return
only the call message client wrote in
plain text. The output should be a clean
client response only. No extra
formatting or explanation. So here I'll
click on back to canvas and turn this
option to on. And then I'll click on
execute step right here. And now you can
see we're getting our cleaned client
response over here without any emojis,
disclaimers or all the other information
that we eliminated using our AI node
over here. So I'll click on back to
convers here and here. I rename this to
client response cleaner. The next thing
that we're going to do here is we're
going to wait a few seconds. For
example, we can wait let's say 2
seconds.
Okay. Then I can rename this to wait 2
seconds.
I click on rename. The next thing that
we're going to do here is we cleaned our
client response from here. We're going
to now analyze the sentiment of the
client and then we're going to either
categorize it as a positive, neutral or
negative. So to analyze the client's
response,
we're going to also use AI. So in AI,
I'm going to click on open AI right
here. Then I'll click on message.
It will first of all need to execute
this previous node.
Then here I'll open this node. And then
here we're going to choose our
credential. Then our model I'm going to
choose GP4.1
right here. Then here to add a system ro
then I click on expression it right here
and add this prompt which is on the
lines of a system that classifies client
email responses into sentiment
categories. And here converse then add a
message and add the prompt for the user
ro over here. Expand it here and the
brown command line here. So here we're
going to start by adding the clean
client response. Then we're telling the
AI analyze the tone and intent of the
client's response. Then classify the
sentiment into exactly one of these
categories, positive, neutral, or
negative. So we like to classify the
response as positive if the client is
interested, agreeable, or open to the
next steps. We also like to classify the
client's response to neutral if the
client is uncertain, asking for more
information, or non-committal. And
lastly, like to classify the response as
negative if the client is not
interested, declining or dismissive. And
we'll only like to output
the sentiment is either positive,
neutral or negative. So here all output
content is a JSON. Then here I'll click
on execute step to analyze our client
response right here. You can see it was
a positive
response. So here I'll click on back to
canvas and here I'll rename this to to
sentiment analysis. Then click on rename
right here. Now the next thing that
we're going to do here is we're going to
use a switch node to switch between the
classifications. So here I'll search for
a switch node right here. Then click on
it.
So here if the sentiment is equal to
positive
we like to rename it to positive then
if the sentiment is equal to neutral
want to rename it to neutral and lastly
if the sentiment is uh equal to negative
Rename
it to negative. And here we can execute
step. You can see our sentiment was in
the positive branch right here. So now
we can set up our positive
branch right here. So here can wait a
few seconds. For example, we can wait
let's say
4 seconds. Yeah, I rename this to wait 4
seconds.
and click on rename.
Now the next thing that we're going to
do here is we're going to generate a
custom reply to our prospects response.
So I'm going to use AI. I'm going to use
open AI and then here click on message
the model node.
Here we can first of all execute these
steps
and we can go back to our model over
here. I'm going to choose our model.
Choose 4.1. And here we're going to add
a prompt for the system ro.
The prompt is is on the lines of you're
an assistant that writes professional
but friendly sales follow-ups. And here
we can add a prompt for the user role
here. The prompt could be on the lines
of the prospect has responded positively
and show and shown interest in
automation services.
Then here we adding their response.
Then you're telling the agent
acknowledge their interest and suggest a
clear next step. For example, scheduling
a call, quick demo sharing availability.
Keep the tone professional, approachable
and concise. Do not include greetings
like hi prospects or any placeholders.
Do not use dashes and sign off as Dennis
from N automation. So here I'll click on
back to canvas right here. And then here
I like to output the content as JSON.
Then here I'll click on execute step.
You can see now it generated for us this
very personalized reply to a prospect's
response. This is incredible. So here
I'll click on back to converse right
here.
Then then here I'll rename this to
posive reply. Then click on rename. And
now we can reply to the prospect.
So here you can wait let's say a few
seconds in case we're sending
multi multiple emails.
to prospects. So we don't want to
overwhelm Gmail. So
then here I search for Gmail and then
I'll click on reply to a message node
like we did here. We're going to execute
self first.
Then I'll go back to Gmail and here
we're going to add a message ID. So in
Gmail trigger I'll drag the ID right
here type. I'm going to choose text.
Then the message will be this message
that we generated right here. Then I
click on execute step to send a message.
Add options. I'm going to click on
append in attribution. Turn it off.
Then I can send the respon the reply to
a prospect.
This is incredible. The last thing that
we're going to do here is we're going to
log in the client response. And the
reply that we generated using our
workflow to a database.
In your table, I've created a database
that I've named to follow our payment
base. And then in this table is where
we're going to add our client responses.
You're going to add the client's name,
their email status, which can either be
positive, negative, or neutral. Then the
client response that they responded to
our outreach email. Then the follow-up
reply that we generated using our
workflow. Okay, in case our team would
like to come in and
check the responses that our work is
sending to our prospects. So now to log
in our
responses from here to this base. Yeah,
I'm going to search for air table.
Then here click on create a record.
Yeah, you also need to create a
credential like we did previously with
other nodes by clicking on create a new
credential. Then add your access token
right here. Then click on save to create
your credential. Since I had already
done that, I'm going to choose my
credential right here. Then here I'm
going to choose our base. Our base is
choose the follow base. The table will
be the client response table. And here
we're going to map values to our columns
in our table with the data from our
workflow. So the client email, we're
going to grab the client email, the
client name and email from the email
that they sent us right here. So I'll
map the name right here
and the email set. Since this is a
positive branch, I'm going to choose
positive client response will be this
text that they sent us right here. And
lastly, we're going to add the followup
that we're sending them,
which is this email follow up right
here.
Then I'll click on execute step to add
our dig to our B. Now when I open our B,
you can see we added a new record right
here. We added a client, the email set
is positive, the client sent us, and the
followup that we generated using our
workflow and sent. So our positive
branch works perfectly.
I have the neutral and the negative
branch. We're going to follow the same
process that we did right here. The only
thing that we're going to change is this
node where now it's going to generate
a different response to the prospect. So
instead of having to manually set up
like we did with uh the positive branch
and they're all going to be the same, we
can try to duplicate
these nodes
a couple of times. So this one will be
for the neutral. Can try duplicating
this one again.
And this will be for the negative
right here. Then we can auto align it.
Now we can autoign our workflow right
here. And now the only thing we're going
to change is the pro prompt for our
neutral and our negative
nodes right here. Let me do that.
I've changed the prompt of this node
over here. So the system prompt is on
the lines of you're an assistant that
writes professional but friendly says
follow-ups. Then the prompt for the user
roles on the lines of
the prospect has responded with a
neutral message that shows uncertaintity
or request for more details about
automation services and guiding our
prospects response. Then instructing AI
to politely acknowledge their response
provide clarity by by briefly explaining
the value of lax automations services in
simple terms. Then would like the AI to
suggest a light next step such as
sharing a short example, sending over
details or scheduling a quick call.
The agent should also keep the tone
professional, approachable and concise.
That's why instructing the AI not to
include greetings like hi, prospect
name. Also like not to include dashes
and we like to sign off as from
automation. So that is a prompt for the
usual
reply response. Then for the negative
reply response, the system prompt is on
the lines of you're an assistant that
writes professional but respectful sales
follow-ups. And then the user prompt is
on the lines of the prospect has
responded with a negative message
indicating they're not interested in
automation services. Then here we're
inputting the client's
response. Then we instructing the AI to
acknowledge their response respectfully.
We also like to thank them for their
time and consideration. We'll also like
to leave the door open for future
contact without pushing for a meeting.
We also like to keep the tone polite,
professional, and concise. We'll also
like not to include greetings like hi
prospects and dashes in our email. And
then we would like to send off as Dennis
from automation here. And then so those
are the prompts for
AI nodes right here that that are
responsible for generating personalized
responses to our prospects. Then we're
waiting a few seconds. Then here we're
replying to the prospects over here. So
instead generating the custom message,
we're going to map it right here. And
then the only thing that I will change
on this air table node is the status. So
for the neutral response, we're going to
choose the status as neutral here. And
then for the negative, we're going to
change it to negative over here.
And here I'll click on back to canvas
here. So now we can try executing our
workflow to test it.
Now to test our workflow here, we're
going to unpin this data. We can try
sending
a response as a a neutral response as a
client. Here we're going to assume this
is a outreach message that we sent to
one of our prospects and we're going to
reply with a neutral response. So the
the neutral response come in the lines
of I appreciate you reaching out. I'm
not sure if automation is something
we'll be ready to commit right now. I'll
be open to seeing what kind of processes
usually set up and how they could apply
to our business. So I'll send this
message right here. And then in our
workflow I'm going to click on execute
workflow over here.
Here we can see that our workflow was
executed successfully. When I open this
node over here, you can see we captured
our neutral response from a prospect. So
here's a neutral response and then we
waited a few seconds. Then we clean the
response within using this node right
here. But we only outputed their
response, the clean response. Then we
wait a few seconds to analyze the
sentiment using this node here. The
sentiment was neutral.
Then we wait a few seconds to generate a
neutral response. A response to the
prospects. And here is a custom response
that we generated using this node right
here.
Then we wait a few seconds to send the
reply to our prospect using this node
right here. You can see it was sent and
then we logged in the client data the
response and the response that we
generated using our node to our
database. Here you can see the custom
response that we generated using our
workflow that we send the prospect. The
response that our workflow generated for
us is on the lines of thank you for your
response and interest in our automation
services. Lax automation helps
streamline repetitive tasks and
integrate different tools so your team
can save time and focus on high value
work. For example, you can automate
daily reports or client follow-ups with
just a few clicks. I'll be happy to
share a brief case study or schedule a
quick call to discuss your specific
needs. Let me know which option works
best for you. Best regards Dennis from
Lax Automation. Now when you open our
database, we can see we update we added
a new record right here. So we added the
client name address status was neutral
since our sentiment after analyzing the
sentiment which was classified as
neutral here. Then we added the client
response and the followup email that we
generated using our workflow here to our
database. So our neutral branch works
perfectly. Let us try testing the
negative branch. Let's see if our
negative branch works.
Yeah, I'm going to send an a negative
response as a prospect. So here we're
going to add this response which is on
the lines of we not we're not interested
in your services. Please remove us from
your list and do not contact us again.
So I'll send this message and then here
I'll click on execute workflow. There's
our workflow.
Here we can see that our workflow was
executed successfully. So when I open
this node here, you can see we captured
the email response from a from our
prospect. Yeah. Then we wait a few
seconds. Then here we clean the response
using this node right here.
Then we wait a few seconds and analyze
the sentiment using this node. The
sentiment was labeled as negative. Then
here it was switched to the negative
branch where we waited a few seconds and
generated a custom
reply to this prospect right here, this
response and then wait a few seconds to
send the reply to our prospect and and
then logged in the client response and
the response that we generated using our
workflow to our database email. You can
see the response that our workflow
generated for us over here after we sent
this negative response as a prospect.
The response that is generated for us is
on the lines of thank you for letting me
know and for considering our automation
services. I appreciate your time and I
understand that that this may not be the
right fit at the moment. If your needs
change in the future, I will be able to
reconnect and provide any information
you might need as regards Dennis using
our workflow.
And now when I open our database, you
can see we added a new record here. So
we so here we added the client name, the
email, the status this time around was
negative. We also added the response
that the prospect sent and the reply
that the workflow generated and sent the
prospect here.
this workflow that we created here in
any gen. Let us try testing the positive
branch to test it. Yeah, I'm going to
send
a positive response as a prospect could
be the lines of I'm very interested in
your services. Later is exactly what we
need and I want to move forward as soon
as possible. Then here, please send me
your availability so we can book a call
right away. So here I'll send the
message and then here I'll click on
execute workflow to test our workflow.
Here we can see that our workflow was
executed successfully. Yeah, captured
the positive response that we got from
one of our prospects.
here. So, the positive response was on
here. It's on the lines of I'm
interested in your services. Last
information is exactly what we need and
I want to move forward as soon as
possible. Please send me your
availability so we can book a call right
away. Then here we're waiting a few
seconds and then we're cleaning the
client's response from here using this
node.
Then we're waiting a few seconds. Then
we're analyzing the client's sentiment
using this node right here. The
sentiment was a positive sentiment. Then
here, then here we are switching to the
positive branch. Then where we're
waiting a few seconds to generate a a
custom response to this prospect. Here's
the email that we're sending to our
prospect that we generated using this
not here. Then we're waiting a few
seconds to send the reply to the
prospect. Then we're logging in the
response to our database here. Here is a
custom response that we're sending to
our prospect that we generated using our
workflow. The response is on the lines
of thank you for your enthusiasm and for
considering automation. I'm thrilled to
hear our solutions align your needs. I'm
available this week for a call and I can
offer time slots on on Tuesday at 10:00
a.m. or Thursday at 2 p.m. Please let me
know which options work best for you or
suggest a time that fits your schedule.
Looking forward to discussing how we can
help streamline your operations here.
Besides sharing the time that you're
available, we can also share a
calendarly link with this prospect. So
we can define that in our in our node
right here. Now in our database you can
see we added a new record over here. So
we added the client name, client email,
the status of both saved. We also added
the client response show the positive
response. And then lastly, we added the
reply that we generated using our
workflow right here
using the simple workflow that we
created here in any gen. So our workflow
works perfectly. Here we are capturing a
prospect response that is sent to us
after we sent them an outreach message.
Then we're waiting a few seconds
to clean the response using this node
over here. Then we're waiting a few
seconds to analyze their sentiment from
their response. Then using the switch
node switching from positive, negative
or neutral depending on the sentiment
depending on their sentiment that we
analyze using this node. And then we're
waiting a few seconds to generate a
custom reply to the prospect's response
using these nodes over here. Then we're
waiting a few seconds and then sending
the and then sending the reply to our
prospect using Gmail. Then we're logging
in the responses that our client sent us
and the one that we sent them to to a
database in their table. And this is the
database that we are adding the custom
response and the client response over
here. So here we adding the client name,
the email status, the client response
and the custom reply that we generated
using our workflow over here. Our
workflow works perfectly. Now, if you'd
like me to create this workflow for you,
just click the first link in the
description to schedule a call with me
on the call. We're going to discuss into
details the workflow that you like me to
create, create for you or your business,
and then I'll proceed to create the
workflow for you. But if you enjoy the
video and you have a workflow or an AI
agent that you like me to create using
any 10, just comment down below in the
comment section. I read all the comments
and if I land on your comment and I find
it intriguing, I'll come back on a
future video showing you how to create
the entire workflow or AI agent from
scratch using any. But for now, thank
you for watching and I'll see you in the
next video. Goodbye.
