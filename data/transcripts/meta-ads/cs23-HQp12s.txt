In one of my previous videos, I talked
about a specific strategy that is
crashing right now thanks to the meta
newest update gem at Andromeda. This
strategy is basically built to perform
specifically for this new update. We
have tested the first with one clients
and during October, November, we have
rolled out this strategy also for all of
our clients and we've seen amazing
results as you can see right now on the
screen. And so in this video, I
basically want to show you exactly how
the strategy works and what are the
steps from A to Zed that we follow to
actually create ads that meet this new
strategy that we actually call
sequencing creative strategy. Let me now
jump on my screen so I can show you
exactly what I'm talking about. So uh
this is what we call the sequencing
creative strategy that's delivering uh 3
4x for our e-commerce clients. No one is
talking about this yet. right now
November 25th and uh guarantee that more
people will actually start using this
strategy because it's literally just
printing for ads. Those are the results
that we have generated for our clients
between October to November. And I
actually have specific examples of three
different cases from 5 to 10k a month in
ad spend from 40 to 80k a month in ad
spend and from 100 to 300k a month in ad
spend just to show you guys that this
approach works on different brands uh
whatever the actual spend is. So let me
show you the example here. This brand is
spending 5K a month specifically. And
this month we got a 3.24 return on the
ad spend here. The last 10 days we got a
4x row with a 13k uh spent in around 10
days. Here we're spending around 40 50k
a month. And it is another big brand
that we're spending much more. This is
October. We spent 250 around 250k with a
3.31 return on the ad spend. So, how
does this sequencing creative strategy
actually works? So, this strategy is
based on the newest meta updates gem.
And if you don't know yet, Meta
algorithm now doesn't optimize the
single ads as I also said in many of my
other videos, but optimize the ad
sequence. This is the article. You can
also have a look at the article by
yourself. If you find if you search on
Google Metagam, you will see it and you
will see this specific uh graph here.
where they show you exactly how uh the
delivery system now works. And so
basically after these updates, we
started to test a new setup that seem to
deliver better results uh based on this
sequence modeling and the Wukong system
that GEM uses to deliver ads. So every
batch of ads we create now is a
sequence. So every time we launch a new
set of ads, we follow this uh graph
here. Basically for each persona that we
have we create different angle and then
for each angle we create different ads
of different user awareness stages. So
what we do basically we create at least
one ad for each user awareness stage and
deliver batches of five to 10 ads. So
every time we launch new ads every week
or every two weeks or every month
depending on how much each brand is
spending, we usually launch between five
to 10 ads all together in one adset and
these ads are basically spread across
the user awareness stages. We never
create five to 10 ads only for for
instance for the solution aware or
unaware audience but we make sure that
the ads are actually spread across the
different user awareness stages. And let
me give you a more clear example. Uh and
by the way the goal is to make sure that
each ads connect to each other as a
journey. So basically what this means is
that the angle needs to be consistent
but the message needs to be shaped for
different user awareness stages. So let
me actually give you an example for a
drink supplement brands uh that let's
say improves you uh helps you to improve
uh sleep. Okay. So this is the actual
process. Uh the step number one is pick
your persona. Okay. Now for this brand
specifically, this is just like an
example. It's not like an existing
client that we have for instance, but
just to explain you guys how it works.
So first identify your persona. Avatar
in this case, let's say the tired um
high achiever. Okay, a busy professional
28 to 45, productivity driven, stressed,
hates wasting time on complicated
routines, wants a simple fix uh that
works tonight. Okay. So this is
basically the persona that we have
picked for this brand. Okay. Uh now
after you have picked the persona, you
go to the next step which is the angle.
Now you need to pick an angle for this
persona. There might be different angles
but you need to choose one specifically
that you start testing. So you pick the
angle and in this case let's say the
angle is effortless nightly ritual big
change in sleep. Okay. This is the angle
that we actually want to push. Okay. Now
what we need to do we need to define
different messages and the messages that
we define we need to make sure that
these messages adapt to different user
awareness stages. So here for instance
they created 10 different examples of 10
different messages just to give you
really what it feels like when it comes
to actually creating the ads like you
cannot make any mistakes here guys like
this is so um like so specific. Okay, so
first unaware ads message imagine waking
up actually rested not in a fork concept
aspiring future self user awareness
stage unaware this is an example then
another unaware ads and then you put
another message again for unaware
audience then problem aware message if
you uh if your mind won't shut off at
night is not your fault so people know
they have a problem they don't know the
solution we show them the solution okay
and then problem aware again and then
what do we basically shape different
messages. So as you can see for plumbing
aware here we have two messages we have
two messages for unaware we have two
message for solution aware we have two
message for product aware and we have
two messages for most aware and as you
can see we also use different concepts
that I can best deliver the message.
The thing is that a lot of people make
mistakes now day because basically what
they do they put a product in probably
like a nice background put an headline
and they change only the headline or the
copy in the visual. But the thing is
that if you keep the same background so
the same visual the same concept for a
different message there might be
a mismatch between the message and the
creative and the concept. So what you
need to make sure your designer ideally
but you need to make sure is that there
is a there is a correlation between uh
the ad concept so the visual and the
message okay a lot of brands still put a
product image headline on top the bullet
points of the benefits and then and
that's it okay it doesn't work like that
okay so different concept for different
user awareness stages and you have the
different messages and then what you
need to do you basically need to create
the outs this is the fourth step you
create all the ads, 10 ads in this case
because we have 10 different messages.
Okay? And then what we do, we just
launch the ads. And when we launch the
ads, we have two option here. If your
current adset inside the campaign that
you have is performing bad, you can
simply just launch the ads inside the
existing adset. If the ads is actually
performing well, the adset already
existing adset is actually performing
well, you don't want to touch it. You
don't want to you don't want to restore
the learning of the of the specific
adset. So what you want to do in that
case you want to launch a new adset
inside the existing campaign uh with
these 10 ads inside. Okay is only an
example you can do five you can do 10.
The more you do the best ideally because
you have more uh creatives to actually
test. Uh what we see usually is that the
more creatives that we have usually the
best. Sometimes we even have 20 30 even
50. uh in this case specifically here I
said that we use uh five to 10 ads which
is uh exactly what we're doing right now
because it's actually helping us in
terms of uh batches but then at the end
of the day we might have because we keep
adding creative inside an existing adset
what we might have is basically one
adset with different creative inside and
every time we launch a new batch we have
this batch of ads coming inside the
existing adset and so we have an one
adset with 30 40 50 ads Okay, they
compete to each other but they don't
just compete to each other, they also
create different journey within the
actual adset. Okay, and so this actually
helps to improve their performance.
Okay, and this is exactly what we have
guys seen in this specific case here.
Okay, this is exactly what we're doing
uh now and this is working crazy well
actually after the newest uh update gem
and Andromeda. If you have any question
as usual remember to leave a comment.
I'll do my best to reply to everyone.
Uh, that's it for this video.
