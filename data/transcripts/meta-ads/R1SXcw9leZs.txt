# Category: meta-ads

Over the last 7 years, I managed more
than $20 million in Facebook ad spend,
working with over 5,000 students across
pretty much every type of drop shipping
store that you can think of. And in this
video, I'm going to walk you through the
entire process of creating a Facebook ad
campaign completely from scratch. We're
going to go step by step through every
setting that actually matters, why it
matters, and how to avoid the mistakes
that waste money or kill your results
before you even start. And by the end,
you'll know exactly how to set up your
campaigns, test your creatives, and make
decisions based on real data. the combo
that lets beginners start strong instead
of fighting uphill from day one. Now,
look, if you actually want results with
your Facebook ads, this first step right
here is not optional. Before we even
touch ads, we need to set up [music] the
backend the right way. So, I need you to
log in right now because I'm literally
going to do it with you guys click by
click where all you have to do is just
make sure that you're following along.
All right, so the first thing that we're
going to do is we're going to create the
Facebook page that your ads are going to
run from. So on Facebook, just go to the
left side, scroll down, click pages, and
then hit create new page. Now, this is a
public page. So this is going to be the
one that customers will see. So for the
page name, just go ahead and use your
store name. [music] Now, for the
category, type shopping service or
whatever matches best from what you're
selling. Now, for this bio, do not
overthink it. You can come in here, you
can just write something simple that
explains what your store sells. Or if
you want it to sound cleaner, you can
also have chatbt generate one and just
go ahead and paste it in. So right here,
just go ahead and hit create page. And
then now we got the skeleton of our
business page. Now after that, Facebook
is going to let you add in your website,
your email, your phone number, profile
picture, and a cover photo. Now, just go
ahead and toss something in this for now
as we can always update it later on. All
right, so next thing we need is the
domain because that's what you're going
to end up verifying inside of Meta. So
inside Shopify, I'm clicking through the
builder, hitting get domain, and then
choosing the free option that they gave
us for the first year. I type it in, I
connect it, and that's it. It's pretty
simple. Now, let's go and bounce back to
the Facebook page real quick and go
ahead and finish the setup. So, right
here, go ahead and add the website that
we just grabbed for your temporary.mmy
Shopify domain if it's not already
verified yet. Then, add in a profile
picture, add a cover photo, and then hit
done. Now, after doing all that, your
business page is officially live. Now,
this is the page that all your ads are
going to be shown from. And you'll also
use it for organic engagement, liking,
posting your niche, commenting,
following creators in your space, all of
that. And I will explain why this is so
important later in this video, but for
now, we just needed the page created.
Next up, we're going to build your
business portfolio. This is Meta's
version of your business manager. So,
I'm heading back into the ads manager,
and then at the top, you're going to see
the option that says create a business
portfolio. So, go ahead and click that
and then type in your portfolio name.
Now, it's going to go ahead and ask you
for your name. And here, you want to go
ahead and put your real first and your
real last name exactly how it's shown on
your ID because there might be a couple
times where they ask you to verify that
later on. And it does have to match for
you to be able to make it through that
security. So, now you have that set up,
just go ahead and hit confirm. And then
right here, you're going to see the
Facebook page that we just created pop
up. So, just go ahead and select it.
Click next. And now your business
portfolio is officially created. All
right. All right. Now, the next step
from here is we need to create an ad
account. [music] So, right here on the
left side, go ahead and click settings,
then ad accounts, then create new ad
account. Then, for the name, I mean, you
can just go ahead and type in your store
name again as nobody's actually going to
see this. Now, you also want to make
sure that your time zone is correct. So,
I'm going to go ahead and choose central
because I'm locally here in Dallas. Now,
right here, you just want to go ahead
and set the currency to USD or whatever
currency you're in. Hit next, agree to
the terms, and then create the account.
Now, Facebook is now going to ask you to
add a payment method. Now, you have the
choice to do this now or do it later,
but you have to add it before you start
running ads. So, honestly, I suggest
getting it over with right here. So,
everything is ready to go once [music]
we do actually start running the ads.
All right. So, now that we have all of
that finished, let's go ahead and set up
the pixel. So, on the left menu, go
ahead and scroll to data sources, click
pixels, and then hit create pixel. Then,
just name it something simple. I'm just
going to go ahead and name it pixel 1.
Now that you have that finished, we're
then going to go ahead and assign it to
your business portfolio and then hit
create. Now, we need to connect this
pixel to Shopify so we can actually
track your visitors. So, I'm going to go
and click into the events manager,
select that same exact pixel, scroll
down to partner integrations, and then
hit Shopify. So, now go ahead and click
connect account, continue with your
Facebook login, choose your business
portfolio, and then when it asks for
permission level, always always choose
maximum so it can track all the data
that it needs. Shopify is now going to
show you a list of pixels. So, what you
want to do is just make sure that you
match the last four digits of the Pixel
ID to make sure that you are choosing
the right one. Then once that's done, go
and click connect, agree to the terms,
and then [music] submit for review.
You're then going to see it process for
just a little bit, and then you're going
to be good. So, now the pixel is
connected, but it is not active yet. So,
we do need to go ahead and get it set
up. So, let's head back in here into
Shopify. Go to online store,
preferences, and then password. Then, we
want to go and remove the password so
the store is publicly viewable. Then
you're going to want to go ahead and
grab your store domain. Now, if your
custom domain isn't ready yet, just go
ahead and use a temporary Shopify domain
and where you can go ahead and find it
right here under settings and then
domains. Now, go ahead and copy that URL
and then paste it into the Facebook
pixel test field. Now, this next step is
important. You want to go ahead and open
up the store and act like a customer.
So, click around, open up a product, add
it [music] to cart, click buy now, and
even start the checkout. Now, you're not
going to actually buy here. What you're
doing is you're just firing the pixel
event [music] so that Meta sees
activity. Then after doing all that
activity, you want to go back into the
events manager and after a few seconds
your pixel should go from red to green.
Now if it doesn't, you do want to go
back into the store. Go ahead and click
around again as this is [music] also
totally normal. Then once again, once it
does turn green, go ahead and hit next
and then finish. And before we move on,
let me add something here because this
is the exact moment where I wish someone
had stopped me years ago. Back when one
of my first products took off, my Pixel
was active. My backend was set up. I
mean, everything looked perfect, but I
still wasn't ready. Orders started
rolling in and my supplier completely
collapsed under the pressure. I had
delays, missing packages, I mean, angry
customers, and chargebacks everywhere.
So, yes, I did look profitable on paper,
but I didn't see a single dollar of it.
And it wasn't because my ads were bad.
It was because my fulfillment wasn't
ready for the momentum that I created.
That's why I tell beginners to lock in
with Team Drop right here [music] before
traffic ever hits your store. because
they act like an actual partner, not
just a random supplier where you get
real communication, real support,
verification photos before every order
goes out. Everything that I wish I had
before things blew up on me. So, no, you
don't need it later when things break.
You actually need it right now when
everything is still clean so that you're
prepared when the ads start moving. So,
now at this point, your Facebook page,
your domain, your business portfolio,
your ad account, pixel, and supplier are
now all set up correctly. And that's
your entire backend cleaned, synced, and
now ready to run real ads with. But now
that the backend is set up, [music] you
are officially ready for the step that
most beginners skip, which is warming up
the account. And look, you can skip this
part if you want. Nobody stopping you.
But here's the truth. Almost every time
that a beginner skips this part, they
will end up paying for it later on. A
brand new ad account with no activity,
no engagement, and no pixel data, Meta
sees that as a risk. And when Meta
thinks that you're a risk, your ads will
not deliver the way that they should,
which makes them way more expensive,
they barely even get reached to anyone,
and the whole campaign fights against
you from day one. And you want to know
the solution? Well, this is this warm-up
campaign because it prevents all of
that. And it literally only takes 2
minutes to set up. Let me go and show
you how to get it done. All right, so
inside the ads manager, what you want to
do first is go ahead and hit create,
click on engagement, and then manual
engagement campaign. [music] Now, you
want to make sure that the objective
says engagement, and then keep
everything else at the campaign level
simple. Inside the adset, you want to
name it something like warm-up, and then
set the location to the tier one
countries, age 21 plus, and your budget
at $10 per day. Now, for the engagement
type, go ahead and choose Facebook page.
And since this is just warming things
up, you don't need a perfect midnight
launch. So, whatever point of the day
that it is, just go ahead and launch it
at that time because engagement
campaigns, they don't require that level
of precision, which you will see why
once we start actually running our ads.
But for now, let's go ahead and stick to
warming up our account. Now, inside the
ad itself, go ahead and upload one
simple scroll stopping image, something
positive and eye-catching. Then, pair
that with a short, welcoming captions,
like two lines max, something that makes
your page feel real, [music] and then
puts good energy behind your brand.
Scrolling down, just make sure that your
pixel is active and showing green under
tracking. And then go ahead and hit
publish. Met is now going to ask you to
add a payment method if you haven't
already added one yet. So, this is going
to be the perfect place to go ahead and
do that. And that's it. I mean, $10 a
day. You just let this thing run and
it's going to start getting your account
warmed up. So, you're going to be in the
best position to start running ads here
in a second. And I do want to be real
why this matters even more in [music]
2026. Meta is stricter than it's ever
been before. Brand new ad accounts are
getting flagged, slowed down, and pushed
to the back of the line before they ever
even get a chance to perform. Most
beginners never recover from that, and
they're already fighting uphill before
the ads even turn on. But you're not in
that position anymore. You've already
given Meta the early activity that it
wants to see. Your page looks alive.
Your pixel has movement and your account
is treated like it's actually here to do
business, not like some empty profile
trying to sell overnight. So now you're
starting from a place that most people
never reach. And because of that, you're
finally ready for the part that actually
determines whether you lose money or
make money, which is testing your ads.
All right, so here's where things get
interesting. Because the next step isn't
guessing or throwing random ads at the
wall. It's finding what's already
working before you ever even spend a
single dollar. And once you know where
to look, the pattern jumps out fast. So
the question is, well, where's the first
place that I should go? And the answer
is Tik Tok. So once you make it on Tik
Tok right here, just go ahead and search
your product name. And what you're
looking for is user generated style or
UGC videos with engagement that have
solid views, comments, and likes. So I
just went ahead and typed weight loss
patches into Tik Tok. And look at this.
Here's a video with a little over 20,000
likes. Not views, likes. Which tells me
right away that people are not just
watching this. They are agreeing with
it, saving it, tagging friends, and that
is real demand and engagement. And when
you watch it, it's the exact type of
content that we want. A clear
demonstration of the product, no
watermark, no brand logo baked in, and
no heavy editing. And you can tell that
this isn't some polished brand ad. This
is raw UGC. It's straight to the point,
and that's why it connects, and the
comments confirm it. People are asking
[music] questions. They're sharing their
experiences, debating whether it works.
I mean all the stuff that you want to
see. That's what makes a creative like
this valuable. When a simple low lift
video is pulling real engagement like
this, it means the solution and the
messaging behind the creative is doing
the heavy lifting, not fancy editing and
not a crazy [music] script. And that's
exactly the type of creatives that you
want to test. Because if it's already
working organically, it has a real shot
at performing inside [music] paid ads.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go ahead and copy this link. I'm going
to go ahead and drop it into the SSS
tick or snap tick and download it
without the Tik Tok watermark. And just
like that, I've got a cleanbased
creative that is now ready to test. Now,
another tool that I love to find
creatives [music] is also by utilizing
the meta ad library where you're kind of
doing the same thing. You're just
searching for your product or niche. And
then inside, you're going to see every
ad competitor that is running on
Facebook and Instagram. So, you'll see
their videos, their images, their
headlines, their offers. I mean, all of
it. I mean, here's one example right
here where you can see the angle that
they're pushing, which is heat [music]
up in 3 seconds paired with a clean UGC
clip. And if you're seeing multiple
brands across a niche using that same
angle, well, that's a sign that it's
definitely pulling conversions. And if
you want to go ahead and download a
competitor video from here, just use a
browser extension like Video Downloader
Plus. Then just save it, download it,
and you're done. Now, I do want to be
clear that we are not copying their text
word for word. Instead, you want to take
their best performing angle, paste it in
chatbt, and then say something like,
"This is my competitor's primary text
for their [music] meta ad. Make me my
own high converting version of this for
my sales campaign." Then just ask for
like two or three variations. One from
the problem angle, one from the
convenience angle, and one from the
emotional benefit. Boom. Now, in only a
couple seconds, you got multiple
versions that are now ready to test. And
at this point, I do want around five
creatives [music] total. And you kind of
want to do this mix of videos and images
because you just never can assume. You
really have to let the data tell you
which one is going to perform the best.
So once I have my videos, my images, and
my different marketing angles, I'm now
officially ready to set up the creative
testing campaign. This is how you figure
out which ad is actually going to stop
the scroll, which angle people respond
to, and which one has the potential to
carry your [music] entire store. And in
2026, this step is even more important
because Meta's new Andromeda update that
changed everything. and Jamba to put way
more weight onto creative performance
than it ever has before. It
automatically pushes your budget towards
the ad that's [music] getting the
strongest reactions. So, when you're
testing your creatives the right way,
you're letting the algorithm do the
heavy lifting [music] for you. And
that's why this works so well now. Then,
once you find that winning creative,
every campaign after this just becomes
so much easier, cheaper, and way more
predictable. So, let me show you exactly
how to set this thing up the right way.
So, back when you make it to this main
dashboard, just go ahead and hit create
and then hit sales. Now, what you want
to do is turn on CBO so Medic can put
your budget wherever the strongest
creative is. And right here, what we're
going to do is go ahead and name the
campaign. I'm going to go ahead and type
in something like weight loss patches
sales campaign. Then for budget, I would
recommend starting at around $50 a day.
And sure, yes, you can do 20 or $25, but
I want you to understand lower budget
equals slower data. Where at $50, you
know exactly what works within a day or
two. Now, once the budget is set inside
the adset, you want to set the
conversion location to website. [music]
since we are going to be sending people
to your Shopify product page, not your
homepage, your product page. So, I do
want to make that very clear. Now, for
the performance goal, it should always
be maximize number of conversions and
the event should always be purchase.
Next, we're going to go ahead and set
the schedule to start at midnight. Now,
this is important because if you turn
your ads on at 3 p.m., Meta will try to
spend that full daily budget in only a
couple hours, which ultimately hurts
your performance, [music] where midnight
gives you clean delivery and clean data.
Now, for targeting, you want to make
this as simple as possible, which is by
keeping it broad. Now that that's set,
go and set your location to the main
buying countries. The ones that
consistently perform the best are going
to be United States, Canada, the UK,
Australia, and New Zealand. Now, for
age, go ahead and make it 21 plus, and
then set the language set at English.
Again, the whole point here is that this
is a creative test, so we definitely
don't want to over complicate targeting.
And here's the thing. When you do reach
this stage, your biggest risk isn't
losing money on ads. It's running your
ads without any protection. Because when
real orders start coming in, well, so do
refunds, disputes, and chargebacks that
you never saw coming. That's why before
running any serious spin test, I always
always make sure that my backend is
completely bulletproof. And one tool
that helped me keep it that way, the one
that I recommended to all my students
are complete beginners to drop shipping
and running ads is chargeback.io. Now,
this is a tool that is quietly running
in the background, filtering out fraud
and preventing chargebacks before they
ever even hit your processor, keeping
your dispute rate low and your account
as healthy as possible because nothing
is going to kill momentum faster than
getting flagged just when your store is
finally ready to start taking off. So,
if you want to start with the same
protection that I give all my beginners,
go ahead and grab it in the description
below. Now, let's go and jump back to
setting up the rest of this campaign.
All right, so inside the ad level, you
want to make sure that your Facebook
page and your Instagram account are
connected. Then you want to go ahead and
paste your exact product page URL inside
of the website URL field. Again, [music]
not the homepage because the fewer
clicks that it takes to land on your
product, the higher the conversions are
going to be. Now, right here is where
you're going to go ahead and upload all
of your creatives. Now, let's go ahead
and lock in the text. Now, this is the
part that either pulls people in or
loses them immediately, where your
primary text is where you're going to
sell the product, the benefits, the
problem that it solves, and why it's
even worth clicking. But the structure
is what actually makes people read it.
So, you want to space it out. Short
lines, clear points, no walls of text
because people will scroll right past
those. And the very first line, that is
everything. I mean, it's about 90% of
your success. If that first line doesn't
make someone stop, nothing else matters.
And if someone taps the see more button,
that's a clear signal telling Meta that
people care about this. And Meta rewards
that by pushing your ad to more people
for cheaper. Now, with your headline,
this should always highlight your main
offer, like 50% off plus free shipping,
buy two, get one free, or buy one and
get the second one for 50% off. You want
to always avoid bland headlines like
hair growth spray, shop now. Nobody's
going to click on those because they
don't communicate value. They don't tell
the customer what they're getting or why
they should care. But after you get all
of that inputed, you now have your first
ad completed. And look, instead of
rebuilding everything from scratch, all
we now have to do is just duplicate your
first ad. So if you have five creatives,
you want five ads inside that same
adset. And when duplicating, you always
want to double check the basics, which
is going to be your URL, your shop now,
call to action, pixel, copy, and your
correct creative selected. When you're
duplicating, Meta sometimes does reset
small things. So always just go in and
confirm it. And now once all your
creatives have their own individual ad,
we are now ready to publish. All right,
so at this point, your creative testing
campaign is officially built. You've got
multiple angles, multiple creatives,
clean tracking, clean text, and clean
structure. Everything's set up exactly
the way that it should be. But I want
you to remember, the whole reason that
we set this up the way we did is so that
the next step actually means something.
Because once the ads start spinning, the
entire game shifts. Now you're not
building anymore. You're [music]
reading. You're letting the numbers tell
you which angle's strong, which one is
weak, and which one actually has the
potential to carry your entire store.
[music] And if you don't know how to
read that data, everything that you just
did becomes guesswork. So, in this next
section, I'm going to break down how to
understand your numbers the right way.
Your CPM, CTR, unique link clicks, add
[music] to cardarts, purchases, rorowaz,
all of it. Because the faster that you
can read your data, [music] the faster
that you can cut the losers, pushy
winners, and scale with confidence.
Look, before we get into any of this,
let me just address the obvious. Seeing
all these numbers for the first time, it
can 100% feel overwhelming. Everybody
feels that way. But what I'm going to do
is I'm going to make this as simple as
possible. [music] So, by the time that
we are done with this section, you're
going to know exactly what every metric
means, why it matters, and how to use it
to make the right call, [music] where
you can turn an ad off, keep it running,
or scale it with confidence. Because
once you understand this part, running
ads stops being guesswork. every
decision becomes clear, fast, and
profitable. So, let me go and pull up
this KPI sheet because once you learn
how to read it the right way, everything
else in your ad account finally starts
to make sense. So, the first number that
you're going to see is CPM, or better
known as cost per,000 impressions. What
this is going to do is it's going to
tell you how expensive your niche or
audience is with what you're putting out
there to them. So, there's only two
things that can happen here. You can
have a low CPM or a high CPM. A lower
CPM means cheaper traffic. Higher CPM
means even more expensive traffic. And
if CPMs are super high, everything else
will naturally be more expensive. So, if
it's around like that $15 to $20 range,
you're definitely doing good. But if you
notice it around $30 to $40 plus, that's
just telling you that your industry is
more competitive and your ads are not
competitive enough inside [music] of
that industry. Now, next is going to be
your CPC or better known as your cost
per click. This just basically tells you
how much you're paying for someone to
click your ad. So, the lower the better.
But again, CPC alone is not going to sit
here and tell you the full story. Now,
this is going to lead us into one of the
leading decision metrics that matters a
lot in creative testing, which is going
to be your cost per unique link click.
This is what the real cost is for you to
get somebody to visit your website.
Look, Facebook counts every click, even
if the same person taps into your ad
five times. So, unique link clicks are
only going to be counting for the people
who make it to your website, while your
clicks are only going to count for the
people who are clicking into your ad,
which makes this number far more
important than your cost per clicks.
This is why the KPI sheet gives you a
cut off for your unique link click cost.
Now, for example, if your cutoff is $110
for your cost per link click, and this
ad that you're looking at has spent like
$5 to $10 and you don't have a single
link click into your website, just go
ahead and turn it off. You don't even
have to run all the way to the break
even cost per purchase, which we will
talk about in a little bit, because you
know that your ad is already showing you
early on that it's not working. Now,
let's go ahead and jump into the next
big metric that's important, which is
going to be your CTR, or better known as
your clickthrough rate. Now, your click
rate is going to tell you one thing. Did
your creatives actually make people stop
and [music] click to watch them? Now,
what I like to look for here is 2 and
12% and up. That's the baseline that
tells me that the thumbnail, the
headline, and the ad copy text is doing
well enough to get people to want to
click into it. Now, the next metric that
you always want to be aware of is going
to be your average video watch time,
which is just going to tell you on
average how long people are watching
your videos. And the more that they're
watching, obviously, it's going to come
down to the more that they're interested
in the product. Now, that is all
considered [music]
front-end metrics. Now, why I call this
front-end metrics is because this is all
things that happen before they actually
click into your website. Now, we are
going to head into your back-end
metrics, which is what it's going to
cost for people to make actions when
they do visit [music] your website.
Starting off with add to cart. Now,
these metrics are going to be your holy
grail. These are the most important
metrics when it comes to your creative
testing campaign. This is the moment
that tells you that your ad did its job.
You know the right audience and you know
the right person that you're targeting.
And when they did make it to your
website, you know exactly how much it
costs for them to add the product to
cart. So add to carts are a big deal in
testing because they're the first sign
that people are seriously considering
buying. And this is why that cutoff
number exists because even if you're
driving traffic to your website, but
they're not sitting there adding the
product to the cart, you also don't want
to spend way too much money on that
either. So it kind of gives you that
parameter that you can use to make the
right type of decision-m when running
ads. For example, if you have a cutoff
now with $10 for an add to cart and you
get an add toart at $8 and that break
even purchase number tells you exactly
how far you can let an ad spend while
still giving it a chance to break even
and get a purchase, which means that
ultimately you're not losing money, but
you're also not making money either. So,
in our example, let's say your break
even cost per purchase is $23.78.
Then if you do get an add to cart by
that $10 break even add to cart, then we
will now let it run to $23.78
to try to get that purchase. And if it
hits that number and you don't get a
purchase, you turn it off. But if you do
before you reach it to that point, you
then know that you made profit. And
also, you can notice that it doesn't
just stop after the first purchase, it
continues to keep going from that point
as well. So then you know that your next
break even is going to be $47.56,
which means that if you don't get that
second purchase by that point, you still
then just turn it off. Then you see your
fourth point is $118.90
and so on and so forth. This is where
everything becomes mathbased. Once
purchases come in, you move through the
break even ladder where each step along
the way tells you exactly how far to let
the ad spend go before deciding if it
stays or gets cut. And then when you're
seeing these purchases consistently
coming in under those thresholds, which
you will because you're following the
strategy, well, that's when you know
you're ready to scale. Now, right here
on the right hand side of the KPI sheet,
you're going to see your break even
rorowaz and your target cost per
purchase. Now, your break even rorowaz
or better known as your return on ad
spin is just telling you something
similar to [music] any type of business,
which is ROI. Are you making money while
running ads or are you losing money
while running ads? So, if your break
even rorowaz is 1.69 and your actual
rorowaz is above that, then you're
profitable. And anything below that
means that you're not. Same exact thing
applies when it comes to the target cost
[music] per purchase. If you're below it
consistently, you are 100% in a great
place. So, here's a simple way to think
about all of this. Clickthrough rate
just tells you if your ad and your
thumbnails are interesting. Your unique
link clicks tell you if people care
enough to click into your website. Your
added cards tell you if the offer makes
sense. Your purchase tells you if your
funnel works. And your rorowaz tells you
if you made money. And I know 10 minutes
ago this all looked crazy confusing. But
now you can read your data like someone
who's been running ads for months. you
know what's good, what's bad, when to
turn things off, when to keep them
running, and when it's time to scale.
And most importantly, you're no longer
guessing. I mean, the numbers tell you
everything. And because you made it this
far, I'm actually going to give you this
exact KPI playbook that people spend
thousands on for 100% free. So, when it
is time to run your ads, you have a
clear road map for what to cut, what to
keep running, and what to scale. And you
can click the link in the description
right below to grab it so you can
finally start understanding your own
numbers. Okay, so now that the testing
phase is handled and you understand what
it means to read your data, let me go
ahead and walk you through what comes
next, which is what to do when you
finally see a winning creative inside
your ads manager. All right, so we ended
up publishing seven different ads, and
we actually ended up getting a few
purchases from one of them here. So,
let's go ahead and dive a little bit
deeper into the metrics. So, as you can
see on ad three, we ended up getting two
purchases with a cost per result right
around $10.24.
So, there were a couple ads that were
turned off because the spin was getting
a little too high and we weren't really
seeing that 2 and a half% clickthrough
rate that we [music] wanted. Now, these
ads weren't performing the way that we
needed. So, ultimately what we needed to
do was just go ahead and cut them. And
the ones that were left on were the
stronger performers where you can see
right here with ad 7. I mean, it has a
lot of engagement and a lot of clicks.
But, we are seeing more ad cards coming
specifically from ad 3. And that's when
you got to start making those decisions.
You can see ad 7 does look good on the
front-end metrics, but ad three is the
one that's actually pushing people
deeper into the funnel. That's why we
always look at both reach, clicks, click
rate on one side, which again is your
front end, and then your ad to cards,
checkouts, and purchases on the other,
which is your [music] back end before we
ever decide which ad to move forward
with. Now, overall, looks like ad 3 is a
winning creative here with $42.20 spent.
We had two purchases coming in from ad 3
plus a couple of upsells attached to
those orders. Now, ROAZ is positive at
3.28, which is solid. And if we go
briefly back here to the KPI calculator,
you can see that our target profit
rorowaz KPI is 1.74. And that was to
make a 20% profit margin. So 1.74 is the
goal. And we now have done 3.28 rorowaz,
which means that we're sitting right
around like a 40% profit margin with
this. Now, looking back on our metrics,
at this point, we know that ad 3 is the
winning ad. Now, we're already getting a
good return on our ad spend. So, if we
just go ahead and increase a budget, we
can expect cost per click to stay around
that a dollar range, but ultimately make
even more sales and profit. So, let's go
ahead and click on add three, hit
duplicate, and then choose to duplicate
the original setup into a new campaign.
Now, we can go ahead and finish setting
this new campaign out. So, here, what
we're going to do is just simply
increase the budget. Somewhere around
that $75 to $100 is definitely a good
start, depending on how many ads that
you're running. Now, the more that you
increase the budget, the more people
that you can touch with it, and
ultimately the more chances that you
give yourself to make even more money.
This is exactly why we did the creative
testing campaign first to make sure that
we had good metrics and actual
conversions before putting more money
behind anything. So, with the rest of
this campaign, I mean, honestly, we're
just going to keep everything else
relatively the same. The campaign name
reflects that this is the winning setup.
The adset is still sending traffic to
the same website, and our performance
goal is still maximize number of
conversions. And then for the purchase
event, we're still going to always
optimize for purchase with Pixel 1. So,
we're going to go ahead and have this
scheduled again for midnight so that the
budget spins cleanly over the next full
day. And then on the audience side,
again, we're still going to keep things
the exact same as before. Now, when it
comes to targeting, you have two
decisions here. You can either keep one
broad adset targeting a group of top
countries, or you can start structuring
things by duplicating the adset and
focusing on one country per adset. For
example, you can stick with the United
States in one asset and then add
additional adsets for other strong
markets that you already seen activity
from. Now, in this case, when we broke
down the campaign data, we saw a lot of
engagement coming from Canada and we
even had a few purchases from Canada as
well. We also saw activity from places
like Portugal and the United Kingdom.
So, one option is keep the original
adset targeting the United States and
then duplicate that asset and then swap
the country to Canada, then duplicate
that again and swap it to United Kingdom
and then just so on and so forth where
you're still utilizing that same winning
ad and focusing on the same structure.
You're just giving it more chances
across different countries where you
know that there's interest, where you're
letting the advantage plus in the AI
system help you build a stronger overall
campaign score as you scale. Now, back
at the ad level, we're going to keep
working with the same winning ad, which
is ad three. We already know that the
base creative works. So instead of
changing the whole video right away,
we're going to create variety by just
testing different types of thumbnails.
So we're going to take that winning ad
three and then now duplicate it multiple
times. In this case, we're going to
duplicate it four times. So we have a
total of five different ads. All these
different ads are using the same winning
video, but again, each one will just
have a different thumbnail where you'll
see something like add three thumbnail
one as original and then add three
thumbnail two, add three thumbnail
three, and then just so on and so forth.
So, you just want to go and click into
one of these duplicates, scroll down to
the media section, and then hit edit
media. Choose edit video, and then click
on the thumbnail. Now, here you're going
to see different frames from the video
itself that you can then use as
alternate thumbnails. So, for thumbnail
3, for example, we're going to select
one of these images, save [music] it,
and now that still image will show
before the video plays, giving us a
slightly different hook on that same
type of winning ad. Then we just want to
repeat this for the rest of the
duplicates. So we end up with multiple
versions of ad three, each with
different thumbnails. That way we're
still pushing our best performing video,
but with more variety and how it appears
in the feed. And doing things like this
is why understanding your data before
this point is so important. Because once
you get into this step of scaling, every
decision has bigger consequences. And
your numbers are the only thing that
keeps you profitable. All right. Now, if
you're still here, then you just got the
full blueprint that most beginners never
see. You now know how to set everything
up the right way. You know how to test
your creatives the right way. You know
how to read your numbers without
guessing. And that alone is going to put
you light years ahead of everyone else
that's still spinning their wheels. But
let's be real for a second. Even with
all of this, some of you are still going
to be stuck on the most important step,
finding the winning product that you can
run through the system. And if you don't
start with something that already has
demand behind it, everything becomes 10
times harder. the creatives, the
engagement, the testing, the data, all
of it becomes extremely difficult. So
before you launch anything, you need
products that are backed by real proof.
That's why I just dropped a video where
I break down and give you the top 10
winning and trending products for this
month, products that are already showing
momentum, already pulling engagement and
already backed by real data. So, if you
want an easier start, if you want
creatives that practically build
themselves, then you want to go ahead
and watch that video next and go ahead
and let the algorithm do the heavy
lifting from day one. So, I'll see you
there at this next video. As always,
thank you guys so much for watching. I
appreciate every single one of you guys
rocking out with me. This is AC with
