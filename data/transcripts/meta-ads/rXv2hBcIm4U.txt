the best way to advertise to actually
get results with Facebook ads in 2025 is
so different from what it used to be.
And I can tell you this because so far
this year, I've been managing hundreds
of thousands in ad spend for a bunch of
different e-commerce businesses all over
the world, but also for local service
businesses. And in fact, back in
December of 2024, Meta's own engineering
team stated that their own algorithm
will work totally differently. And this
new update to the algorithm has now been
rolled out. And this is the reason why
so many advertisers are struggling
today. Now, in the next few minutes, I'm
going to break down what this update
actually means for your business and how
you can take advantage of the new
algorithm to actually get results in
2025 going into 2026. And I'm not just
going to show this based on theory. I'm
actually going to go into my ads
accounts for some of my clients and show
you exactly what we are doing today to
get amazing profitable results that are
also scalable. Now, quickly before we
get into this video, why should you
listen to me? Okay, so I live and breed
meta ads on a day-to-day basis, working
with multiple different clients all over
the world, both in ecom and local
service. and I also consult and advice
for multiple different businesses direct
talking to founders knowing exactly what
they're struggling with and having a
deep look into their own data. So I have
a lot of understanding of what's going
on right now in the market. I've also
been in the advertising space for the
last 6 years managing millions in ad
spend just on meta alone but also on
Google ads and other platforms and I've
worked directly with different
businesses understanding not only how
these advertising platforms work but how
we can align the strategy that we use on
these platforms with all of these
different businesses and what their
ultimate goals are. So, I spent hours
digging into this new article from
Meta's own engineering team really to
understand what is actually different
about the algorithm and how can I use it
to my advantage. So, without you having
to go in and read it, I'm just going to
give you the conclusion for what's
actually relevant to you as an
advertiser. So, as you can see, the
article is pretty advanced. I mean, it's
not really tailored to everyday
advertiser to understand this and
there's a lot in this article itself
that is not really relevant for us. So,
let's skip all that and get straight to
the conclusion that I've made. So this
is Meta's Andromeda which basically is
their machine learning system. So with
the new way the machine learning system
works, it's essentially able to tackle a
lot bigger data sets of creatives and
it's much better at matching creatives
and ads with the users on Facebook and
Instagram. So over the last few years,
advertisers are applying way more
creative elements into their campaigns,
okay? More images, videos, different
types of adsets, right? Different
headlines, different ad copies. And for
the algorithm to really understand how
to match these creative elements with
users on Meta, it needed an upgrade so
that the machine learning can actually
be able to digest all of these different
creatives and match them with the users
on Facebook and Instagram. Now, as this
update was rolled out, a lot of things
have happened in the advertising space,
and I'm sure you've heard that the new
way to win with meta ads is creative
diversity, right? And a lot of people
don't really tell you why you need so
many creatives and why also the new way
of targeting is through the creative
itself. And this article right here
explains exactly the reason why that is.
Now, historically, there's been a lot of
obsession about finding a winning ad.
So, when we've been doing the testing in
the past, our whole strategy, and I'm
going to be honest, even for my own
agency and the way we work with clients
has been trying to iterate that one
winning ad, that is the one that's going
to take the whole ad account to a new
level, right? It's going to allow us to
scale profitably and get a lot of new
customers into our business. But with
the new algorithm, that is no longer the
approach you should take. And we are not
using that approach anymore either. And
when we went away from that approach,
we've seen way better results with this
new strategy that we applying now. So
instead of obsessing about finding that
one winning ad and just creating
iterations of the same best performer in
the ad account, maybe you have one video
in your ad account that you see is
working pretty well and you want to just
create another hook, maybe shorten the
length, add another call to action, and
just making these small tweaks. We're
not doing that to the same extent
anymore. What we're doing instead is
we're optimizing for massive creative
diversity. And that sounds like a fancy
word, but what that actually means when
we are testing different concepts, okay,
a new type of video, a new type of
static image, we want that ad to be so
different from the audio ads that it can
tap into a totally different part of the
audience. And it can then allow us to
get results from a whole different
persona within our audience. So, let me
show you a very clear example of what
this actually looks like in an ad
account. So, I'm now inside one of my
clients ad accounts and this is by far
the ad that gets the most amount of
spend and it's also driving the most
amount of conversions. Now when we look
at the breakdown of the ad itself, we
can see that most of the results are
coming from 55, 64, and 65 plus. So a
pretty old demographic and that makes
total sense because the angle of this ad
is targeting people with poor eyesight.
This product that's being sold here is
also able to solve this specific issue.
But of course, it makes sense that the
older demographic will uh resonate more
with this angle, right? Where we're
actually pinpointing this poor eyesight
problem. But if we want to tap into a
wider demographic, then we need
different creative. So, I'll also show
you another ad that we're running here.
And this is the second best performing
ad in their account. And when you look
at the demographics area, you can also
see that we're tapping into also a much
younger part of the audience. The
creative here is allowing us to tap into
a wider range of segments within that
broad audience that we're targeting. And
this is essentially why it's now so
important to really understand how you
can use your creative to these different
segments. So, as you can see, the key
thing here is you need to use creative
to tap into the different parts of your
audience with the different unique
problems um that they have, right? So,
in our example, poor eyesight angle is
working really well for the older
demographic. And then we have a totally
different angle for the other ad that I
showed you, which is the second best
performer in the account. Uh and that
one is way more just focusing on the
benefits of the product, not necessarily
the specific pain point of poor
eyesight. So, this is a clear example of
exactly how to do this and why it is so
important because it allows you to go
broad, right? Like broad targeting, but
within that broad targeting, you're able
to capitalize on these different
segments that are relevant for the offer
that you have. Now, I can't show you the
specific ads for the brands that we're
managing, but I can show you some other
brands uh just to bring this point home.
So, let's look at some ads from this
brand right here, True Classic. They're
doing this really, really well. And when
you look at all of their active ads, you
can see that they're tapping into this
specific strategy. They have a lot of
creative diversity. So, let's break it
down. So, as you can see, this ad here,
right, it's a video ad. And as you can
see, the hook here is my husband, 38,
keeps dressing like he's in college. So,
here's what I did. Okay, so first and
foremost, the hook here is obviously
going towards uh women that actually has
a husband. So, older demographic, and
again, women specifically because that
is the people that would resonate with
this text section on the hook. And then
the video goes through and then it shows
the product, right? And then they go
ahead and show the benefit of t-shirt.
Now, this brand is selling t-shirts,
right? Like that's a product that, you
know, it's amazing that they're doing so
well cuz there is so many t-shirts out
there, but they're really leaning. Their
whole business model is their
performance marketing and they're doing
a great job of this. You go show the
product, go to the website, right? Super
UGC style video. And this one is tapping
into women, probably 30, 40 plus. Okay.
Now, we have a static image here that's
targeting a totally different part of
their audience. This one is tapping into
a whole different segment of the
audience. It's super different from the
video that we just looked at. Then you
have another ad right here, right? Which
is actually targeting males themselves,
right? The number one shirt for bigger
boys. Okay, so this one isn't
necessarily targeting fit people. This
is more for the average like a little
bit unfit, don't feel super confident in
most t-shirts, but this t-shirt is kind
of like making them look better. And
then we have another ad. And in the
first frame here, you can see the number
one shirt for guys who lift. So again,
this is a totally different part of the
audience. This is for the guys that
actually lift. So they're tapping into
that segment of their audience as well.
Makes you look fitter than you are. Like
really focusing on fitness and hiding
their gut. So again, you can see that
this brand is really being able to tap
into all of these different segments
within their audience. So you have
another ad, my man wears this t-shirt.
So this is more for girls with
boyfriends that maybe want to buy a gift
for a boyfriend or something like that.
Ad right here is then tapping into the
younger female demographic. So an exact
example right here of how you can do
this. Here we have another ad again.
First frame is showing me silently
thanking my algorithm for flooding my
husband's feed with true classic again.
So this one is targeting probably a
little bit older women who has husbands.
So with the new algorithm, creative
diversity is absolutely key to have good
performance and being able to convert at
the high level all of these different
segments of your audience. But one key
thing here is creative diversity alone
is not enough. Just pouring in a bunch
of different ads that are tapping into
different parts of the audience isn't
enough. Most of the ads, even when
you're targeting different segments of
the audience, are probably not going to
be performing well enough. So you still
need to test and iterate to find winners
within this creative diversity. So it's
not as easy as just uploading a bunch of
ads. Okay, I wish it was that easy, but
it's not. So let's look at the exact
campaign structure you need to properly
test and scale winners when you find
them. So this is the exact top ofunnel
evergreen structure that we use. Uh
evergreen just means that these are the
campaigns that continue to run and run.
It's not like promotional focused with a
time limit on them. For that we have
another promo structure which I'm not
going to get into in this video. Now I
just want to focus on that campaign that
you continue to run and test and iterate
on. Okay. So the structure you should
use is two campaigns. Number one, a
scaling campaign. And then you want to
have a testing campaign. So the yellow
one is the testing. The green one here
is the scaling. And the budget split for
your total account between these two
campaigns. Uh I like to keep between 60
to 80% sometimes even 90% on the
scaling. And then for testing, you
should allocate between 20 to 40% just
for testing. kind of depends on your
business and the budget level you're at
and how well your scaling ads are
performing. If you're doing really well
with a couple of ads, I think you should
definitely put a higher amount of budget
into the scaling campaign um just to
keep that consistent flow of results
coming in. But you should always have uh
at least 20% budget allocated to testing
if you want to improve performance and
you know find new winners. So let's
start by looking at the testing
campaign. So you want to use a CBO here.
Okay, so you want to set the budget on
the campaign level. The budget type is
of course daily and bid strategy here
should be highest volume. So at least
every week you should launch a new ad
set uh which I call a batch of ads
because this batch should have a new
concept of ads right that you're testing
out. The setup should be just raw
targeting and you can potentially
exclude existing customers if you have a
lot of existing customers and you want
to really focus this on top of funnel
only which I would recommend especially
when doing testing because when you
launch new adsets meta will try to
target you know lowest hanging fruit
first and if you have a bunch of
existing customers we want to make sure
that we're not inflating our results
with them so we can exclude them from
the targeting but other than that just
go with broad targeting and then every
week launch a new batch. what our sweet
spot is four to six ads, but you can go
beyond this. If you really have the
capacity internally to be able to
produce a higher amount of ads, quality
ads as well, then of course do more than
this. Um, there is brands that are
doing, you know, 12 to 20 new ads per
adset every week or even more frequent
than that. So, you can definitely do
more, especially with this new update of
the algorithm. You can do a lot of
creative diversity and a lot of creative
testing. Our sweet spot is four to six.
That's usually where we are able to have
an intention behind every ad and keep
that quality uh while also having
sufficient volume. Now for each of these
batches, there should be a unique angle.
So it should be focused on a specific
problem, specific book, a specific
segment within your audience. So this
really comes down to understanding what
people actually care about with your
product like what are the benefits or
what are the problems that are being
solved for the different demographics,
right? And then you launch them. And
again, this is a CBO campaign. So likely
when you launch a new batch, a new
adset, it will take a bit of time before
this starts to get spanned. So we need
to be patient here. But the beauty here
is you can just keep a bunch of active
adsets in the testing campaign over
time. And once it's been running for a
couple of weeks and you see that it's
not been getting a lot of spend and it's
not really pulling in the result, maybe
had your average order value like three,
four times in total spend, but it's not
getting you the rorowass or the target
CPA that you're looking for, then you
can just pause it, turn it off. Okay.
Um, other than that, just continue to
feed this one with new concepts every
week at least. This is what we do, okay?
You let it run and over time you're
going to find winners. And by winners, I
mean ads that are hitting your target
CPA or ROS and it's getting the volume
of spend. So, we know that these results
are reliable. Now, what volume of spend
is required before we introduce this to
the scaling campaign? That totally
depends on the budget that you currently
have on the scaling campaign. Point here
is like we need to be able to look at
this as a proper winner. It needs to be
reliable. So it needs to have I would
say at least couple double digits of
conversions and in terms of spend it
should get at least um you know your
average order value times five in span
before we can start to consider this as
a winner. Okay. So the next thing we do
is we move this ad into the scaling
campaign. And keep in mind as well
you're going to keep this ad active
within the testing campaign. So we're
not going to turn it off when we
transfer it. We're going to keep it
active in the testing but also in the
scaling. So we're going to move it over
here. But what is really important is
that you duplicate the ad ID to keep the
social engagement on it. Okay? So
comments, shares, likes, those things,
those are actually really important to
get results from an ad. And if you
duplicate the ad, put it into the
scaling, but it loses that social
engagement, then it's not going to be
the exact same ad. It's going to take
longer to get it to work again within
the scaling campaign. So it's very
important that you do this process
properly. So let me show you exactly how
you do this process. So when you find a
winner within one of these batches that
you're testing, so I'm just showing you
here as an example. Uh for example, in
our case, we're seeing some good results
from batch number four. Okay? And then
we go and check which of these ads are
actually bringing in the results. Then
we check the cost per result and if it
looks pretty good compared to our
target, then next thing you want to do
is actually go into the ad itself. Okay?
So you want to click the charts, scroll
down, and then check the social
engagement in the bottom here. Okay? So
you see 221 uh likes or reactions, 35
comments and 12 shares. This is
definitely something we want to keep
when we put it into the scaling
campaign. So the way we do that is
clicking the share button. So you can
see the the post on Facebook with
comments and then in the top URL here
you can see next to posts you have an
ID. So we can copy this ID. Then we go
back to the ad account and then you go
into the scaling campaign. Okay. So we
were now in the testing campaign. We now
go to the scaling campaign and then
click on the adset. go in here and click
uh create. And then you would give it
the same name but winner. You would add
winner next to it. So I'm just going to
add winner batch 4 as a name here. Click
continue. And then under ad setup, you
want to make sure you select use
existing post. Then scroll down and then
we're going to select the post. Okay. So
select post. Put in the ID that we
copied. Should come up. Select it.
Continue. And this is now the ad that
you would launch. And that's exactly the
process that we're using. Now for the
scaling campaign. Again the account
budget for this. Uh so looking at the
total ad spend for your ad account. This
campaign itself should have between 60
to 80%. So the campaign type here is
advantage plus sales campaign. And
budget type is still daily. Um and then
you have just one broad ad. But again we
want to exclude existing customers. And
then you put all your winners within
this ad set. And the thing here you can
have up to 50 active ads. So over time
you probably will reach 50 active ads.
But what we do when we start reaching
that level, we just turn off the ones
that aren't getting spent cuz it's
probably just a few of these ads that
will get spent over time. Some of them
are going to not perform as well
anymore, and you're going to have some
that get more spend than others. And at
some point, it's going to make sense to
cut some of them out and introduce new
winners. Okay? Now, there's also
something known as ad fatigue. At some
point, ads will stop to perform. So, it
also makes sense that you cut those and
you add in new winners that you get from
your testing campaign. So, I've now
shown you exactly what we're doing to
get great results in 2025. I would
highly recommend to implement this if
you aren't already doing this. So, as
you can see with the new meta ads
algorithm, creative diversity is key,
but creative diversity isn't as easy as
just uploading ads. You need to have an
intentional plan of testing and then
introducing winners into your scaling
campaign. It's very important that you
follow this framework in order to
actually get good results. Now, a key
step to making this work is making sure
that every new batch is a new concept.
It's a totally different type of ad and
it's not just iterations of the best
performers. You can also do that and I
would highly recommend that you do
create iterations of things that are
working really well. But in addition to
that, it should also very often be a
totally new approach you're taking. So
our rule of thumb in my agency, Strand
Media, is that when we creating ads for
clients, there should be at least 50%
iterations. So if we're creating a batch
of four ads, two of them should be
iterations of what we see works the best
right now. Two of them should be what we
call big swings. That means something
that's totally new based on not just our
own data, but what we're seeing in the
market right now. So, if we're working
on a client that has a few competitors
that we know are doing really well, then
we always keep an eye on what they're
doing to kind of get ideas for how we
can test something brand new that might
be performing well for them. But we also
look at other industries and see what
they're doing and using that inspiration
to see how we can take some big swings
and test a new concept that we haven't
tried before. And that is how you end up
with this creative diversity in your ad
account of high performing ads that are
all scalable and proven to work.
Obviously, there's no easy hack here.
This actually takes a lot of effort. And
