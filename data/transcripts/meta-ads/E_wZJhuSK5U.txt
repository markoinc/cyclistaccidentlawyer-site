Over the last few months, something very
interesting has happened. Obviously,
Meta has rolled out Andromeda and
everything changed. Performance patterns
shifted and right on Q, the internet
filled up with videos saying things
like, "The one campaign method is dead."
In almost every one of those videos,
they show the one campaign setup the
wrong way. Then they criticize it while
it's still outperforming much of the
rest of their account. Hi, I'm Charlie.
I created the original one campaign
method and today I'm bringing you the
one campaign method 2.0 and we're
calling it Andromeda 1. In this video,
I'm going to open up my ad account where
I spend my money and I'm going to show
you how to set up the Andromeda 1
correctly, how to move away from
bloated, complicated accounts, and how
to scale your business with more
confidence and make more money. By the
end of this video, you'll have the exact
playbook you'll need for the whole year
and your bank account and mental health
will thank you. So instead of arguing
theory, let me show you what this
actually looks like inside of a real ad
account. This is a higher spend account,
which means we can reliably push
multiple adsets out of learning. And
that gives us something most advertisers
never get. Signal clarity. So let's
start with the structure breakdown.
Adset one is our control. This is the
benchmark. It contains a small number of
proven ads. Not winners forever, just
ads that are good enough to scale from
and rely on. Then ad set two and three.
These are the tests. Each of these
contains a 322 flex ad with one purpose
only. To improve the single worst ad
inside of the control ad set, not to
beat the whole campaign. Not to find a
unicorn. Not to always graduate a post
ID. Just to improve upon the weakest
link. We are not testing to find winners
to scale and abuse. We are testing to
answer one simple question. Did this
change make the campaign better or
worse? Now, let's talk about how to
judge a test. This is the most important
part of Andromeda 1 and where almost
every one of the experts on the internet
completely screws it up. What we're
measuring here is not individual CPA or
individual rorowaz or which ad looks
best. It's a volume conversation, not a
vanity one. The only question we need to
ask is did total revenue minus ad spent
get better? This is what we call profit
volume. And it's a simple custom metric
that I have in every ad account. If yes,
we can invest more. If no, the test is a
loser. That's it. Real quick, if you

brand new course on Andromeda 1.
Literally soup to nuts. Everything you
need from setup to scale. Automated
rules for low budgets, high budgets,
literally everything you need to see
more success and less stress. The link
is right there. All right, that being
said, let's get back to it. Budget
behavior is the signal. Now, here's
where this gets really powerful. When
the test ads launch, we watch two
things. Did the new ads get spent? If
not, they're not good enough. The test
fails immediately.
Next, do the campaign performance
improve or degrade? If spend shifts and
performance improves, the test is a
winner regardless of what any
attribution has to say. If the spend
shifts and performance on the campaign
worsens, it's a bad test regardless of
what any attribution has to say. It does
not matter which ad won, which CPA was,
what creative felt good. Only the
business outcome matters. This structure
gives us something that almost none of
those experts and agency owners actually
have certainty. Because we know exactly
what changed, when it changed, and how
it impacted the system, we can say with
confidence whether that change had a
positive or negative impact on the
account and our business. And here's the
hidden upside, the cross channel effect.
Often what happens is this. Facebook
looks slightly worse, but total store
volume will go up. The site converts
better. Search and email drive more
revenue. And returning customer revenue
goes up, too, because we're driving more
of the right people. We're buying
customers, not just trying to sell
products at whatever attributed margin
is most sexy. According to the report,
we're not trying to define success as
stealing credit for the last click. And
this is the difference between
optimizing ads as performance marketer
and being a growth marketer scaling a
business. This structure, by the way,
also quietly solves ad fatigue. What
most people call ad fatigue is usually
just bad campaign management. It's
operator error. In Andromeda 1, winners
rarely have competition. And when they
do, it's intentional. And we know
immediately if that competition is good
or bad. So performance decay isn't
mysterious. It's measurable. It's
avoidable. And sometimes it happens on
purpose. And that's totally fine. If
we're replacing somebody on the team
with somebody better, that's a good
thing. What Andromeda 1 is actually
optimizing for where similarity beats
scale. To really understand Andromeda 1,
you have to understand what it's
actually trying to do because it's not
optimizing ads. The entire purpose of
Andromeda 1 is to increase the volume of
high quality data flowing into the
platform so that the system can find
more and more similar people, not more
hot pockets of different folks, more
people who look alike, who behave alike,
who move through the customer journey in
your business in very similar ways. Most
ad accounts do the opposite. They try to
sell a thousand products to a thousand
different people who all buy once and
disappear. that creates messy data,
inconsistent behavior, fragile
performance, and nothing compounds.
Plus, managing CRO and email and all the
other stuff is a complete nightmare.
Andromeda 1 flips that entirely.
Instead, we focus on a small number of
ideal customer avatars who all behave
similarly, buy multiple times, and move
through the funnel in the same way. Then
we go get thousands of them. And when
the platform starts getting higher
transaction volume from users who behave
similarly, something powerful happens.
The data gets cleaner, which means
better prediction, better delivery,
better future matching, better job at
getting the right ad to the right
person. And it does so cheaper with
greater reach at lower CAC. And this
doesn't just help ads. It unlocks scale
everywhere. Search traffic converts
better. Email converts better. SMS
converts better. Creative insights get
clearer. Your entire customer journey
improves end to end because you
stabilized the first step. Because now
we're not optimizing a channel. We're
training the entire system to find our
best people. And this singularity and
similarity in the customer journey is
why the value of our efforts and the
quality of it will always be more
important than the volume of it. It's
also where Andromeda changed everything.
And I couldn't be more happy about it.
When ads last longer and collect more
data, the machine doesn't just optimize,
it learns. It learns which ads to show
to which person in which order, at which
moment. And Andromeda is better at this
than anything that has ever existed
before. And it's easier to program than
any algorithm has ever been. And that's
because it's no longer obsessive being
the last touch. It's not trying to take
credit. It's not trying to steal
attribution. It's not handing out a cup
of water at mile 25 and claiming that's
why somebody finished the marathon. Old
performance marketing was all about one
question. Who gets credit for the
finish? Andromeda and Meta at a larger
scale doesn't care about that anymore.
It's trying to do something way more
important, something much bigger. It's
trying to get more people to start the
marathon. Everything now is about
incremental lift. That means more right
people entering the journey, more people
behaving similarly, more predictable
outcomes downstream. And that is exactly
why launching a ton of ads that all
launch at the bottom of the funnel and
just spamming it breaks the system. When
you launch tons of ads and they all
chase the same last click credit, you
create chaotic customer journeys,
different hooks, different promises,
different motivations, which means you
have a whole ton of different customer
journey potentials to have to optimize
for. The machine can't tell which ad to
show to which person or in which
sequence because everyone looks
different and some ads that were here
yesterday might not be there tomorrow.
And when users don't look or behave
similarly, the data gets noisy. The
learning slows, the system never
stabilizes. You're not scaling a
business. You're just trying to make a
buck today so you don't go out of
business. And you stay stuck there. This
is the difference between hunters and
farmers. Hunters being performance
marketers measure success by rorowaz.
They ask, "Did this ad return today?
What's my cost right now? Did this work
immediately?" They live and die by
shortterm performance. And you see this
from all of the big YouTubers out there.
That's what they're focused on. Every
day is a hunt. Miss today and they panic
tomorrow. However, farmers, growth
marketers, measure success by total
volume of profit. They ask, did this
increase the amount of money the
business made? Did this make the system
stronger? Is momentum easier to maintain
than it was before? Do we have a higher
confidence what's going to happen
tomorrow, next week, and next month?
Because the better we get at this, the
less work it takes to keep growing. It's
not more effort, it's less. Andromeda is
really smart. And it only stays smart if
we don't spend all of our time and
energy keeping it stupid. Now, I hope

There's a link right there. All right,
with that being said, let's get back to
it. When we stop fragmenting data, stop
forcing chaos, and stop chasing last
touch wins, we let the system learn
deeply. And once it does, growth
compounds with less input, not more. One
farmer can feed a thousand hunters.
Andromeda one is farming. It's saying,
"Let's train the system on a small set
of ideal customer avatars. Let's get
thousands of them. Let's let learning
compound and let every channel improve
as a result." That's how real scale
happens. That's how real businesses are
built. That's how empires are made.
That's the difference between somebody
who is good at making a sale and
somebody who's good at buying customers,
a performance marketer and a growth
expert. Now, the constraint of budget,
there's a reality we have to respect. If
your budget is low, you don't get
infinite data. And if you can't get more
than one adset out of learning, you
can't force a mature structure. So,
Andromeda 1 can bend to that need. Which
brings us to the low budget strategy.
When budget is constrained, our job
isn't to outenineer the platform. The
job is to maximize data quality inside
of the smallest possible structure.
This is the lowbudget rule and it is not
negotiable. If you can't reliably get
one adset out of learning, everything
lives in one adset. That's not a
compromise. That's the correct strategy.
And I see a lot of people doing that at
mass scale, complaining it doesn't work,
but it's because it's only designed for
a lowbudget setup. one campaign, one ad
set, and a handful of 322 flex ads. We
don't force isolation. We don't use
premature structures. We don't have a
lot of exclusions and we don't base
things on rorowaz. The goal here is
simple. Increase transaction volume
until the budget can support more signal
separation. Let's get to the place where
we can afford to have multiple adsets so
we can set up in a mature ad account.
Once volume increases, the data
stabilizes, the similarity increases and
predictability improves and we can go to
bigger audiences and we can scale
further. And now naturally you can
afford to graduate into control adsets
and test adsets. But remember, you're
always scaling everything inside of that
one campaign. And each campaign that you
run needs to have a very specific
business objective. This is clean
experimentation. Not because you wanted
complexity, not because you're lazy, but
because the account demands one specific
setup versus another. And it earned that
growth. This is why Andromeda 1 scales
so well. It adapts to low budgets and to
high budgets and everything in between
because ultimately what you're doing is
you're programming the machine to do one
job very well with a clear delineation
of success and a very easy way to
measure every change in the impact on
your business and you never have to
change that philosophy. So now that you
understand what Andromeda 1 actually is,
it's not a tactic, it's not a hack, it's
not a structure you copy from a
screenshot. Andromeda 1 is a decision to
stop being a hunter and start being a
farmer. To stop asking, did this work
today and start asking did this make my
system smarter? Did this increase the
volume of similar customers? Is growth
easier to maintain than it was before?
Ultimately, can we spend more money
tomorrow? Because when the answer to
those questions is yes, profit follows
automatically. If you keep your
structure simple, you let ads live long
enough to learn, and you focus on
similarity rather than chaos, you
increase budget only when the system
earns it, Andromeda will do what it's
designed to do. It will compound. And
compounding interest is the most
powerful force in the entire universe.
And the less you interfere, the better
it gets. This is why people think the
one campaign method doesn't work. They
keep their system stupid. They interrupt
learning. They chase short-term
validation. and they try a thousand
things in a thousand different places.
Then they blame the system and say,
"Well, the platform works differently
for everybody." No, it doesn't. It's
software. Excel works the same for
everybody. So does Meta. Once Andromeda
starts working, the fastest way to
destroy it is by touching the budget at
the wrong time, by launching more ads,
by doing everything you can to
destabilize the win that you have. If
you can increase the budget, don't do
anything else. Now, we talked about the
structure. What we need to understand
also is the best kind of ad. And in this
video, I'm going to show you exactly
what you should be doing, the greatest
kind of ad you can build, and how to
best weaponize machine learning and
data. Also, down here, you'll find links
