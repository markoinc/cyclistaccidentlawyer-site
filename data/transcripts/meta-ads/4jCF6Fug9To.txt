Between my brands, clients, and
students, I'm helping people spend well
over a million dollars a week on meta
ads. And right now, the most
misunderstood and underused ad format on
the entire platform is the 322 flexible
ad. At its base level, a flexible ad is
simple. You're giving Meta multiple
creative inputs, and you're letting the
system decide how to combine and present
them for each impression. We're going to
start by opening up the account and
building one together step by step. If
you've been working harder and harder
every month just to maintain the same
results, this is going to make a lot of
things click. All right, let's get into
it. So, let's actually build one of
these together. I'm inside of the ads
manager now and I'm going to create a
new ad so you can see exactly where this
lives and how it works. At the ad level,
instead of choosing a standard ad
format, we're going to choose flexible
ad. This is the format that replaced
dynamic creatives, and it's where the
entire 322 system lives. That means
three creatives, two headlines, and two
primary texts. Nothing more than that.
First, we'll add three creatives. These
should be three videos or three images,
not a mix.
We want the system comparing like for
like. We're not asking Meta to decide
between formats and messages at the same
time. That's not a good test. If you
want to test images versus video, do
that in separate flexible ads, not
inside the same one. Then we add two
primary texts, different angles,
different hooks, different reasons to
care.
Next, we add two headlines. These should
be meaningfully different, not small
wording tweaks, but two distinct ways of
framing the value, not rewritten
versions of the same idea. And that's
it. Three creatives, two headlines, two
primary texts. Three, two, two. that
gives meta 12 possible combinations to
work with and this part is very
important. We are not trying to give
everything a fair chance. Now, I hope
you're enjoying watching this video as
much as I enjoyed making it. And I want
to take a moment and just say thank you
for watching it. Go ahead and smash the

you don't miss any future videos, and

the assistance that you need, all the
things that we talk about in this video.
There's a link right there. All right,
with that being said, let's get back to
it. Spend is a meritocracy. The system
is going to put more spend behind the
combinations that create the best
experience and the best outcome based on
early data. And that's exactly what we
want. There's no placement customization
here. No aspect ratio micromanagement.
No guessing which version goes where.
Now that you've seen exactly how simple
this is to build, the real question
becomes, why does this work so much
better than launching separate post IDs?
And that is what we're going to break
down next. Separate buckets versus
shared learning. There's one really
important thing to understand about how
Meta learns. When you run ads one by
one, every single ad learns on its own.
Each post ID has its own data, its own
learning, and its own history and social
proof. Think of it like this. Every ad
is filing its results into a separate
bucket. And those buckets don't talk to
each other. So, if you launch five
separate ads, you don't get five ads
learning together. You get five ads
competing. One ad might get the
conversion, another gets the click, and
another looks great for a day or two,
but none of that information is shared.
And when one ad starts to look better,
Meta will shift spend towards it. That
spend has to come from somewhere, and
most of the time, unless you're
increasing the budget, it comes from
your other ads, even the ones that were
already working. And that's why older
ads suddenly look worse when you launch
a bunch of new tests because those new
tests launch at the bottom of the funnel
and steal all of the data. People
usually call this ad fatigue, but most
of the time it's not fatigue, it's
fragmented learning and spamming the
bottom of the funnel. A 322 flexible ad
works very differently. Instead of
separate buckets, all of the data flows
into one place. The creatives don't
learn alone. The headlines don't learn
alone. The primary texts don't learn
alone. They learn together.
So when something starts to work, that
information doesn't get trapped inside
of one ad. It can be leveraged across
all ads inside of the 322. And it
carries that forward. That's the shift.
Instead of the system constantly
resetting itself, it starts building on
what it already knows. Instead of having
dozens of low data sources with low
confidence, it is all consolidated into
one place. Next, I want to show you why
this matters so much over time and how
keeping this structure simple is what
makes success easier than ever. Why
three creatives and only two of each
copy? This is where the 322 structure
really matters. We all know one thing
for sure. Creative moves the needle more
than anything else. So our job isn't to
overwhelm the machine with options. Now
in Google, you are trying to overwhelm
with options because you want every
single possible thing that somebody
could have typed in to be represented.
But on Meta, we're not trying to account
for everyone. We want the best users. We
want the machine to be able to make the
best choices. Our job is to give Meta
and Andromeda the best chance to find
the best creative as fast as possible
for the right person in the right order.
That's why we only give it three
creatives. With three, Meta can make a
real decision quickly. One creative will
usually separate itself pretty fast.
Spend will then concentrate. Signals get
clear. And remember, one creative is
four types of ads because those two
primary text and two headlines. But if
you load five or 10 creatives into one
flexible ad, the learning slows down and
often whatever gets lucky early is the
only thing that gets spend out of the
entire ad. Not because meta is bad, but
because you've given it too many
questions to answer at once, so it goes
off of any win it can find. Three
creatives is enough variety to learn
without creating noise. Now, if you want
to test more than three creatives, you
don't put them all in one ad. You create
multiple 322 flexible ads. If you want
to test six creatives, that's simply two
322 ads. Now, something really important
happens. Instead of one crowded bucket
or dozens that are all completely
isolated, you've created two clean
places for all of your data to go. Each
ad gets its own chance to earn spend.
Each ad gets its own learning path and
life cycle. And because both ads can be
built around the same concept, you're
not changing the strategy. You're just
increasing opportunity. That gives the
machine more room to work, not more
confusion. This also lets you test copy
in a much, much smarter way that I don't
see anybody talking about. If both
flexible ads use the same headlines and
primary text, now you can watch what
happens to spend. If the same copy
dominates in both ads, that is a real
signal, that copy is doing the work. And
if performance differs, even when the
copy is the same, you know that the copy
isn't the reason the ad is winning or
losing. You can really point to the
creative with much higher confidence.
And that is incredibly useful. It tells
you whether a result is something you
can trust or something that's just lucky
or perhaps something that is driven by a
specific creative that is real AB
testing one variable at a time fast
learning and clean signals. And instead
of guessing which win matters and trying
to infer something that is completely
out of your control, the machine tells
you. And that's the difference between
chasing performance and building a
system you can actually rely on with a
feedback loop that allows you to get
better and better over time. And once a
322 flexible ad has been running for a
bit, the most important signal to look
at is still spend. Spend tells you what
the machine believes. And when spend
concentrates and the campaign is better
because of it, that is a real winner.
Whether that's around 1322 or one
element within it. Now, here's something
really, really important. There is no
rush to pull post IDs. The worst thing
anyone can do is interrupt something
that's already working. Flexible ads are
doing their job. They're learning,
they're improving, and they're driving
results. We don't stop that. What we can
do is start harvesting from what is
going well. Think of flexible ads as
your proving ground, as your testing
environment. And in your one campaign
control ads set is where you put all of
the proven assets. So when you see a
flexible ad performing well, you don't
shut it off. You don't stop good things.
You don't turn off good money. You
simply start pulling the best performing
post IDs and introduce it into the
control environment. That way, you're
not replacing anything. You're just
adding evidence and leverage. And this
is where the system really, really
starts to work. And one thing I want to
call out here is I do not expect the
single post ID that you pull to
necessarily perform as well as the whole
322. It is the all-star on the team, not
the whole team. And when you put it
inside of an adset of other allstars,
now it's a contributor to a team that is
much greater than the team it came from.
Right? An allstar team is built of
everybody who's good, right? It's a
collection of unicorns. We can't expect
them all to dominate in the same way
when it was one unicorn with a whole
bunch of scrubs. That's just not the way
it works. So, don't be alarmed when
performance doesn't look the exact same,
especially right away. So, let's talk
about how to get the post ID. How to
grab the post ID inside of your business
manager. I want you to go to your inbox.
Look for the ads getting the most
comments and engagement. When you have a
real winner, a real unicorn from a 322,
it won't be subtle. When you have a
great white shark in the backyard pool,
you notice it. You'll see people
reacting, commenting, and engaging.
Simply click the timestamp on that post
and it will take you directly to that
ad. The URL will contain the post ID or
the video ID. All you have to do now is
copy that and then head back inside of
the ads manager and you can create a new
ad inside your one campaign control ad
set. And from there, you choose use
existing post and you paste that ID,
whether it's the post ID or the video
ID. That's it. Now, you've isolated the
unicorn, the great white shark in the
backyard pool, and you've added it to
your all-star team. And now you can
watch how that same asset performs along
with your other proven ads in a stable,
controlled environment while still
letting the thing that's winning
continue to win. And if it holds up,
you've found something you can trust.
And if it doesn't, nothing breaks. If it
just doesn't work, isolate it. That's
okay. Maybe the reason it worked is
because the flexible ad was great, but
on its own, it's just not enough. And
because the flexible ad is still
running, still learning, and still
winning, the system continues to get
better. And that's the beauty of this
system. You're never betting the account
on a guess. You're letting flexible ads
find strength and letting the control
environment confirm it and ultimately
just level up the floor. So, you're
constantly just getting better. If the
baseline continues to improve, it's hard
for you to not continue to make more
money. Before we move on, I want to zoom
out for a second and try to tie
everything together. Because once you
see this as a system, everything gets
simpler. So, step number one is flexible
ads. This is where you test, not by
guessing, not by launching dozens of
post IDs where you hope you got the
right copy of the right creative and it
hits the right person. in the right way
with all the other ads running, but by
giving the machine a clean 322 structure
so that learning stays shared and the
signals stay clear. Flexible ads are
your proven ground. This is where you
test. Step two is you harvest. When
something starts to dominate spend and
the campaign is better because of it,
you don't rush. You don't turn anything
off. You simply observe and you scale
your budgets, right? You take advantage
of that leverage. And when you're ready
to pull the best performing post ID from
what's already winning, you go to your
inbox, the comment section, and grab it.
That's how you scale. Now, step three is
control. That post ID goes into the one
campaign control ad set. This is your
stable environment. Proven ads, clean
comparisons. You're not replacing
winners. You're introducing contenders
and letting them prove they belong
amongst all of the other allstars,
right? This is your unicorn squad,
right? Step four is scale. If the asset
holds up in the control and your
campaign continues to look good, you can
continue to increase the budget, not
because your dashboard looks exciting,
but because the system can support it
and your bank account and business
results have proven this is good for
you. And if it doesn't hold up, nothing
breaks. just turn off that single
identified post ID because the flexible
ad is still running. It's still
learning. It's still feeding the system.
And if it's still doing good enough, you
don't turn it off. And that is the loop.
You launch the flexible ad specifically
to improve upon the weakest link of your
control. You harvest the post ID. You
introduce that into the control. And if
the results continue to improve, you
just add budget. No panic, no guesswork,
no constant resets. just a system that
gets stronger over time and makes the
answer to the most important question
which is can I spend more money yes more
often than it is no. And if you can do
that by even 5% three times a week, you
can double your budget every single
month. If there's one thing I really
want you to take away from this, it's
that you don't scale by working harder.
You scale by building a better system
that gives you more leverage. Flexible
ads aren't a trick. They're
infrastructure. They let learning stay
shared. They let signals get clear. And
they give you a way to test without
constantly resetting your account. When
you combine that with a clean process,
flexible as the test, harvesting what's
already winning, validating in the
control environment and scaling only
when all of that holds up, you stop
guessing, you stop panicking, and you
stop breaking things, and you start
making a lot more money. The goal isn't
perfect ads. The goal isn't to just win
creative tests over and over again. The
goal is to be able to answer one
question with confidence. Can I spend
more money tomorrow? If the answer is
yes, you increase the budget. If the
answer is no, you test deliberately
until the answer is a yes. That's how
the best advertisers grow. Not by
chasing winners, but by building systems
that win again and again. So, now that
you know how 322 ads work, in this next
video, I'm going to show you how to
actually set up your creative test to
scale your business. We're going to dive
in deeper to the mechanics of everything
so that you have the confidence and the
decisions you're going to make. Don't
