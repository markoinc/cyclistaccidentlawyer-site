All right. So, in this video, I'm going
to be showing you guys how I'm going to
be setting up and running my meta ads
for 2026, which is now this year, which
is actually crazy. I'm literally
recording this on the 1st of January.
So, maybe I'm the first person to
release a video about meta ads, but I
assume someone has probably already done
it uh for 2026. So, with that being
said, let's just go ahead and get
straight into it. So, I was kind of
using this strategy uh at the end of
2025, kind of just like in December
pretty much, and I think it's working
pretty well. So, what I'm doing is I'm
creating a campaign which is just
testing and trying to find like a
winning video. Um, I just have the
highest volume here for the biz
strategy. Kind of your basics. Uh,
nothing special here. Um, but I'll show
you guys what it looks like inside of
this campaign. So, inside of the
campaign, uh, I just create like an ad
set that you guys just saw. And inside
of that ad set, I have 10 different ads
here that are all running. And I have a
budget, like I said, of $75, I think,
which is honestly probably too little
for how many ads I actually have inside
of this uh campaign here because it's
hard to distribute $75 to 10 different
ads. But, uh, this was kind of just like
a test to see, I guess, like how it
would work. And I guess it's probably
helpful for you guys to know that you
don't have to spend a whole bunch of
money just to define a winning video.
But just looking on this dashboard here,
we don't have to go in and click on all
these different videos cuz we can just
see here that uh this one had zero
website purchases. And if you click on
the videos, it shows you more of a uh
like a analytics page. I'll just go here
for the charts on this one. This one
tried getting some ad spend, but Meta
just immediately saw that uh I mean it
just had really bad uh stats, so Meta
just turned it off and decided to spend
the money elsewhere. So, let's go to
like this Tik Tok ad 10. uh which I
think is the best performing one. Yeah,
54 website purchases. Uh 8.90 per
purchase. Uh yesterday was like 3.91. So
yeah, definitely a lot better than some
of the other ones in this campaign. And
this is actually going to be the one
that I'm going to be taking from this
campaign and creating a new campaign
just for this ad. Um so yeah, let's just
go back into that ad set really quick.
There was one other ad in here that did
decent which had six website purchases
with a 2.18 rorowaz. So, not terrible.
So, I could definitely take these two
probably and then scale those up, but
I'm just going to be focusing on this
one right here. So, the next step is to
obviously go ahead and create a new
campaign for the ad. And I'm going to be
creating a sales campaign because I'm
selling something. Uh, let's go to
continue. And we could just do like
winning ad. Uh, obviously, you can name
this to whatever. I'm going to keep
pretty much everything here default as
what meta suggests. I honestly don't
change a lot. Uh, I feel like everything
is just AI optimized nowadays. And I
just find kind of the best results in
that. I'm just going to be doing the
campaign budget. And for the daily
budget, you can honestly start at $20,
probably the lowest 25. And I'm
literally just going to keep it at that.
Uh there's no need to be spending $100 a
day. I mean, you can since you already
kind of know that this is, I guess, a
winning ad, but I still kind of like to
just start it out low. uh probably $50
uh for this since I'm kind of more
confident in knowing that this ad is
going to be performing better than maybe
some other ones I'd be testing. So, I'm
going to be doing $50 daily budget for
this. Let's go ahead and hit next. I'm
going to say this is a Tik Tok ad
because basically another thing that I
didn't mention is all those videos that
I put in that campaign were all videos
that got a decent amount of views on Tik
Tok organically. So, it's kind of like a
cheat code. you take like their organic
videos that are doing well and then you
export those into meta ads since you
already know like these performed pretty
well on Tik Tok just organically without
pays. So hopefully they do the same when
you add some money to it. But as you
saw, not all of them did super well.
You're going to get different results
from organic views and paid ads. It's
just kind of how it is. So let's go
ahead and make sure everything here is
good. I'll just make sure that you have
your conversion event at purchase. I'm
just going to have this start at 11:00
a.m. today. So uh let's just go ahead
and run that. As you can see, I mean,
this is proof that I'm recording on
January 1st, too. Um, but yeah, let's go
ahead and look at the rest of the
settings here. Like I said, I keep
pretty much everything default for the
most part, but I am going to change a
few things later on. So, in the
placements here, I'm just going to hit
show more settings. And for platforms,
I'm honestly just going to be doing
Facebook and Instagram. Uh, let's go
ahead and hit next. And for the ad
setup, I'm going to do create ad manual
upload. And we're just going to go ahead
and create single image or video for the
format. And then I'm going to toggle off
this multi-advertiser
ads. And then we just need to get our
link for the website. Always make sure
that this is on your landing page or for
the most part you want to make sure it's
on your landing page. Now let's go up to
the setup creative and do video ad. I'm
just going to go ahead and hit next. And
then for the media, I can go ahead and
select that ad that I had. All right. So
I went ahead and selected that video
that I had on that winning ad. Um, let's
just go ahead and hit skip and continue.
For the crop, I'm just going to leave
this on original for all of those and
then go ahead and go to next. And for
the primary text, I'm just going to be
using Shad GBT. I already have some
primary text here that I'm going to be
using. I'm just going to copy and paste
those. Add another text option. And just
copy another one of these that Chad GBT
created. Go ahead and paste that in
here. Let's go ahead and add another
one. And then for the headline, I'm just
going to be doing the same thing. I have
a couple different chatbt options here
that I'm going to be choosing. I'm
honestly just going to have two
different options here to choose from or
for meta to choose from. Um, and then
leave everything off. Let's go ahead and
add a description as well. Copy and
paste that. And then a call to action.
Make sure that this is on shop now or at
least if you are selling a product. Now,
let's go ahead and hit next. Um, I'm
just going to keep translate text on. I
think that's helpful. And I'm not going
to add video effects, video touch-ups,
text improvements. No, I'm just going to
leave honestly all that off. And then go
ahead and hit done. All right. So, now
you can see all of our primary text,
headlines, and all of that good stuff is
imported into here. I'm just going to
make sure everything else looks good.
Yeah, I think everything is honestly
ready to go. Um, so from here, you just
go ahead and hit publish and let Meta do
its thing. All right, so that ad is now
processing and going to start
delivering, like I said, at 11:00 a.m.,
so in literally nine more minutes. So,
I'll definitely keep you guys updated.
And if you want to see like an updated
video maybe on just this ad and see how
it does performance-wise or whatever,
then I could definitely make an update
video if you want to see that. But this
is probably going to be my strategy
going forward for 2026. If I have any
other ideas, then I'll definitely post
them on this channel or maybe on my Tik
Tok or Instagram. Just some quick little
updates on there if you want to go ahead
and follow me over there. But yeah, if
you want to see more videos like this in
the future, then make sure to hit that
like button, subscribe to my channel,
and I'll see you guys on the next one.
Peace out.
