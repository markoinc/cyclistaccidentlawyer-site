I've put together the seven things that
are changing the most in Facebook ads
right now. These are essentially the new
rules for what it's like to optimize and
run Facebook ads accounts in 2026.
Across our agency, we manage millions of
dollars in direct to consumer ad spend
every single month. And what I'm seeing
right now in ad accounts is completely
different than what I saw even just 6
months ago. What I'm going to break down
goes against what you've probably been
taught. probably goes against what I
have said on this very channel right
here in the past, but they're working
right now and my bet is that they're
going to continue to work into the next
year. So, basically what we're seeing is
that the biggest brands in the world are
all increasing their creative volume
massively. We have literally seen every
large brand increase up and to the
right. And let me give you some examples
of that. So, this is a look at the media
mix from Athletic Greens. And as you can
see, a year ago, they were running on
average around 400 images and 300
videos. Now, that sounds like a lot, but
that's roughly speaking if we add the
496 and 376, that's close to a,000
active ads. Today, they're running over
6,822
ads. So, Athletic Greens, we'll write
AG1 here, went from 1,000 ads to 6K.
Let's take a look at another business
called Talentless. This is a clothing
brand. I really like to model some of
these ads. I think they do a great job.
Now, we can see back in January, they
were running 64 images and 19 videos.
Let's just call this one talent. And
let's just give them 100, we'll say,
even though it's less. They went from
100 active ads to today they're running
1,081 active ads. So, they 10xed their
ad production. AG1 6xed their ad
production. And by the way, every brand
is doing this. You could just name any
big brand that's actually scaling and
you will see a chart that looks just
like this. Let's take Gap here for
example. that started back in January
running 130 to 150 ads. Let's call it
150. And today they are running 6,353
ads. We're just going to say 6K plus. I
don't even know what the multiple on
that. It's a 60x multiple roughly
speaking. 50x multiple. We have seen
these three ginormous brands scale so
significantly by having creative at
scale. This is the trend. Anyone that
tells you otherwise is too lazy to
create creative, which leads me to my
second point, the creative engine. Now,
the creative engine is what allows
businesses to scale their ads so
quickly. It's what allows you to see so
many different variations from the same
company, seemingly making you not
fatigue from looking at so many ads at
the same time. And whether you're a
brand that's literally running your
first round of ads today after watching
this video or if you're trying to
actually aggressively scale, I'm going
to break down how these engines work.
They get more complex as you grow and
grow, but generally these four steps are
what need to be followed. So, every
creative engine starts at the top with
launching new ads. We're just going to
call this launch. The next thing you do
after launch is you have a grace period.
This grace period is somewhere between 7
and 14 days. This is when you're just
hanging out, evaluating your ads,
pausing down absolute duds and scaling
winners. This is just allowing those ads
to breathe and really give them a fair
chance. After that 14-day period, you
have to do analysis. Now, that analysis
needs to have factored in incremental
attribution. So, we're going to add a
very important note here. This needs to
be incremental analysis. And what I mean
by this is you're looking not just at
7-day click one day view, but you're
actually looking at incremental
attribution in your Facebook ads
platform. And then after you analyze
that, it's time to brief. And brief
really means you're taking your best
performing creatives from your ad
account and you are, yes, briefing to
actually see if you can create more
variations of these top creatives, these
concepts. Now, there's a wild card that
can come in, and this is very important
in this briefing process. You also need
to be taking competitor ads, as I'm
inserting out of left field, literally,
and brief in on those as well. So the
combination is you're taking your ads
that are actually working the best
already for you in your ad account and
you're taking your competitor ads and
you're briefing new concepts and
iterations together and then you launch
those new ads. This is a constant cycle
and this is how you build a very basic
but robust creative engine. The third
rule is that oversimplistic campaign
strategies are gone. And I'll call this
no more one campaign method. Now the
basis of this method falls into a very
simple philosophy. Facebook is smarter
than us, which it kind of is, and we
could just throw all of our ads into one
single campaign. I'm here to tell you
that this breaks very quickly, and it
breaks because of the lack of swim
lanes. What we want to actually create
in our account is new customers, engaged
customers and existing customers. And
why we want this, why this is so
important, because typically Facebook
overspends on existing customers. They
spend just enough on engaged, which is
fine, and they underspend on new
customers. This is especially a problem
when you start to get to larger portions
of spend. And therefore, a lot of your
budget as a not just percentage, but
actual dollar amount is skewed into
existing customers, which ultimately
means you're not scaling new customer
acquisition, which is what you want to
do with Facebook ads, with Instagram
ads, and so on. Which leads me to the
opposite, but also extremely important
rule that I think is going to dominate
2026. At this point, before I even
showcase this rule, I want to mention
something that's really important. If
you are a brand that is trying to scale
in 2026, the average brand that we work
with saw a 41% increase in profit in the
first 90 days. So, if you want to work
with us and actually scale your ads,
take things seriously this year instead
of being at the stalemate that many
people's businesses are, then go to the
moonlighters.com
and apply to work with us. It takes 2
minutes to apply and you get on a
15minute call. If you don't like that
15-minute call, you waste 15 minutes of
your life. Best case scenario, you're
one of those businesses that scales to
41% on average. That's not our best.
It's not our worst in the first 90 days.
So, number four, is dead. What is
absolutely dead, which we'll mark on the
X over here, is any sort of
functionality where you think you could
take 20 to 30% of your budget and treat
that in testing. That is a very easy
way to lose 10, 20, 30% of your total
performance in your ad account and
create an actual cost center in your
business. What is absolutely working
here is the exact opposite. You create a
prospecting CBO and within that
prospecting CBO, you not only test here,
but you scale here and this becomes the
number one campaign. The beautiful part
about the prospecting CBO is your test
ads are actually not going to get any
spend unless they are actually better
than the rest of the ads. So you create
a hyperco competitive environment in
your own ad account. We always want our
best ads to rise to the top and
doesn't allow that because us as human
beings are way slower than the
algorithm. Number five, fastest horse is
back in action. You probably don't
actually know what this means, but I'll
give it to you in simple verbiage.
Advanced breakdowns are so back it's
crazy. We went through this period where
it was actually completely fine to just
run a bunch of your ads into the same
campaign or a couple campaigns, select
automatic placements, select everything
automatic, all genders, all locations,
and just let it rip. That period has
completely ended in 2025, and it is
going to continue to be over in 2026.
The way that we're treating what I call
the fastest horse is you want to put
your bets, meaning spend the most amount
of money on the fastest horse. And how
that generally functions are day of
week, platform, landing page, gender,
country, and the list goes on and on.
What's important to recognize that in
each of these breakdowns in your ad
platform, they all have levers that you
can pull that Facebook might not have
the exact information on for you. For
example, if you know on your Shopify
store that Mondays and Tuesdays work
better than Saturdays and Sundays, then
you should spend more on the better
performing days, but I would bet most
people spend the same amount of money
every single day. Why would you do that?
Why would you do the same thing if
Facebook works better than Instagram or
vice versa? Why would you spend the same
amount if one landing page works better
than the other? This goes all the way
down the board. Make sure that you're
always putting your money where you're
most likely to make money back. The
sixth new rule of Facebook ads is profit
over rorowaz. Rorowaz has become this
holy grail number. It's something that
everyone is just so obsessed about and
it actually does mean a lot. Rorowaz is
a very important efficiency metric. It
is simply your return on ad spend to
make sure that you're always profitable
on every single purchase. But that's all
and where it truly ends. What a lot of
brands get caught up in is they want a
very high return on ad spend. They want
a 5x. They want a 10x. That's great. I
want those numbers, too. Everyone does.
But the real question to ask yourself
is, how much profit are you leaving on
the table by forcing your business into
a very high return on ad spend? Think
about it like this. Would you rather
spend $1,000 at a 5x or $100,000 at a
1.2x? Now, I understand I'm using very
large numbers here to make a very easy
point because in this case, you're
getting $5,000 in return minus your
$1,000 in ad spend, equaling to $4,000
in profit. In this case, you're getting
a total of 120k revenue minus the 100k
ad spend, again, equaling to 20K in
total revenue. And even if these numbers
were way, way closer, even if they were
the same profit, I would always prefer
the bigger spend and the lower rorowaz.
And the reason for that is actually
simple. This allows you to build an army
of loyal customers. This is so important
for everyone to understand. The bigger
your business is, the more people talk
about your business. The more people
talk about your business, the more
residual sales you have over long
periods of time. So in all cases, you
want to take the lowest rorowaz you can
possibly afford at the highest volume.
And number seven, this is probably one
of the biggest ones because there was
new tools that came out by Facebook in
2025 that took some time for us to adopt
and get used to. And this is truly
attribution has changed. Everyone got
used to 7-day click or one-day view. And
some people said, I don't want to use
any one-day view and I'm just going to
use 7-day click or even I'm going to use
one day click. Right? This was also very
common. Now what's shifted here is the
introduction of incremental attribution.
And what incremental attribution does is
it allows us to see the purchases that
happened because of Facebook. So what we
now prefer to do is a hybrid approach.
We now prefer to really look at the
7-day click, 1-day view as the core
attribution method for the brand, but
focus on incremental attribution when
we're talking about which creatives to
scale because we know incrementally
that's most important. And in many
cases, we might actually shift
everything to incremental attribution as
long as it proves to be most successful
in testing. Now, I know I said I had
seven, but I'm going to hit you guys
with some bonuses. Every single business
needs to have a king goal. This is the
goal above all goals. This is what you
tell your media buyer, you tell your
agency. This is the goal that matters
the most. It could be an ROI goal, an ME
goal, a rorowaz goal, a CPA goal. It
could be a revenue goal. Just whatever
is most important to you. What I mean by
king goal is that you don't conflict
this goal with other goals. As long as
this goal is achieved, the business is
happy and healthy. Number two, flexible
ads are ripping right now. I don't want
to say too much about this because to be
honest, we don't have the full data to
back this up quite yet. But early
testing, flexible ads are crushing. So,
give them a shot in your ad account.
There's a very high chance that grouping
together these iterations in flexible
ads could lead to a significant increase
in your performance. And a few other
honorable mentions here. AI UGC is
getting much much better. This is
something I'm very bullish on over the
next year. In addition to that, very
similar, very connected, Meta Gen AI is
getting even stronger as well. You've
probably seen the AI enhancements show
up more and more on your ads. They're
working better and better. I'm really
interested to see what's going to happen
in 2026, and Little Birdie from Facebook
has indicated that this is going to be a
very big point. On a completely
different note, catalog ads are still
strong. This is pretty shocking to most
people at this point when we have so
many options, so many different ads. But
sometimes just showing people something
and not trying to trick them or coersse
them into buying and just saying, "Hey,
these are my products. Go buy them."
Does a great job. And then finally,
because you got this far, I want to give
a reminder that I say all the time.
Focus on the 20% of your products that
drive 80% of your revenue. This single
rule right here could be applied to
every single part of the other seven
rules that I gave you. Focus on the 20%
that drives 80% of the output in every
facet of your business and you will be
significantly more effective and more
efficient. Now, you know the rules, but
rules do not make money. Strategy and
execution makes money. If you want to
