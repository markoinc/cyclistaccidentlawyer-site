Running meta ad campaigns is nothing
like what it used to be. Here's the best
strategy for most businesses in 2026.
Instead of having a really complicated
salesunnel with lots of different
campaigns, I'd recommend that most
businesses have a scaling campaign and a
testing campaign. They would both be
targeting the same people, a mixture of
cold and warm audiences, both direct to
offer, so directly selling your products
and services to your customers. You want
to put the majority of your budget into
your scaling campaign, but leave some
budget for experimenting with creative
different offers that can set you up for
long-term success.
