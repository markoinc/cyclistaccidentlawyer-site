Most Facebook advertisers are still
using strategies that worked a couple of
years ago, but just don't produce the
best results anymore. In this video, I'm
going to give you the Facebook ads
playbook that we're using right now. The
same framework that we use with our
clients to generate tens of millions
every month. So, I'm hearing from a lot
of advertisers right now that are
struggling to get great results. And
there are a number of reasons for that.
Firstly, you've got rising costs and
CPMs, something that's not new,
something that will continue, but
something that does need to be overcome.
Secondly, attribution issues. If you
don't have accurate data coming into
your ad account, you're going to run
into problems with Meta's AI doing more
and more of the targeting and
optimization and things like that. Then
you've got ad fatigue. Producing enough
creative, enough highquality creative to
not only keep things fresh, but also
differentiate yourself from the
competition can be really hard. And then
we've just got reliance on outdated
tactics. Often things advertisers are
doing they don't even know they're doing
wrong, like focusing on interest
targeting or really segmenting out their
audiences, for example. So, in this
video, I've got a number of well, I've
got a full playbook. I've got a number
of steps, number of things I'd recommend
you do that can help overcome all those
issues and help you get significantly
better results. Okay, so let's get into
it and let's start by talking about
campaign structure. So, I now think that
the majority of advertisers should be
using Advantage Plus campaigns. And
where possible, you want to consolidate
multiple campaigns into fewer campaigns,
maybe even one campaign. We've got a lot
of ad accounts that are producing great
results that are operating literally
with one advantage plus um campaign.
Now, there are scenarios where that's
not always going to be the best. So, if
you want to break out multiple
countries, for example, into different
campaigns, absolutely fine. Or you want
to do it by product range, absolutely
fine. But the default when it comes to
campaign structure should now be less
campaigns. Less is more. Less allows you
to consolidate ad spend. It allows Meta
to learn faster because more of the
conversions are happening within the one
campaign or the one adset as opposed to
having things spread out and segmented.
And the way Meta's gone with their
targeting being highly suggestion bases
in Meta can choose to go with your
targeting options or completely ignore
them. A lot of different adsets, a lot
of different campaigns very much end up
targeting the same or similar people. A
lot of audience overlap. Things get
really difficult. Along those lines, by
default, now we are targeting both cold
and warm audiences in the same campaign
and even within the same adset because
of what I just mentioned. Even if you
try and set up an adset to just target
cold or just target warm, unless you
really go those extra steps and and
click all the sort of hidden buttons to
mean that your targeting options are
hard boundaries. Meta is going to treat
those as suggestions and you're probably
going to end up advertising to a mix of
cold and warm in your cold audience
adset and a mix of cold and warm in your
warm audience adset. Why not just bring
them all together? consolidate that data
and get better results. You also want to
add lots of different types of creative
into those adsets. You don't necessarily
want to segment it out and have, all
right, I'll have this uh creative for
this audience and this type of creative
for this warm audience or for the middle
of the funnel or anything like that.
Lump it all in together. Meta can work
it all out. We'll talk more about that
later when we get to the creative step.
And then when it comes in general to
targeting and delivery, let Meta do its
thing. you need a really good reason to
go in and manually tweak with something
or add in a schedule that affects like
optimization and delivery or or do
something that's aside from the default
let meta get you what it is that you
want. So play number two, let's talk
about creative strategy. What we're
seeing is that UGC style video, so user
generated content style video is king
right now. That's what's producing the
best results across the board. Uh you
want your ads to feel native to platform
platform. You want them to feel more
like content than an ad. If people get
the sense in that first split second
that what you're putting in front of
them is an ad, they'll immediately
scroll past or at least a higher
percentage of people will immediately
scroll past. If they feel more like it's
a bit of content, more like it's
something they might be interested in,
they're much more likely to pay
attention. You can do that through UGC,
userenerated content, so stuff you get
from your clients, your customers, you
can hire UGC um actors effectively to
create stuff for you. a lot. There's
going to be a lot of AI developments in
that space over the next few years. Or
even better, and I've talked about this
previously, go ahead and hire
influencers to create your ads for you.
They'll have that native content style
feel, especially when that ad is put in
front of people that follow that
influencer because they're used to
consuming their content. That makes it
much more likely they're going to hear
about your products and services. Makes
it much more likely they're going to
take action, buy, inquire, etc. This
doesn't just apply to e-commerce, by the
way. Big misconception within the the
Facebook ad space. You can absolutely
apply this to other types of businesses
too. In fact, sometimes you get a
greater competitive advantage there
because your competitors aren't doing
it. Now, one of the things that I know
people find very daunting with producing
a lot of creative a lot of video assets,
which is now what's recommended, is just
simply how do we pay for it? How do we
find the time to do it? How do we
develop the skill set? So, we've got a
few techniques to do that. Firstly, if
you're working with influencers, you
just see you're you're sort of
effectively outsourcing a lot of that
creation process. So, that's the first
thing I'd recommend. The second thing is
that when you've got something that
works, when you've got a video ad that
works, a way to get a lot more out of it
as opposed to having to create a load
more stuff or pay for UGC influencer
style content to be created again, is to
use that same ad, but just add in a
number of different hooks. Let's say
it's a 45se secondond ad. You could have
the same 42 seconds across 10 different
ads, but the first 3 seconds be
different. So when you're working with
influencers, you just be like, "Right,
just record that again with a different
intro line and do that five with these
five different intro lines. Please
record that again in five different
locations." And the location could be as
simple as record one with this way so
it's got this background. Turn the
camera around. Record it this way so
it's got that background. It's just so
that it visually looks different. 95 90
plus% of people are not going to make it
past those first three seconds. So, when
it comes to overcoming ad fatigue, if
they've never seen those other 42
seconds with the original hook, if you
just change out the hook and put that in
front of people, that overcomes ad
fatigue. That does the job. That gets
past the, "Oh, I've seen this before"
filter. Let me scroll past. A really
easy way to take one ad that's working
really well and creates 10 more versions
of it that you can run for 10 times as
long. And this is exactly the sort of
thing that we teach you how to do in
detail as part of my mentorship program.
If you haven't heard about my mentorship
program before, here's what it contains.
exclusive content and material that you
won't see anywhere else. At onetoone
coaching, you literally have access via
Slack to someone within my team that you
can message anytime, ask any questions
you got, get feedback, get improvements
to your campaigns, recommendations, add
account audits, all that sort of stuff.
Someone available, me or one of my team
members on a live call 9 to 10 hours per
day across different time zones. We have
people in my mentorship program AC all
across the world. So, we've got uh
availability for calls across different
time zones to make it easy. So again,
you can jump on and be like, "I'm
struggling with tracking. I'm struggling
with attribution. Can you just jump on
with me? Let's do a screen share and get
this worked out." Basically, everything
you need to get the best Facebook ad
results possible. If that sounds
interesting, there is a link in the
video description below, click on that,
come through to website, book in a free,
no obligation call to find out more.
Hopefully, we get a chance to work
together. Play number three is budget
and scaling. So, I'd always recommend
that you start small, especially if you
don't know whether or not something will
work, either a new product or a new
offer, or maybe you're just new to the
platform in general. Start small. Start
with a budget that you could afford to
lose if it doesn't work out. Then once
you've tweaked, you've worked it out,
you've tested a few different things,
and you've got something that's
producing a positive return on ad spend,
something that you're happy with, then
look to scale it. Much better to do it
that way round than going the other way
and potentially losing too much money
whilst you're in that testing phase.
When you do scale, I'd recommend you
scale existing campaigns as opposed to
creating new ones. And when you scale
your budget, it's important you don't
just increase the budget. Be aware that
when you're spending more, your ads are
going to be put in front of people more
often. They're also going to be put in
front of more people. Therefore, you
also need to scale with creatives. So,
if you've got one ad that's performing
really well, if you try and 10x the
budget, it's unlikely that ad is going
to perform as well to 10 times as many
people for an extended period of time.
You're going to need to introduce new
creatives that can also do some of the
heavy lifting, produce leads and sales
as well. Play number four is data and
attribution. So, at a minimum, I'd
recommend that you get conversions API
and the Metapixel installed and make
sure they are both sending accurate
conversions back into your ad account. I
get a lot of questions, which one's
better? No, no, it's not a it's not a
either or when it comes to the pixel or
Cappy. You want both set up and
installed. Meta's AI needs accurate
data. They need to know who's
converting, what a conversion looks
like, how valuable is that conversion,
all that information in order for your
campaigns to optimize properly. And
because AI is doing more and more of the
targeting, of the optimization, working
out how many impressions does someone
need to purchase, um, how old does
someone need to be for them to be likely
to be really interested in, where do
they need to be located, all those
various data points. Meta needs accurate
data. They need to know who is actually
taking the action that you want people
to take um, from your advertising. Like,
this sounds a bit boring, sounds like an
afterthought. It absolutely isn't. And
one of the things that you learn very
quickly in this industry if you work
with really high spenders like
businesses that might be spending eight
figures a year for example on their meta
ad campaigns is that they obsess over
data and their accuracy because they
know that if they can improve their data
accuracy and improve the inputs the
meta's AI has by even 5% that might make
a huge difference to the results um that
they're able to get. And if you can
improve the data inputs by 5%, it might
give you a 25% improvement in return on
ad spend. That might allow you to spend
twice as much profitably. That might
allow you to g gather up that much more
market share. Um, really really
important. I talk about this a lot. I
don't want you to underestimate this and
I just see advertisers do that again and
again, which is why I'm sort of
hammering this uh this point. Also
important to get external data uploaded
to your meta ad account. Meta doesn't
have visibility over all your warm
audiences. Email lists, particularly
people who've interacted with the
business a while ago, longer than the
time frames that Meta is going to be
able to track via the pixel, for
example, longer than than 180 days. Uh
customer lists, any external sources of
data you think, okay, that's not on
Facebook, that's not on Instagram, Meta
won't already have that info. Get it
uploaded into your ad account. Um I've
got videos on how to do all that sort of
stuff you can find on my channel. You
also need to then segment out and let
Meta know who is who, right? So, who is
your engaged audience? Who are your
existing customers? And then obviously
everyone left over um is called. I've
done another specific video on
segmenting that out. We can show um on
screen as I'm talking about it how what
that looks like that section, but you
can go and check out that video as well
to uh set that up for your ad account.
And then for the best data tracking and
accuracy, I'd recommend you use Hyros.
Hyro is the best tracking and
attribution software for meta ads. It's
a software all the big players in this
industry use, including myself. I use it
to track results for my own ads as well
as all my organic results as well. So,
if someone books a call for our done for
you services, for example, I can see
exactly where that person came from with
a lot of accuracy. That allows me to
make better decisions for my marketing
and my business. Hyro has been able to
track that from our ad spend in this
campaign, we've generated £96,000,
but £58,000 of that was not reported by
Meta. So, if I was just looking at my
data within my meta ad account, I might
come to the conclusion that this
campaign is doing okay. But in reality,
this campaign is doing a lot lot better.
Now this is a relatively extreme example
because of the nature of our business.
So most of our products services have
recurring billing elements. Meta might
be able to see what we make initially
from our ad spend on that initial
transaction but not those subsequent
payments. That's why it it shows the
importance here of being able to
accurately see what we actually get from
our ad spend in order to be able to make
better decisions and optimize correctly.
So if you want to improve the
performance of your ad campaigns without
having to touch your ads, go ahead and
sign up to Hyros. There is a link in the
video description. Plane number five is
measurement and optimization. So you
should be making most of your
optimization decisions around return on
ad spend or cost per conversion. If you
can't measure return on ad spend or if
all your conversions are equally
valuable at the point of the conversion
um being generated. And I'd really
encourage you to not get lost in the
weeds on vanity metrics like
click-through rate, engagement.
Sometimes they will correlate with your
return on ad spend or your cost per
conversion. Not always. And there are
many scenarios where a higher CTR ad led
to a worse return on ad spend or ad that
seems to get lots of engagement maybe
because it's a bit clickbaity or a bit
engagement baity but does it actually
translate to leads and sales? No, it
doesn't matter then. Really focus in on
those two metrics. Now there is some
nuance to that and and a new development
that we're seeing when it comes to meta
advertising and that's actually some
recommendations that have come out of
meta and we've seen this within ad
accounts a lot. If you've ever had a
scenario where you say you've got five
ads within an ad set and one ad is
producing a much better return on ad
spend than the other four. So you think,
"Okay, great. I'll turn the other four
off. I'll leave the one on that's doing
well." And then all of a sudden, as soon
as you do that, that one ad that had
previously been getting a great return
on ad spend, the results fall off, like
really significantly get worse. You
think, well, why is that happening?
Well, Met have come out and explained
that. They will now take ads within one
adset within the same adset and they
will use them not always but sometimes
in a funnel structure. So they might be
using some ads as a topfunnel ad. That's
what they put in front of people
initially and then they use other ads
within that adset to effectively
retarget and get the conversion. Now
when Meta does that, the ad they're
using as topfunnel uh won't look very
good from a return on ad spend
standpoint. Whereas the ad that's using
to get the conversion, that will look
great from return on ad spend. And
that's why when you turn off those other
ads, you're not using you're not getting
the advantage of those sort of top
offunnel type uh experience and
therefore the other ad isn't performing
as well. So whilst you want to use
return on ad spend, cost per conversion
broadly to measure results and optimize,
is this campaign performing better than
this one? Is this offer performing
better than this one? Well, broadly,
yes, that's correct. Within an ad set,
be very careful turning off ads that
have a lower return on ad spend. Here's
what you should do instead. Turn off
ads. that Meta is not spending any money
on. That's their recommendation. If Meta
is continuing to spend money on it, even
if it has a worse return on ad spend
than the other ads, leave it on because
Meta is probably using that in a funnel
structure. If Meta doesn't feel like
that ad's producing great results or not
contributing to the the customer
journey, they'll stop spending money on
it. When Meta stops spending money on an
ad, that's when you want to turn it off
and introduce new ads uh to try and
improve performance, learn from the ones
that you can see are doing well, looking
at the data, and introduce those. So,
it's quite a an interesting shift. It
does make optimization a little bit more
difficult than just looking at rowass
and turning things off and and going
about it that way. But it totally makes
sense when you think about how smart
Meta's optimization process is that they
can now take people and go, "Right,
we'll show them this ad first and this
one." And here's the extra crazy part
and where we're going with this, and
this will become even even more clear.
They're not going to do the same thing
with everyone in your audience. Some
people might have this ad, then this ad,
then this ad, then this one that gets a
conversion. Other people might be able
to go straight to that ad and put that
one that converts well in front of them
and get them to convert. Meta's going to
be able to work that out. That's why we
want to give meta control over the
optimization process and put that into
the one ad set, maybe even within the
one campaign as opposed to having things
segmented out and being like, right,
they'll see this ad and they'll see this
ad, they'll see this ad. Because if you
set things up manually that way, you're
forcing everyone to go through the same
process. And meta can work out. Some
people need that, other people don't.
Much better to go directly for the sale.
If you then go through that process
again and again, introduce new ads. Hm.
Okay, meta is spending on this one and
this one, but not these other two,
right? Turn those off. Okay, these ones
are doing better. Right, this one's got
a really good hook. Let's create some
other ads with a similar hook. Or let's
recreate that ad with different hooks.
Let's get that in there. And if you keep
doing that again and again and again,
you'd be amazed by the improvement in
results. You can't often see it in the
short run. It's a bit like going to the
gym working out, right? No one ever
noticed any muscle gain from one
workout. you do it consistently over
time and you can get to a significantly
better place than you currently are.
Absolutely the same happens with your
meta ads. And play number six, and this
might be the most important, is to go
beyond the buttons. So getting
everything set up right within your
Facebook ad account is of course
important. And the settings and the
things that you change, they make a
difference to your results. But just
doing that alone is not enough to get
fantastic results. The businesses that
produce exceptional results, they always
have something else extra. They always
have a competitive advantage that's not
just within the ad account. They have a
brand that is much stronger and more
powerful than their competition. They
have a superior product, a superior
offer. Many different ways that you can
go about doing that, but just know that
if you want incredible results, you have
to have something that goes beyond the
buttons. Our ads, for example, they
produce a silly high return on ad spend.
And that's because I have a personal
brand. I have more than a million
followers. I've got 25 plus million
views on YouTube. So there's probably
what three, four, maybe 5 million meta
advertisers that might at least
recognize my face a little bit. So when
we put ads out into the world and that
that recognition is there, of course,
some will recognize me much more than
others. They are far more likely to pay
attention to the ad, far more likely to
click, far more likely to go, "Oh, we'll
work with them. I've checked out his
content. I know what he knows what he's
talking about. I know they're good.
Yeah, I'm going to join the mentorship
program, etc., etc." Right? It doesn't
have to be a personal brand. There are
other ways to do it, but you have to
find a way to have something better than
your competition, not just get
everything right within your ad account.
And if you want a more advanced tactic
that I didn't cover here, then you
should check out my video on value
rules. Value rules allow you to target
exactly who you want, not in the way
that you're thinking. Very different
from traditional meta ads targeting. A
very clever new feature. We're
experimenting with it a lot right now.
Really excited about it. If you don't
know how it works, you haven't had a
play, definitely check this
