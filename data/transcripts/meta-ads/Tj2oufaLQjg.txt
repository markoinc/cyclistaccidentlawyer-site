# The Creative Process I Use To Make Winning Meta Ads

# Category: meta-ads

I have an ad creative process that I
think almost every brand should be using
in some way to generate ads that sell
products for their brands. And I'm going
to tell it to you right now. I think it
will really help you by turning the ad
creative process less into a blank slate
try and find anything that will work and
more into something repeatable and
narrowed down and replicable for your
brand to create winning ads all the
time. Here
is the core idea that I want to get
across in this shorter episode today.
Okay. The core idea is that many brands
approach ad creative with way too broad
of possibilities anytime they sit down
to make ads, right? They they they have
way too broad of possibilities of what
they are trying to accomplish with their
ads. And you can get a lot farther a lot
faster by getting really good at a
narrower bunch of ad formats and styles.
Getting really awesome at changing the
messaging within those formats and
styles and changing the visuals of
course, but really nailing those formats
and styles and then repeatedly doing
that over and over and over again. So at
HF Growth, like what we do, right, is we
are kind of constantly on the hunt for
replicable ad formats. You know, like
there's just a million ads that all
kinds of brands are doing all the time.
And I see them and I think that's great,
but like I don't want to just be like
every time a growth strategist or
creative strategist at AJF Growth is
making ads for a client, I don't want
them to go and think like, hm, what kind
of ads should I make today? Instead,
they narrow in on the message because
the message is always the thing that
matters most. And we do a bunch of work
to make sure we focus on generating high
quality messages that sell products that
we know are resonating with customers.
And then we think, well, what is the
best packaging for that message for me
to make as much of that as possible? And
the sweet spot of ad creation is anytime
you can generate ads that cost the least
money to make at the production level,
that take cost the least time to make at
the production level as well, and that
have the highest impact. That combo of
low time cost, low dollar cost, right?
And again, production costs get
expensive. somebody has to pick up a
really nice camera and go shoot
something amazing or hire a really
really good creator or whatever. Those
kinds of things. And then at the same
time, it can be really effective in a
theoretical world where you're able to
generate ads all the time that have
those attributes. High performing, low
cost, lowc cost to make, fast to make,
and of course, they like represent your
brand well. And by the way, I would
never skimp on that. Like I think the
creative you make ought to represent the
brand well. If you can hit those things
at the same time, you have a playbook
there for creating replicable ads. So
what then you must go do is look for ads
that check those boxes and treat then
your ad creative process like a supply
chain. This is the reason why I think by
the way that AJF Growth is really really
good at making ad creative. We are not
great at making every kind of ad that
could possibly be made in the world and
I'm okay with that. There's lots of ad
formats that I see from other brands
that AJF Growth is not going to make for
our clients. We're just not. And it's
not because we don't think they work or
something like that. because we haven't
developed particular expertise in those
styles to be able to generate them at
scale relative to their performance
impact at scale effectively. And that's
okay with me. And this is the thing you
have to do in this process. You have to
become okay with the idea that there's
sort of like a weird ad creative FOMO
that happens where brands like see all
kinds of creative that's out there and
go, we got to make stuff like that. And
what I would say is like resist that
FOMO. Instead, become okay with the idea
that you are not going to make every ad
type. There are lots of ads that you're
going to see that you're going to think
are cool and inspirational and you're
going to be impressed by, but that
you'll never actually make. And what
we're doing all the time basically is
we're on the hunt for more formats, more
templates, more styles that can look and
feel and sound a little different than
things that we've made in the past and
ideally very different because we want
as much variation within all this as
possible. Okay? And yet we look at it
and say, "Oh, we can replicate that ad
and we can replicate it at scale over
and over and over again so that I can go
to a client and say, "Here's a format
that we think works. I'm going to make a
hundred ads in these formats." Now, now
listen, I'm not saying make iterations.
I don't think iterations are a good
idea. I think a great ad format is
something that you can make where it
changes all the time. Like anybody who's
ever made a I'll give you a simple
example, right? the post-it note ad. We
don't really make many of these anymore,
but the post-it note ad, you could
actually take that idea of a post-it
note ad and do it a million different
ways and it would look really different,
right? You could take the actual post-it
note, but the magic of the Post-it note
ad might be the bright color of the
Post-it note sticking out on a feed, but
I think it's probably mostly just the
way that like the text is written into
the image itself, right? So, we call
this a text and context ad. The copy is
not overlaid on top of an image. It's
actually in the image and you take a
picture of the of the image with copy on
it. Well, you could do that with a
million things. You could put it on a
letterboard. You can go write it on
chalk. You can go walk down to the beach
and write out your ad in the sand. Hire
someone to do skywriting. Now, that
would probably be very expensive, okay?
It'd be very hard to do very well, but
you know, you could make a banner. You
could make a poster, etc. All of those
things would be within the same format,
which is like text and context. There's
a there's copy in the ad, and you could
make a million variations of that, and
you could get really really good at
making that ad, right? We do this with
certain like long form explainer
formats. Okay? Now, this is something
that takes a little more time, right? We
we take the long form explainer ad and
we make a million variations of it and
we say like okay there's like there's so
many storytelling frameworks we can use
for this explainer where all the time
we're thinking the same way hook first
body and education second validation
after that guarantee offer those kinds
of things all make sense in this ad
format and you organize the information
that way but you could actually do a lot
of different things for how to do that.
You could do the founder ad, you can do
an influencer version of that ad. You
can do the version of that ad where
there's actually no talking head at all.
It's just entirely VO, right? Whether
that's AI VO or or an actual human
recording the VO and you can change a
story. You can do myth versus truth and
you can do a listical five reasons why.
This is the best product ever, right?
And maybe the five reasons why becomes
the hook. You could do the very
straightforward product version. This is
the X. This is the product. This is
product from brand and here's why it's
great. Okay? There's a million of those
formats. What we look for is how do we
take those, identify them, and then
replicate them as much as we possibly
can. And then all the time we are on the
hunt, like I said, we're looking in the
wild on social media feeds and on brands
that we like and things like that for
formats that we say we can replicate
that, we can do that and add it to our
list. And the net result of that is that
our ad creative approach actually in
some ways doesn't look that varied. We
have a relatively constrained library of
ad formats that we work from. It isn't
that huge, but within that, we're now so
good at those ad types that we are
repeatedly seeing our brands have newer
ads that we make within those formats
that are winners over and over and over
again. And we look at that and say, we
can make that ad. And so we can make it
for all of our clients. And of course,
some ad formats and some styles and some
messages, whatever, work better for some
than others, right? that the three
minute long form explainer works better
for a brand that has a lot that they
need to explain about their product and
has deep details about it. Okay, real
problem solutionoriented brands whereas
maybe something much shorter and simpler
with just a bunch of text on screen or
even just just you know really product
focused imagery works better for a
fashion brand or something like that.
Okay, there's there's all kinds of
things in between but that basic idea of
pursuing a bunch of different a number
of different formats and getting great
at them is what I want you to So here
here's like the really practical
application for you right now. If you
are thinking about ad format, ads that
you want to make for your brands, start
looking for brands that you can make for
ads that you can make relatively quickly
and easily and simply and templatize
them. Library them somewhere, right?
Create a library of them somewhere and
start figuring out how to replicate
those over and over. And at some point,
here's what you are going to tell
yourself. I promise you, you're going to
tell yourself, "We're not creating
enough variation. These are boring."
Whatever. That's the FOMO voice coming
in until it stops performing. Resist the
FOMO voice. Tell it to go away because
it is not helping you do the thing you
are trying to do, which is sell more
products, generate more interest in your
brand, generate really clicks to your
brand for people to have deeper
experiences with your brand. This is one
of those episodes that I really have
aimed in my head at disciplined
operators thinking intelligently about
their whole P&L. Not getting caught up
in hype about what they see out there,
but instead thinking about how do we
bring real rigor and discipline and
process to everything we do. It's the
kind of operator for whom rich panel is
a great fit. If you're still using
Gorgeous, if you're still using Zenesk,
what are you doing? Go jump on a call
with Rich Panel. Rich Panel guarantees
that they can save you 30% on your
customer service help desk software
bill. And so that's alone a reason to
take the call, especially at this time
of year when things have maybe slowed
down, cooled down a little bit. Go talk
with them and see are they the right fit
for your customer service help desk
software. They probably are because Rich
Panel was built AI first from the ground
up services brands of all sizes. So they
have nine figure clients like
Ridgewallet all the way down to like
brands just starting. That's the
customer service help desk software that
I'm going to be using. Multiple of my
clients in the 8 figureure space have
used rich panel and have seen them be a
great fit for them. They also see an
average of a 30% reduction in tickets,
customer service tickets for people who
switch over to them from gorgeous or
from Zenesk. And so it's just really
really good software built to scale with
you at an affordable price and that is
the reason you should do it. They can
also transfer you over from different
software to them in two weeks or less.
They know you don't have time to waste
on this. Go get on a call. See how fast.
See how easy it is. See how good the
software is. Take a tour of it yourself.
See the AI uh agent.
Now, this is the thing. Some people are
going to object to this idea and say,
"What about artisanship in your brand?
What about real creativity? What about
creating a brand that's going to have a
lasting impact?" And my answer is for
most brands that actually doesn't
primarily and mostly happen at the ad
level. If you are comparing yourself to
Nike when you are thinking about your
ads and what Nike is trying to
accomplish with their ads, which is like
deep, you know, really great
storytelling that leaves this big impact
on you and something like that. Let me
just tell you something. You're not
Nike. Not only at the level of your
budget, which is a huge part of the
question, but with what you were trying
to accomplish with your advertising. you
operator of seven or eight figure
e-commerce brand are actually trying to
get somebody to click and buy your
products right now. Okay, that's what
you are trying to accomplish and that's
not what Nike is trying to accomplish.
And therefore, if I was running Nike, I
probably wouldn't run the kinds of ads
that I'm talking about right now. But
I'm not running Nike and neither are
you. And what your brand needs to do is
to think about how do I accomplish a
repeatable process for a high variety of
high quality ads at scale. Okay, that's
what you are trying to actually
accomplish and to sell products while
you do at a cost that makes sense while
keeping your opex low because at the end
of the day, a low opex with a high
performing ad account is the way that
you generate a bunch of profit for your
growing e-commerce business. Okay. Now,
as your brand grows, there's all kinds
of ways to add complexity to this. One
of my favorite ways to see brands do
this. One of the things that we actually
invite and love in our ad creative
process is when brands go and they start
bringing in multiple creative agencies
as they grow. And the reason I love this
and I actually I mean I recently had
just in fact this week just released an
episode with Jess Bachmann from
Fireteam. I joyfully and gladly promote
Jess and Fire Team on my podcast. They
are not a competitor to us despite that
we both offer some creative services. Do
you know why? It is because Jess's team
is awesome at making ads that we are bad
at. Okay? And I think we are awesome at
making ads that Jess's team is pretty
bad at. Or at least I haven't seen the
evidence that he's good at it. Maybe
maybe he would be able to show me
otherwise. Okay? And that to me is
symbiotic. And that's the way that
creative agencies and ad agencies and
teams ought to be working, which is like
forget trying to be awesome at
everything. Instead, just like anybody
would tell you about almost any task in
business or in in life in general, get
really awesome at a few things. And when
it's time to get better at more things,
start bringing in other people who are
great at those. Don't feel like you have
to have every skill yourself. And so
larger brands, as they go, start making
larger investments with influencers and
creators and all these. And that's the
way to create more variation. But it's
sequencing, right? Earlier on in your
story, you don't need to go do all of
that stuff. That's not what's going to
get you where you're going. And not just
earlier on, but even in the sort of
middle phases of things, start
generating a bunch of creative that
works, that you can do at scale, and
that you get really, really good at.
That's again what we do for brands. If
you are trying to generate the kind of
creative I'm talking about in this
episode, you should do it with my
friends at Behindthescenes Studio.
BTSstudio.co
is the place to go. Well, Behind the
Scenes Studio is the team based in the
Philippines that I use for my creative
to be an extension of my team. So that
as I am generating creative strategy for
my clients, the the team at BTS Studio
is doing the design and edit work.
They're really built as an agency,
design and video editing agency,
creative agency, specifically for
e-commerce, specifically for meta ads.
So they're not just like an all-purpose
thing. They really have dialed in on how
do we generate high quality,
high-erforming, highly varied meta ads
at scale. We're really following a lot
of the Andrew Ferris playbook because we
work so closely handinhand with them. So
if you are a brand that needs an
extension of your creative team,
extension of creative resources with a
real focus on meta that is reasonably
priced and can generate a bunch of high
performing high-quality creative for you
as you are trying to grow. You should go
to behindthescenes studio and check them
out. Go to btsstudio.co
btsstudio.co
and get on a call. See if they're the
right fit for you and for what they
offer and for what you need.
btsstudio.co. huge fan of AC and her
team over there. Go check them out. One
of the things I think that we offer a
lot of brands is an actual creative
methodology that is just like like most
brands just don't have it. They just
don't have a way of actually thinking
about replicating creative over and
over. They they're instead, like I said,
they're just sort of grabbing whatever
works all the time. So then to come back
to my earlier question, where does
artisanship come in in this? And where
does creativity and making a brand
that's going to have a lasting impact?
Where does all that come in? Well, it
comes in at other parts of the business
among other things. It comes into the
level of your product. It comes in at
the level of your organic social feed,
which is more of an owned channel where
there's you're trying to sell a little
bit less and you are doing a little more
storytelling. Comes at the level of a
great packaging and unboxing experience.
It comes at the level of your website
and your photography and these kinds of
things. Okay? But at the end of the day,
what the point of the ad is is to get
people to all of that stuff. And if you
can do that while generating really,
really creative stuff or something like
that, then awesome. But in general,
that's just not what most brands
actually need in order to accomplish.
I'm not saying your creative should be
bad. Your creative should be good. Like
this is the point. The point is for your
creative to be good, you ought to lean
on formats that you can execute
excellently over and over again. And
getting good requires repetitions and it
requires doing things well over a long
period of time. This again is where that
creative supply chain concept comes in.
The more you make something, the more
you do it, the more you can hone in on
what makes it good. And so for us, what
we look for to so that we do two things,
right? So first we say we don't mind.
First of all, we're going to resist
FOMO. If a lot of our creative is within
a semi-narrow band of formats, and it's
not that narrow, right? We make plenty
of variation in our formats. We're okay
with that. As long as it sells product,
we're okay with it. Okay? So, there's
that. But secondly, the other answer to
that is not to just go, ah, we got to
make more different stuff. It's to say
it's to thoughtfully look around and
say, what other kinds of creative can we
now add to our template and add to our
library? And one of the things I'm sort
of optimistic about for the next couple
years of AJF growth is more time
building out and adding to creative
frameworks and libraries and templates
so that we can have ever expanding types
of creative all the time. One thing
we've actually found AI to be very very
good at is to have access to all of that
creative templating and all that
creative library and then to actually
recommend different styles and formats
relative to the message. Like for
example, I did some new year new you
content for a client recently. We have a
storytelling framework that we call the
time traveler warning. And the idea is
like it's a sort of storytelling format
for long form explainers where we say
you're going to be one of two people in
the next six months or whatever or in
the next year. Okay? And our uh AI
coowwriter was really good at saying,
"Oh, you're making new year, new you
content. That's the message. Why don't
you try it with the time traveler
warning storytelling framework, which
maybe you wouldn't have thought of
otherwise, but of course it makes sense.
Hey, you're going to be one of two
people in March. you're gonna be the
kind of person who actually followed
through on their resolutions this year
and actually became the kind of person
they wanted or you're gonna have another
year where you're the same old self and
whatever you get the idea and AI is
really really good at this. So again
building detail into that process so
that you get really good at executing
these kinds of things building that
library out so that you have a really
good set of things and finding ways to
access and work within and build process
on that is the kind of thing I'm talking
about. The point is build less big ideas
and instead get better at a narrow band.
Then expand the band of ideas over time
with real focus to do that. Always
within brand standards, always keeping a
high quality, always attempting to
create variety within those formats,
which is actually more doable than you
think. That's the way that you can
actually go forward this year as you
pursue more ad creative. As your brand
grows and you have more money to invest,
start thinking about, okay, now how do I
use creators or influencers or other
agencies to expand my creative
formatting? But for now, don't worry
about it. You don't need to do that too
much. Resist the FOMO of what other
brands that you like are doing. Instead,
get really good at what you're doing now
and get and replicate them as often as
you possibly can.
This is one of those observations that
was sort of part of my end of the year
reflections because I was thinking so
much about this kind of question about
FOMO and what is driving brands to make
sub-optimal decisions. And I think
creative is one of those things like
that as I said in this episode. So, if
you resonate with this, I'd love to hear
