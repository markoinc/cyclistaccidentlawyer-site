# Category: meta-ads

I've spent more than $200 million on
Facebook ads over the past 12 years,
working with more than 3,000 clients in
just about every industry you can think
of. And in this video, I'm going to walk
you through the entire process of
creating a Facebook ad campaign and an
Instagram ad campaign from [music]
scratch. So, if you've never created a
Facebook ad before, or if you have, but
you're not 100% sure that you set up
everything correctly, this is the exact
video you need because I'm going to show
you every single step and setting you
need to get right. So before we dive
into the fun stuff and start putting our
ad campaign together, we first need to
get our account structure sorted. And
what I mean by that is creating a meta
business manager account because your
business manager account is what holds
all your meta ad assets. So things like
your ad account, your Facebook page,
your Instagram profile. To do that, you
want to come through to this page, which
is business.fas.com.
Now, in order to set one of these up,
you will need to be logged into your
Facebook profile on the browser that
you're using. Uh the process is really
straightforward. Unfortunately, I can't
demonstrate it because we already have
tons of accounts. But if you just come
through to this page, make sure you're
logged into your Facebook profile, go
through the process. Meta is just going
to ask for a few simple bits of
information about your business. Just
very simple, very straightforward to go
through. Once you've done that, you'll
be taken through to your Meta business
suite. And this is what it looks like.
Although yours might look different if
you haven't got, you know, the things
like your Facebook page and your
Instagram profile added as I have here.
The meta business suite is a really
useful tool, something to know about for
later on. You've got things like inbox
where [clears throat] you can manage
comments on your Facebook and Instagram
ads. You can respond or delete them,
etc. You've got lead center where you
can manage the leads you generate uh via
instant forms. More about that later on.
You've got creator marketplace where you
can find creators and influencers to
help promote your products and services.
Lots of useful stuff in here. But what
we want to do is go ahead and click on
settings because we need to finish
setting up that structure that I talked
about earlier. And it's this settings
page where we can add in those meta ad
assets that I referred to earlier. So,
make sure we get the your Facebook page
in your business manager account. Same
with Instagram account, etc., etc.,
right? And by the way, yours might look
a little bit different because you're
not probably going to have more than 100
people added to your business manager
account and more than a thousand ad
accounts. We literally have more than a
thousand ad accounts in our business
manager. Um, but that's absolutely fine.
You'll still be able to follow along
with the process. So, let's start with
the Facebook page. I'm going to go here
and go over to pages and I'm going to
click on this ad down here. So, we've
got a few different options, right?
We've got add an existing Facebook page.
So, if you already have a Facebook page,
something you're definitely going to
want and need to run ads um on Facebook,
right? Then what you want to do is move
that page over into this business
manager account, you can request access
to request shared access to a Facebook
page. So, if it's linked with another
business manager account for some
reason, maybe you've had an agency
working on some stuff for you, but you
also want to get it out in here, then
you can go with app or you can just go
ahead and create a new Facebook page if
you haven't got one and need to do so. I
think most of you are going to be adding
an existing Facebook page. So, let's
demonstrate that. So, if I go ahead and
click on that, it's very, very simple.
You just go ahead and add in the
Facebook page name or the URL. So, you
just want to go ahead and paste the URL
to your Facebook page in here, as I've
done just there. Once I select this,
it's going to say it page is already in
your business portfolio, so I can't go
through the rest of the process, but
it's very straightforward. You just go
ahead and click next. Um, don't worry
about review people. We'll cover that in
a minute. And then you just request
approval. So, you're basically sending
an approval to whoever the admins are of
that Facebook page already. That's
probably you. That's probably your
Facebook profile. You probably get a
notification and an email. You could
just go ahead and approve and then that
page will be moved into this business
manager and you've taken care of that.
Okay. So, let's go ahead and do
Instagram accounts next. Same process.
We go ahead and click on add. Oh, a
quick warning about adding an Instagram
account in here. Only Instagram
professional accounts can be added to a
business portfolio. If you add a
personal account, it will be switched to
professional. You want a professional
Instagram account for your business
anyway. If you're going to be running
ads and operating as a business, that's
fine. So once you add it in, it'll be
switched. No problem. You've got to
agree to the terms and then you go ahead
and click on add Instagram account. And
then this process is really
straightforward, right? So you just need
to log into your Instagram account.
Again, if I try and do this, it's going
to say it's already added in there. And
then you just provide access by logging
in. You don't even then need to approve
um via a notification on the other end.
So really straightforward just to go
through that. Let's go ahead and cancel.
Okay. Next, let's do your ad account. So
we've come into ad accounts. If we go
ahead and click on add. Again, we've got
a number of different options. So you
can create a new ad account. If you've
never run an ad before, you've never
boosted a post, uh, then you probably
don't have an ad account. You can go
ahead and create one. You just want to
go ahead and click on create an ad
account and then enter in the
information that Meta asks for. Ad
account names. Just put your business
name in there. Select your right time
zone. Select your right currency. Make
sure you get these right. If you don't,
uh, very difficult to change them uh,
later on. So, just make sure, you know,
this is defaulted to US dollars, but I'm
in the UK, so most likely I'm going to
want to change that to GBP to pounds.
But just go through the process. So, I'm
not going to go through it. Like I
explained for previously, we've already
got plenty plenty of ad accounts, but go
through the process. Um, very
straightforward. And then your ad
account will be created. If you already
have one, like I said, if you've ever
boosted a post, you ever run an ad, you
do have an ad account. And what you want
to do is add an existing ad account. So,
you click click on this and you just add
in your ad account ID. You paste that in
there. Click confirm. Again, a
notification will be sent to whoever
currently owns that ad account, and you
need to then approve that. Very similar
process to the Facebook page. I will
show you in a minute once we get into
the ad account itself and start creating
the campaign where to find find your ad
account ID in case you're unfamiliar
with that process. So those are the
three that you really need to get added
in. You need your Instagram account,
your Facebook page and your ad account.
There are other stuff you can look to
add in WhatsApp accounts and other
business assets, data sources, all
sorts. But that's really what you need
to get started. And you'll you'll see as
we go through this process. I really
want to make getting your first Facebook
and Instagram ad campaigns up and
running as easy as possible. We're not
going to mess with all the various
advanced settings and features that
complicates the process and becomes a
barrier entry. So, let's keep it simple.
We can add complexity later on. The
other thing quick thing I want to
mention is around people. Um, this might
not be important for you right now if
you're only the one who's going to be
managing your uh Facebook and Instagram
ads, the only one involved in that
process, but at some point you might
want other people to be involved. So,
let me just quickly show you how this
works. If I go ahead and click on invite
people, you then just need the email
address that's associated with their uh
Facebook profile. You can add that in
there and then send them the invite.
Again, they'll receive a notification
they need to accept it. And then you can
assign access. I won't go through that
process because I can demonstrate it um
elsewhere. And then once you've got
someone added like I've got here, you
can go ahead and click assign assets.
And you can say, look, I want them to
have access, for example, to this
Facebook page and I want them to be able
to run ads or or deal with content or
have full control over absolutely
everything. Um, so you can give people
different levels of access so they can
work on the things they need to be able
to work on without having to give them
access to um everything. So, it's quite
a quite a neat solution to be able to do
this. You want to do that process with
yourself, with your own profile. Make
sure you get yourself added and give
yourself the various assets um that
you've added in here. Facebook page,
Instagram account, um ad account. Okay,
so hopefully that wasn't too
complicated. That's our structure set
up. What we now need to do is go ahead
and dive in and actually create our ad
campaign. So, you can create ad
campaigns from within the Meta Business
Suite, but I'd recommend you do so from
within Ads Manager. So, if you go ahead
and click on these three little lines,
all tools, you will see ads manager
here. And then if I click on this, you
got a few different options. I want you
to come through to the campaigns tab.
Um, if you go through to account
overview and think, hang on, this looks
very different to everything Ben
demonstrates, not just um in this video,
but potentially in my other videos, just
cuz I'm basically always in the
campaigns tab within Ads Manager. So,
now we get to the really interesting
part where we can start creating our
Facebook and Instagram ad campaign. Oh,
just quickly I mentioned around grabbing
your ad account ID earlier to be able to
move a an ad account an existing ad
account into your business manager
account and you can just grab that up
here right at the top. Um you'll see
that so you can come in and uh and paste
that in and get it moved over. So the
first thing to know about meta ad
campaigns about Facebook and Instagram
ad campaigns is that there are three
levels to a campaign. You've got the
campaign level and then within that
you've got adsets and then within adets
you've got ads. And each one of those
stages is responsible for different
things. um around what people see but
also who sees it, various settings,
budgets, etc., etc. We're going to go
through all of it, but that's the first
thing to understand that you can have,
for example, multiple adsets within one
campaign, multiple ads within one adset.
So, it's very much um that sort of
structure. So, we want to start by
creating a new campaign. So, make sure
you've got campaigns out of those three
selected and then go ahead and click on
this plus green create button. And there
are a couple of settings that we need to
choose right at the beginning because
whatever we select here will impact the
options available to us later on as we
go through the campaign creation
process. Don't worry about collaborative
ads. More of an advanced thing. We're
going to ignore that. Uh not for today.
Something I talk about in other videos
and you can move on to later on if
that's something that you want to do.
But two things we do need to talk about
are the buying types and the campaign
objective. So we've got two different
buying types. We've got auction and
we've got reservation. Auction is just
the cost of your Facebook and Instagram
ads is going to be determined by simple
market forces. Demand and supply. More
demand, higher cost, less demand, lower
cost. And that's demand from
advertisers, by the way. How many
advertisers there are, how much they're
willing to spend. Uh reservation, you
can actually guarantee a certain price,
often a lower price. And and the cost of
Facebook advertising is normally
measured in CPMs. So cost per thousand
impressions. So it's cheaper to use
reservation, but that's not the option
I'd recommend you use, which might sound
bizarre. Here's why. In order for Meta
to be able to guarantee that lower cost,
they are going to put your ads in front
of lower quality prospects or lower
quality ad placements. The better
quality ad impressions are usually seen
through auction and that's a big deal.
So, I'd recommend you go with auction.
Let's move on to campaign objective. So,
we've got six different options here and
they do different things. And your
campaign objective is really, really
important because it's going to inform
how Meta optimizes your campaign. So,
you're basically saying to Meta, "This
is what I want." And Meta's really
powerful machine learning and AI based
systems are going to optimize your ads,
work out who to advertise to, what time
a day, how often, all those things to
get you more of what you want. That's
why it's so important to get your
campaign objective set up correctly. So,
we've got awareness. Awareness is where
Meta will put your ads in front of
people that are most likely to remember
them. Put your ads in front of as many
people as possible. not an option I
typically recommend for beginners or for
businesses operating with a relatively
small Facebook and income ad budget
because it can be quite an easy way in
those scenarios to spend a bunch of
money and not really see anything back
for it. What we see with awareness is it
can work really well for larger
businesses with big budgets because
awareness takes time and it takes a lot
of ad impressions across a lot of people
over an extended period. Bigger
businesses have those budgets. Smaller
ones and beginners to to meta ads
typically don't. There is an exception
and that's if you sell a high ticket or
expertise-based service then you might
want to use my omnipresent content
strategy which typically does use
awareness. I'm not going to cover that
in this video. Just wanted to quickly
mention it and you'll be able to find a
video about my omnipresent content
strategy in on my channel. So if you
meet that criteria maybe go ahead and uh
and check that out. But otherwise for
most of you watching this I would say
leave awareness alone for now. Then
we've got traffic. traffic is designed
to optimize for as many link clicks as
possible or as many landing pages as
possible to get as many people from
Facebook and Instagram to your website.
Now, a lot of beginner Facebook and
Instagram advertisers use traffic. They
think, great, I'll send a load of
traffic to my website. I want as many
people as possible. I'll then generate
my leads, sales, etc. from those people.
It's not typically the best way to go,
though. If you do really want purchases
or you do really want leads that can go
on to use your services, there are
better options that we'll get to um in a
minute because Meta's optimization
system is very literal. So, if you say
to Meta, I want as many link clicks as
possible, Meta is very good at finding
people that are likely to click, but
those people don't necessarily go on to
convert. other campaign objectives and
options might be better at yes
generating a few less clicks to your
website but the people that do arrive
are far more likely to go ahead and take
the next action. Sometimes we are forced
to use the traffic objective if you
cannot optimize you cannot track a
purchase on your website or you cannot
track who becomes a lead. Let's say for
example you're sending traffic through
to a third party site where you can't
track the actions that people take once
they get there. Well then you may be
forced to use traffic. Engagement is
what it sounds like. A campaign
objective is going to optimize for
likes, comments, and video views.
Basically, just getting people to engage
with the ads themselves. There are use
cases for engagement, but I'm not going
to go into them here. Not something I
typically recommend most beginners use.
The vast majority of Facebook
advertising beginners want to use either
leads or sales. And I'll explain I'll
talk about both of those together. Um,
that's what we really want from a meta
ad campaign, particularly if we're
operating with a small budget,
particularly if we're getting started,
because you want to generate those
leads, generate those sales in the short
run to provide the profitability to be
able to reinvest and scale your
campaigns and your business. And that's
the whole point where we're running ads
in the first place, right? So, leads and
sales are much more direct response
marketing. Um, and if you select leads,
then Meta will optimize your campaign
for people who are likely to go on to
become a lead. If you select sales, Meta
will do likewise.
The decision between which one of these
two to use is what does your salesunnel
structure look like? If someone comes
through directly to your website and
makes a purchase, go with sales. Meta
can track that. You could set up so Meta
can track that quite accurately and then
you're good to go. If however people
book in a call with you or they sign up
for a free quote or something along
those lines, they don't actually check
out with you online, then go with leads
and you can optimize for that step. um
knowing that obviously then need to
convert those people whether it's via
phone call or email whatever whatever
your salesunnel structure um looks like.
Right? And then you've got app
promotion. If you've got an app
obviously the option to use if you don't
don't use it. You can use app promotion
not just for getting more people to
install your app but also for trying to
sell inapp events whether it's like an
inapp purchase for example as well. For
demonstration purposes in this video I'm
going to go ahead and select leads. But
what I'm about to talk about very much
applies to sales, which I think 90 plus
percent of you what going through this
video should be using either leads or
sales. So very much what we go through
from now on um is salespace. But the
example campaign that I'm going to use
is leads based. So we're going to use
that for demonstration purposes. If I go
ahead and click continue, there are a
few more things that we need to set at
the campaign level. Okay. So the very
first thing at the top is campaign name.
Um you just want to call this something
that is going to make sense to you when
you're reviewing the campaigns. we've
just got the one campaign. It's pretty
obvious. Once you've had an ad account
running for a few years and you've got
lots of different campaigns, you run
lots of different offers and promotions,
you want to label it up something that
uh that makes sense. I'm just going to
leave that as new leads campaign, but I
just wanted to to quickly note that.
Okay, so in these campaign details,
we've already talked about buying type.
We've already talked about campaign
objective. I'm not going to bother with
the show more options. Then we get into
budget. Okay, so we've got budget
strategy. The default selected here is
campaign budget, but we can select ads
set budget if we want. And to explain
the differences between the two, with
campaign budget, the budget is set at
the campaign level. Meaning that if you
have multiple adsets, budget will be
distributed to those adsets according to
performance. So if you've got adset A
that's performing much better than adset
B, adset A will get more of the budget.
However, what you can do instead is
select adset budget and say, "No, no, I
want to have manual control over how
much each adset gets from a budget
perspective." Then you can go ahead and
do that. In this instance, the campaign
I'm going to demonstrate is only going
to have one campaign and one adset. And
in that scenario, it doesn't make any
difference whether you set the budget at
the campaign level or the adset level.
So, I'm just going to leave that as a
default, but just wanted to explain the
options. If you've got multiple adsets,
um there might be something that you
want to change. You might be happy just
leaving it at a campaign budget,
allowing Meta to allocate budget
according to performance because if Meta
spends more of our budget on the best
performing elements, we get better
results, right? Then we've got this
budget option down here. The default is
daily budget. You can change to lifetime
budgets. I prefer daily budgets. With a
lifetime budget, you end up with a fixed
length campaign. So, let's say you want
to run a campaign for 7 days or 14 days.
You can go ahead and select lifetime
budget and then Meta is going to spend
your money to try and get you as many of
your result that you want, what you've
uh selected as your objective as
possible. But they're going to do that
over that time period. So, your spend
might be quite lumpy. You might spend
very little at the beginning, quite a
lot in the middle, very little at the
end, or it could be a different
combination. Whatever meta thinks will
produce the best results. Daily budgets
are a lot more flexible and a lot more
consistent. And if you want to run a
campaign longer, you don't want to after
the 7-day lifetime campaign, have to
create a new one and meta go back
through the learning phase and
everything like that. We'll talk about
more about that later on. Um, daily
budgets allows you to do that. You also
have more scalability. you can change
the budget with a daily budget campaign
more easily without running um into
issues. Okay. So, in terms of what to
start with, how much should you spend,
I've got some uh some guidelines around
that. What I recommend particularly
beginners do is they set a budget that
they could afford to lose. So, you you
wouldn't be in financial difficulties
either you or your business if you ran
the ad campaign, you spent this much
money on it, and it didn't work out.
Because it's a marketing campaign, there
are no guarantees. You may well need to
try a few different offers in your ads
in order to find one that lands. You may
need to test a few different ads to find
one that lands, right? So, there's no
guarantee it's going to work out uh
really well from day one. Obviously,
going through this video is really going
to help you and increase your your
chances of success there, but no
guarantees. So, let's be smart about
this. But on the other hand, you don't
want to spend a budget amount that is so
small that you don't care about it at
all. You don't want to be one of these
things where you set it up and just
think, "Ah, whatever. It's going to take
long in the background." You want to be
involved and engaged in the process. And
I find that there's often a sweet spot
where you could afford to lose that
money and it wouldn't be disastrous, but
it would sting a little. That's normally
a sweet spot where you're really
actively in there, but you've given
yourself time to be able to test and
experiment and work out um what can work
right there. So, I'm just going to leave
this as the default, but just that
that's going to vary massively depending
on the business. There's no right
amount, which is a question I get asked
a lot. For some businesses, that's going
to be $10 a day. For others, it's going
to be $5,000 a day. Like varying sizes
of businesses, massively different
budgets. What matters and what they can
afford to lose, very, very different.
Right? Then we've got campaign bid
strategy. Now, this is really important.
If I go ahead and click on this, you can
see this is says how will bid in ad
auctions. Highest volume is the default.
That's exactly what I want to go with
here because that will determine how
Meta optimizes the campaign. Basically,
we set this up as a leads campaign and
we want the highest volume of leads as
possible, right? There are other
options. We could add in a cost per
result goal or a bid cap to say I'm only
willing to pay a certain amount. Um, not
something I would recommend you mess
with as a beginner. So, I'm not going to
worry about the more settings or the AB
testing. Those are more advanced things
you may want to look into later on. I
have videos covering them all. But for
now, we want to make it as simple as
possible to get set up and and get
started to gain momentum. Then you can
look to make things more complicated. We
do need to talk about special ad
categories, though. So, special ad
categories, if your ads fall into any of
these categories, right? they're related
to financial products and services,
employment, housing, social social
issues, election or politics, then you
have to select that that's the case.
When you do that, it is going to impact
some of the options you have later on
through the campaign creation process.
So, for example, for a lot of these,
you're going to have limited targeting
options and have to rely more on meta to
be able to work out who to put your ads
in front of. It's a way of sort of
protecting user privacy and things along
those lines. Um, if you do fall within
one of these categories or you think you
might fall in one of these categories,
definitely select it. If you don't and
then you go ahead and run ads anyway, a
good chance not only your ads will be
rejected, but your whole ad account can
get disapproved, which can then be quite
difficult to overturn or you have to
create a new ad account. Not something
that you want to deal with. Most of you
won't have any of these as a as an
option for, you know, that you'll need
to select given what it is you're
advertising. But for those that do, make
sure you go ahead and select them. I'm
not going to there. I'm going to go
ahead and click next. Okay, so that's
the campaign level done. Now we move on
to the adset level where we've got a
bunch of other settings that we need to
decide and set things up. So the first
we need to choose here is the conversion
location. Where do we want these leads
to occur? Where do we want them to take
place? We've set this up as a a leads
campaign. Again, very similar process
for a sales campaign. Now the default
here is website and instant forms. So
website is pretty straightforward. It's
I want to generate leads via my website.
So send people from Facebook, from
Instagram to my website where they can
then uh book a call or fill out a
contact form. A few different types of
leads obviously where they can go ahead
and become a lead. Instant form is a
little bit different. That's where you
can click on an ad, say within Facebook
or Instagram, instead of going through
to your website, you are instead
presented with an instant form. A form
where people can provide their contact
information that then allows you as the
business to reach out to them and
hopefully progress that lead into a full
customer. And with this conversion
location selected, you can generate
leads either via your website or via
instant forms. And meta will test both,
see which performs best and then
allocate budget accordingly. They may
also predict for an individual user, is
this person more like to become a lead
via website or is this person more like
to become a lead via an instant form? So
different people might see different ads
or or different conversion locations go
through the process. For the purposes of
this video though and sort of getting
started with your Facebook and Instagram
ads and keeping things as simple as
possible, we talked about that being
important. get some results, gain
momentum, and then you can look to add
in more complicated things. I'm just
going to go ahead and select website
because having instant forms there as
well means you need to create an instant
form. That's a whole extra element as
part of the the campaign creation
process, but you probably already have a
website. You probably already have a
landing page uh that you can send people
to that may well want to be improved.
But like I said, let's let's make it as
easy as possible to get started and
reduce that barrier to entry. And also,
if you are running through this,
following along with this tutorial,
creating a sales campaign, you're an
e-commerce business, for example, well,
you're not going to have the instant
form option, and you're going to want to
be sending people through to your
website. So, we can all sort of follow
along. If I select website, and I think
that's a good option for a lot of
beginners. Now, if you don't have a
website and you want to get started
quickly and easily generating leads via
Facebook and Instagram, then you can
just go ahead and select instant forms
and just have that as an option and and
not need a website. Um but yeah, but I
think for most people they will already
have one most watching this video and
that's a good way to go. But you can
also see there are lots of different
ways to generate leads, right? You can
generate leads via messenger, uh via
Instagram, via WhatsApp calls, so people
can call your business. So depending on
your business where you are in the
world, for example, WhatsApp's a lot
more prevalent in certain parts of the
world than others. That might be a
really good way to go where you can
start a chat on WhatsApp and look to
generate leads that way. Um you might
want to have a play around with this and
think about for your market, for your
business, what what makes the most
sense. And you can always test multiple
options. Nothing wrong with that. In
fact, I actively encourage that sort of
thing as you can often find ways of
improving things when you do so. So once
we select our conversion location, this
case website, that is going to change
what options we have down here. The the
most important of which being
performance goal. So I talked earlier at
the campaign creation stage about how
important the campaign objective is in
getting that right. you can still mess
up a good campaign objective selection
with a bad performance goal because what
the campaign objective selection really
does is it determines which options you
have later on. The performance goal is
how Meta is going to optimize your
campaign. So let me click in here and we
can take a look at the options. Right?
So the default is maximize number of
conversions. But underneath leads goals
we also have maximize value of
conversions. Now, maximized number of
conversions is absolutely fine if you're
advertising the one service and when
someone becomes a lead, they look just
as valuable as anyone else who becomes a
lead. But if you're advertising multiple
services, then it might be that one
service, if someone goes on to convert,
they're worth $200 to your business.
Whereas with another service, if they go
on to convert, they're worth $5,000 to
your business. There's a massive
difference in the value of those two
leads depending on what they've said
they're interested in. If you go with
maximize value of conversions, then Meta
is going to not just try and get as many
conversions as possible, but optimize
and weight it in favor of the more
valuable conversions. In other words,
you might end up paying more in terms of
cost per lead, but that's a trade-off
you'd be happy to make if you got more
leads for the $5,000 service as opposed
to the the $200 service, right? So, this
really depends on your business which
one you go with. If you're just
advertising the one service within this
campaign, absolutely fine to go with
maximize number of conversions. But if
you've got differing services uh with
differing values, definitely go with
maximize value of conversions. Now, in
order to track that, you're going to
need to make sure that you've got all
the tracking set up properly. So, you're
going to need to have the meta pixel
installed and the values of each lead
being sent back to Meta. I've got a
video about Pixel Instation. You're
going to need that if you're sending
people to your website. Uh no matter
what, you're going to need to have the
pixel installed properly. Um and I've
also got videos on conversions API,
which is something else that's
recommended from a tracking standpoint.
So, you can check those out. um cuz
that's an important part of the the
setup of a campaign creation process of
getting started with Facebook and
Instagram ads if you are sending people
through to your website. Uh check out
those videos. But yeah, that's the
difference between those two. If you're
running a sales campaign, you have
basically the same options, but the
wording might be slightly different. And
in that scenario, let's say you're
e-commerce business, I would absolutely
recommend you go with the value option,
with the option that maximizes return on
ad spend or maximizes value because you
can always track differing values
because they go straight through your
website and purchase there and then. And
some people will spend a little bit when
they check out. Some people will spend a
lot when they check out. And it's really
important you get better to optimize for
the people that are more likely to spend
more when they come through to your to
your website. So definitely go the
wording might be slightly different in
terms of what these are called but
you'll see the same options right
between just get me as many sales as
possible versus get me the most value
overall as possible. So uh act in favor
of the higher value purchases the higher
value checkouts. Right in this instance
I'm just advertising the one service
with the leads being equally valuable
when they become a lead within this
campaign. So I'm going to go with
maximize number of conversions but just
wanted to talk through that option. Now,
what's really really important, this is
what I said a second ago around if you
get your performance goal wrong, you can
mess up your campaign um even if you've
selected the right campaign objective is
do not select one of these other goals.
So, don't say maximize number of landing
page views or link clicks. If you do
that, it's going to run just like a
traffic campaign and you get lots of
clicks, lots of landing page views,
probably not many leads, not many sales.
Don't go with daily unique reach. That's
going to run just like an awareness
campaign uh or maximize number of
impressions very similarly, right? So
you can sort of you can mess things up
by selecting one of these other goals.
Go with the leads goals or the sales
goals and you should be all good. Uh
data set. I already talked about the
pixel, but just double check to make
sure that yep, the pixel's installed.
This is an example ad accounts. We've
got example ad accounts pixel. Like I
said, has other videos you can check out
on those. And then we need to choose the
specific conversion event that we want
to optimize for. So we're saying to
Meta, look, get me as many conversions
of this conversion as possible. For
that, you're going to have to have the
pixel set up properly, but yes, we want
as many leads as possible. We could
change that to schedule or one of the
other options that um that we might want
to optimize for as part of our leads
campaign. You'll see a similar process
for a sales campaign where you can
optimize for purchases or you can
optimize for add to carts. My preference
would be to go for purchases provided
you're generating enough purchase for
meta to be able to learn. We know that
that process is important. If not, you
might need to go for a step that's
higher up um the salesunnel. Okay.
Anyway, moving on. Don't worry about
cost per result goal. Not something to
mess with. Don't worry about value rule
sets. We've got a value rule set preview
here, but this is very much, you know,
because I demonstrated this as an
example ad account in previous videos. I
have videos on value rules if you want
to check those out. Not something that
um beginners need to mess with. Neither
the show more options or the dynamic
creative. We get next down into the
budget and schedule. Now, we've already
talked about the budget being set at the
campaign level. We've talked through the
logic of how much you want to spend and
you want to go with daily budgets and
all that. Here we really just have now
the power to set a start and end date.
You might want to set an end date if it
just provides some sort of like mental
security that okay, this campaign is not
just going to run indefinitely and I'm
going to forget about end up spending
far more than I want. You can go and set
an end date. We're going to be in our
campaigns plenty enough where we just
don't need to worry about that. We're
managing them all the time and that sort
of thing. And again, I'm not going to
mess with show more settings here
either. Lots of advanced stuff that
we're scooting over, but I think that's
helpful when you're getting started.
Okay. Then we get down into the audience
section. And the audience section is all
about targeting. And targeting is
probably a thing that made well
originally it was just Facebook ads
famous. Uh but even as Instagram was
added, that's a thing that got marketers
and advertisers excited about the
platform is the ability to be able to
target. And there's been a lot of
changes to the targeting process and
we're in a very different place than
what we were say five six years ago. Um
Meta's targeting is still very powerful,
but the setup is different. I I'll go
through it and explain. So within this
audience section, we have two main
categories. We've got controls and we've
got suggest and audience. The difference
between these two sections is that
anything set within the control section
is a hard constraint, a hard boundary.
So you can see for example the location,
which I'll talk about in a second, the
default here is United Kingdom. Meta is
going to basically follow that
instruction. Right? We're only going to
put ads in front of people in the United
Kingdom. Whereas anything added in the
suggestion audience section is a
suggestion. You're basically giving
Meta's targeting algorithms an
indication of who you think should see
your ads, who your ad should be put in
front of. But at the end of the day,
it's up to Meta to either go with people
within that targeting criteria or find
other people that it thinks will are
likely to get you more of what we talked
about up here, which is maximize the
number of conversions, lead conversions.
Basically, who's likely to become a lead
might be outside your targeting
criteria, and Meta can go beyond that
with the suggest an audience section.
So, let's run through this. So the first
thing we need to decide is location.
This is defaulted to the whole of the
United Kingdom because that's where I'm
based, but that may or may not be right
for your business, right? So what should
we do here from a targeting standpoint?
It's very simple. Advertise where your
customers are. That might be one
country. That might be the whole of the
UK. That might be international. So for
example, we could advertise the whole of
UK. We could advertise the whole US. So
for example, our major markets as an
agency are going to be UK, US,
Australia, Canada. I mean, we actually
have clients literally in 50 plus
countries. Um, Western Europe and
Singapore and UAE and all sorts, right?
Um, but our major major markets are
going to be, you know, UK, US, Canada,
etc. So, we could, for example, look to
advertise to multiple countries. Or if
you're a local business, you could get a
lot more specific. So, let's say for
example, you're a local business based
in Bath, which is a place in the UK.
Uh, so Bath in Somerset. And if I delete
out the United States, we can see in the
map where we're targeting. So, we've got
Bath plus 25 miles as a default. You
might go, "Oh, no. You know, that's too
far. People either aren't willing to
travel to us if you're a local business
from that sense, or we're not willing to
travel that far." Because local business
could be either way, right? You could be
a plumber traveling to customers or you
could be a cafe with people coming to
you. Um, so you go, "No, no, no. We're
going to go with 15 miles around. I
think that's more appropriate."
Obviously, you can you can decide this.
Now, I don't want you to overthink this.
I don't want you to think, well, I'm a
local business, but um I have to
advertise nationally because Meta likes
nice big audiences. Like, no, no, no,
just where your audience are. I also
don't want you to artificially constrain
the location targeting just because you
think that's where the people are who
are most likely to be interested in in
your products or services. So, for
example, if you sell products nationally
in the UK, don't go, "Oh, I'm only going
to advertise in London because people in
London are wealthier and they're more
likely to buy my products and services."
Like, Meta will work that out. And if
your uh best prospects are in a certain
location, more of your ad spend will be
spent there. But you don't want to
artificially constrain it because Meta
might think might find some people that
are in not in that location that are
also great prospects even if the density
of those people in those other locations
is lower. Right? So basically where your
customers are is good to good to select.
One thing to quickly mention about local
businesses is you now have this option
which is reach more people likely to
respond to your ads and deselect it. So
it says here we'll also show ads to
people interested in your selected
cities and regions in those countries.
So for example, do we want people do we
want to advertise to people that are
interested in the city of Bath or not? A
lot of local businesses find that
they'll generate leads from people that
have traveled to that location. But if
you're a roofer, that's not overly
helpful because you're not going to be
able to serve those people that live
halfway across the country. So, a lot of
local businesses want to deselect this
even if Meta pops up a warning saying
you're likely to see worse results. 6.7%
lower cost per result if you select it.
Yeah, but what's the point having a
lower cost per lead if you can't service
those leads in this scenario? So, most
local business want to deselect this.
For demonstration purposes though, I am
going to go with uh for the rest of this
video, United Kingdom and just leave it
at that. Okay. Right. Moving on. We've
got show more controls. So, in show more
controls, we've got a minimum age. So,
you can select anything from 18 up to
25. This is typically recommended if
you're advertising something in a
particular location. And there are legal
restrictions on who can and can't buy
it. For example, in some places, you
need to be 21 to buy certain things,
right? So, you want to select 21 as your
minimum. Otherwise, often best to leave
it open. It only goes up to 25. This is
not like strict age targeting criteria.
This is just uh for the purposes that I
described. Custom audiences. I'll
explain in a second. And then we've also
got languages, right? So, it could be
that you can only serve people that
speak a certain language within a
certain location. If you operate within
a country with multiple languages, and
you think, are we only able to serve
this uh market? Then you can go ahead
and add in specific languages um if
that's appropriate for your business.
Most of the time, it's not going to be.
You can go with all languages. I'm going
to leave that as the default. Then we
get down and that's all you have control
over from a hard boundary standpoint
like do not go beyond these targeting
constraints to please Meta. Okay. So
then we've got the suggest an audience
section. So like I said these are
suggestions. This is designed to give
Meta direction. Particularly helpful
when you've got a new Meta ad account
when Meta doesn't know who's likely to
become a lead. They don't know that
people interested in cats who are 43 and
live in this certain location are most
likely to buy your products and
services. Right? As an example. Um, so
[snorts] here we can give medicine
direction. So we the first thing we've
got is include these custom audiences.
And I said I'd talk about custom
audiences a second ago. Custom audiences
are warm audiences. People that have
interacted with your business before.
Lots of different types of custom
audiences. People who visited your
website. People on your email list.
People who have engaged with your
Facebook page or Instagram profile,
watched videos of yours, become leads,
all sorts. I've got whole tutorials
about targeting and setting up custom
audiences and definitely something you
want to do later on. For now, don't
worry about it. Firstly, you probably
don't have much in the way of custom
audiences yet if you're just getting
started with your advertising. Secondly,
they can always be created and added in
later on. Okay. Then beneath that, we've
got age. Now remember, this is a
suggestion. So often you want to say to
Meta, these are my this is the age range
of my ideal prospects, my ideal
customers. But again, Meta can choose to
go outside that if they think there are
people that like to convert. So what we
typically do here is not get too
restrictive, but just think about like
your core demographic, your core target
market. So for a business like ours,
that's probably going to be something
like 30 to 55 in terms of we're looking
to reach business owners and marketing
professionals and marketing managers.
Yes, there going to be some people
younger, some people older, of course,
but that might be our core. Then you've
got genders. If you skew one way or the
other heavily, like 90% men, 90% women,
then go ahead and make a selection.
Otherwise, it's fine to leave it all.
Remember, Meta is going to work a lot of
this out for us in terms of um who's
likely to take the action we want to
take. And then we've got detailed
targeting. So here we can add in
demographics, interest, behaviors. You
can browse the various categories and
look for this. But often what I
recommend to get started is just enter
in some obvious options that sound about
right for your target audience. So for
example, we might have something like
social media marketing. If I add that in
as an option, right? So people
interested in social media marketing as
some as as a group of people we might be
wanting to target. Uh we could have
something like business page admins. So,
anyone that's an admin of a of a
business page um on Meta, then great, we
can go ahead and target those people.
Couple of simple options. You can add in
none here. You can add in one. You can
add in four. There's no right amount.
These are all suggestions. This is just
giving meta direction. Don't spend a ton
of time on this. It doesn't matter. Seen
a lot of people get really hung up on
this and like to test too much. That's
what we used to do number of years ago.
Not what we do anymore. You can click on
further limit the reach of your ads and
then get really specific with the
targeting and basically say to Meta,
"No, I only want to target these
people." Not something I'd recommend for
most beginners. It overcomplicates it
and typically we see better results now
by giving Meta direction and letting
Meta's machine learning algorithm work
it out as opposed to us advertisers
trying to have too much specific
control. Then beneath that, we've got
placements. So placements refers to the
locations where your ads can be shown.
So if we click in here, we can have a
look, right? So if I click into more
settings and we've got placement
controls uh included is 24. So we can
see actually if I go above that we've
got platforms. So we've got the the five
platforms currently Facebook, Instagram,
audience network, messenger or threads,
the places where ads can be shown. And
we can say no no I don't want any of my
ads to be shown on threads. Not sure why
you do that, but you can if you want. Um
audience network is typically considered
the lower quality placement option.
Audience network's going to refer to
things you you you'll have interacted
with these before where you sort of
click through on something on meta and
you come through to like an article or
an app or something along those lines.
That's going to be audience network. So
sometimes advertisers will look to to
deselect those. I'll explain that in a
second. And then if we click into
placements, we can see all the various
options, right? So we can break it down
by all the different feeds and say no, I
don't want to advertise on feeds or I
only want to advertise on stories and
reels or or etc etc. Right? So what
would my recommendation be here for
setting this up? If you are using a
leads campaign or a sales campaign, just
leave it as is. Basically, let Meta run
ads on all placements because they're
only going to put your ads on those
placements that Meta thinks are going to
get you the result that you've asked for
for a lead for a sale. So, absolutely
fine. If however you are forced to run a
different campaign objective like
traffic because you cannot track the
leads or sales that you generate then I
do think you want to become more
specific and the obvious option is just
to get rid of the audience network
because what you don't want is for Meta
to put your ads on the placement options
that are lower quality, less likely to
lead to a conversion. But that's exactly
what Meta will do if you're not
optimizing for a conversion because
those placements are cheaper. Other
advertisers aren't as interested in
those. Therefore, the cost is lower.
Remember, the price is set by simple
demand and supply and um and and yeah,
so you might want to come in and
deselect audience network if you aren't
able to track conversions. Most of you
will be. You'll have the pixel setup and
you're all good. Then you can go ahead
with just the default, which is uh
everywhere, all 24 placement options and
all five platforms. Run AB tests. Great
thing to do later on. Not something I'm
going to worry about right now. um all
this stuff here of brand suitability and
inventory filters and all that sort of
stuff that is beyond the scope of what
most beginner advertisers want to get
into. You can get really lost in this is
basically you as an advertising more
control around what your ads are put
alongside the context around them all
those sorts of things. A thing that a
lot of big brands care about quite a lot
because they really care about their
brand image. I personally don't feel
like, you know, what your ad is around
when a user is seeing your ad in context
of other um stuff that they see on
Facebook and Instagram is that
important. I think it kind of operates
as an isolated thing. Anyway, it's sort
of used now to scrolling through reels
or stories and you see very different
things, right? Different context.
They're not necessarily one is
associated with the other straight
after. I don't feel like it's a big
deal, but bigger brands uh find this
sort of stuff quite important and often
mess around with it significantly. Most
of the time it hurts results, but not
something you need to worry about as
beginners. And that is the ad set taken
care of. So now let's go ahead and jump
over to the ad level. Okay, so now it's
time for the ad level, the most
interesting part, the level that
determines what people actually see when
they're presented with your Facebook,
Instagram ads. First thing at the top
here to quickly mention is partnership
ads. Love partnership ads. allow you to
run ads um with creators and influencers
to help promote your products and
services. These are awesome. Not
something for beginners. You want to get
started with simpler campaigns first,
but definitely look to add this in later
on. I have content all about them. Then
you've got identity. So, make sure that
the Facebook page, Instagram account,
and threads profile that your ads are
going to come from on those various
platforms are all correct. Obviously,
people make errors here. And by the way,
those are my accounts. If you want more
information on Facebook and Instagram
advertising, go ahead and give me a
follow on whichever you typically use.
Branding is more an advanced thing.
Don't need to worry about that. Then we
get into ad setup. So we've got create
ad, which is the default. You could also
use existing post. So if you already
have a post, say on your Instagram
profile that's done well and you think,
oh, I want to run that as an ad, you can
go ahead and select existing post,
choose it, and go for it. U most of you
are going to want to be creating ads.
And that's typically what I'd recommend.
when you use existing posts, some of the
functionality is a bit limited because
it already exists as a post as opposed
to having full flexibility of an ad. And
also in terms of what you put out there
as say organic posts on on Facebook and
Instagram versus what you use as ads,
there's normally differences in the
content that's used. So when you use
when you're running ads, you're normally
going to have a stronger call to action
and things like that, right? So
typically you're going to be creating
ad. So we're going to go ahead and use
manual upload. Advantage plus catalog
ads. Again, slightly more of an advanced
thing, not something I'm going to cover
here, but just to know that if you are
an e-commerce business and you want to
run uh you have a catalog, you want to
run ads uh using a catalog, this is a
great way to go, particularly for
retargeting warm audiences, people who
have maybe checked out a product but
haven't yet converted. So, definitely
something to look to add in later on.
I've got content on that you can find on
my channel. But for now, we're going to
go with manual upload. Next, choose the
format. Do we want a single image or
video? That's what I'm going to go with
here. I'm going to use an image. Like I
said, I want the campaign creation set
up for you guys to be as easy as
possible to get started. But you can run
carousels. Carousels are like um cards
of different So, you've got an image
with some like a headline, another image
with a headline, another image,
headline, some pricing information,
sometimes extra info. You've probably
seen carousels before. Uh
multi-advertiser ads. Honestly, we've
tested this and we don't really see any
difference whether we have this selected
or deselected. So, I'm happy to leave it
on. Multi-advertiser ad says your ad can
appear with others in the same ad unit
to help promote discoverability. Doesn't
seem to make much difference either way.
So happy to uh to leave that on. And
then we get on to destination. Now your
destination is where people are going to
be sent after they click on your ads. So
because we selected website as the
conversion location at the adset level,
we need to enter in a website URL. So
this could be a product page if you're
advertising a product. Uh could be a
specific landing page for a service.
Could be even maybe the homepage of your
website. Wherever it is that you want to
send people directly. So, I'm going to
go ahead and paste a link in here just
to quickly explain um what we're going
to be using as the example because I've
got an example campaign. I'm going to
quickly put together an example ad I'm
going to put together uh to help you
understand the process. So, we have a
thing called my meta ads mentorship
program. And just to quickly explain
what that is included in it, we've got
unlimited one-to-one support. People can
ask us any questions they've got about
their meta ads. It's designed to provide
them all the support they need to get
the best possible results um from
Facebook and Instagram ads. We do daily
live calls and Q&A with me and my expert
team members. We've got exclusive
educational material, that sort of
thing, right? That that's the offer that
we're going to be advertising. By the
way, if you are interested in that,
there's a link in the um video
description, but that's what we're going
to be using as the offer. Um so, just
give you a bit of context around that
before we move on. So, I've gone and
entered in the URL to the landing page
for people to come through and book a
call. And when we run ads for our Meta
Ads membership program, which we do all
the time, um that's exactly where people
are sent straight through to this page
where they can go ahead and book a call.
Once you enter in the URL, you'll start
to see the preview over here, which is
really useful. You can't see much yet,
but as we add in things like add
creative and add copy, we'll be able to
see what it looks like um for the user
that's actually going to see it over
here in the preview, which is helpful.
So, we have this first option called
display link. Um so, you can see here
we've got admasters 365.com, which is
the link that I've added in up here. We
could change that using display link if
you want to. I don't want to here. Just
wanted to quickly highlight that it's an
option. Then, we've got these browser
add-ons. The default is none. And that's
what I'd recommend you go with for now.
I think that some of this stuff gets a
little bit too complicated, a little bit
too advanced for beginners. Um, you can
add, for example, a call button to your
website, an Instagram direct button on
your website, people to be able to
message you via Instagram, WhatsApp,
etc. Something you might want to mess
around with later on. In general, we
don't tend to use these because we want
people to take a very specific path, as
in they come through to a website or a
landing page and they take the one
action we're sort of leading them to
take as opposed to confusing them with
various different actions. But your
business might be like, "No, I'd love a
phone call or very happy to chat with
people via WhatsApp." Then you can go
ahead and set those up. Instant
experience. Again, not something we're
going to worry about. It's part of this
tutorial. And the same with Facebook
event. If you are advertising a Facebook
event, you're going to have to go
through that. But the vast majority
watching this are not going to fall into
that category. Then we get into the ad
creative section. Right? So, we've got
setup creative and then we can choose
between image ad and video ad. Like I
said previously, video ads can perform
really, really well. Image ads are much
simpler for people to to create and I'd
often recommend that advertisers get
started there. You can always look to
produce uh more sophisticated ad
creative things like video later on.
I've got video tutorials showing you how
to do that you can find on my channel.
But we're going to start nice and
simple, reduce that barrier to entry and
go with image ad. And once you select
image ad, the first thing that's going
to happen is Meta is going to try and
add in these various extensions. So, uh,
we've got some branding information
here, stuff that Meta is going to use to
try and work out when they produce AI
generated assets. You'll see what that
looks like in a second. And they're
going to use this information that we
add in here. And then we've got site
links, right? So, Meta is going to add
in extra links to other pages on our
website um, where people can go directly
instead of the main one that we're
looking to send people through. So, in
our case, site links could be things
like sending people through to a case
studies page or to a how it works page
or something like that, right? Um, I
think for beginners to get started, we
want to make this straightforward. Don't
worry about adding in any of the
branding stuff. We're not going to rely
too heavily on the AI generated assets
for now anyway. And I'd also probably
turn off site links. It might be really
appropriate for your business. You might
think, "No, great. I'm coming maybe from
a Google Ads world where you're used to
site links." But if you don't have
experience with that, it's just it's
added complication at this stage. It's
another thing to worry about. And again,
I don't really want when I'm running my
ads people to come through to other
pages on my site. I want them to come
through to the one place I want to come
through, which is a landing page where
they can go in and book a call. So, I'm
going to ignore this stuff for now. I'd
recommend you do the same to get started
with. Okay. And then we get to media.
So, a few different places where you can
grab the imagery or videos that you're
going to use. You can get them from your
Instagram account. You can get them from
your Facebook page. You can get them
from your ad account if you've uploaded
previously. We've obviously got a bunch
of options here because this is an
example ad account. So, I upload stuff
to be able to to demonstrate. Um, but
just wanted to highlight that if you've
already got stuff or you can just go
ahead and click upload over here and
select um any files that you've got from
your computer and get those uploaded.
Very straightforward. I've actually
already uploaded the files that I'm
going to use for demonstration purposes.
Like I said, we run ads for my meta ads
mentorship program already. So, we have
image ads that I can literally
demonstrate. So, I'm going to go ahead
and select this option and click next.
And you can see that when you add in
your ad creative, Meta is going to show
you what it looks like in the three main
formats. So, three main aspect ratios,
right? You've got square, you've got
vertical, and you've got horizontal.
Now, horizontal is by far the least
important because as a proportion of
your um ad impressions, horizontal is
going to be the fewest by far. Most of
your ad impressions are going to be from
a square um ad format or a vertical ad
format. Square is typically going to be
used for things like the feeds, um,
Facebook, Instagram feeds, lots of feed
options. Vertical is going to be things
like stories, reels across both
platforms. Now, what you can see is that
because I've uploaded a square image, it
works brilliantly for the square format.
But in the vertical and the horizontal,
not so great. So, in an ideal world,
what you would do is you would either
crop if possible. So, let's say we turn
that to 916, try and make it that just
doesn't work, right? Cuts off all the
text. It just it just won't work at all.
as an ad. So, we can't do that. Ideally,
you'd either crop and and change the the
dimensions, or you would replace it with
a different image that is specifically
designed and formatted for that aspect
ratio, which is exactly what I'm going
to do. So, I'm going to click replace
there. And we've got a vertical one
that's been selected. Go ahead and put
back. You see that looks much better in
that format. Right? You don't need to do
this. This is kind of an optional extra.
Meta is really smart nowadays. So, they
would have taken this image and probably
made something fairly similar looking to
this using um like image expansion and
they'll fill in the top and bottom for
vertical locations and they'll do
something with this to make it look
good. But just wanted to highlight that
if you have the capacity to spend a
little bit more time and effort on the
creative and make sure it looks good in
the various placement options then doing
so could be a good way to go. Um right,
just to quickly highlight the image as
well. So, this is obviously really
simple um what we've got here. here. So,
it's a picture of me. Mostly when we're
advertising our mentorship program, it's
to warm audiences. People have already
exposed to my business. People are
unlikely to sign up for a mentorship
program if they don't know who the
person is that's going to be mentoring
them, right? So, so because of the
nature of this offer, it's warm audience
specific. So, we definitely want a photo
of me in there that's going to help grab
attention. Very simple text on the
image. Want me to mentor you? Very clear
what this offer is all about. And then
it's kind of small. Hopefully, you can
see it. But we've basically just got
three testimonials highlighted. you
know, almost an 8x rat in 3 weeks from
someone made $29,000
with a 7.3x rat in 30 days. Um, from $30
a day ad spend to 100k month in sales in
just 3 months. So, differing degrees of
spend and success, but just a few quick
snippets that people can look and be
like, "Wow, I'd love a result like that
or results like that for my business."
So, you could it's relatively easy to
replicate something like this even if
you don't have much in the way of
graphic design skills uh and things like
that, right? Anyway, moving on. So,
let's go ahead and click next. Now, we
get into the text into the ad copy
section. So, the first part is primary
text. Now, in different placement
options, the copy and the text appears
in different locations. But if you think
about like a traditional Facebook feed
on mobile, you're going to have the
primary text above the image, then
you're going to have the image, then
you're going to have the headline
underneath it, and then beneath that,
you're going to have the description and
uh and the call to action button off to
the side. Okay? So, that's typically how
it's going to work. So, let me grab a
primary text that I've got that we've
used to advertise my meta ads mention
program. And all the stuff I'm adding in
here is stuff that has worked well and
it's good to learn from real life
examples that have performed well. So,
let's do that. Okay. So, I've just
pasted in the primary text and if I just
quickly read this so that you understand
the sort of thing I'd recommend you go
with and what we're looking to do here.
So, we've got tired of wasting money on
Facebook ads that don't deliver. We'll
mentor you daily to explode your
revenue. Limited spots available. Apply
now and transform your ad game. And then
we've got the link. Now, that is a very
short, simple piece of ad copy, but it
actually ticks a lot of boxes. And
that's what I try recommend you try and
replicate. We don't want to be writing
essays. People just aren't going to be
bothered to read it. But we're doing a
number of things here. So, we're
highlighting [snorts] the problem and
calling out the target audience with the
first sentence. Tired of wasting money
on Facebook ads that don't deliver. So,
anyone that is suffering from that
problem is likely to pay attention to
the rest of the ad. Um, it also is sort
of agitating that problem. We're
emphasizing like, ah, are you really
annoyed that you keep trying? It's just
not working. Then we got, we'll mentor
you daily to explode your revenue. So,
we've got a feature. What's involved in
this? Oh, it's a daily mentorship.
Gotcha. Um, to explode your revenue.
Great. That's exactly what I do. I
really want exploded revenue. So,
there's a benefit associated. Limited
spots available. Introducing scarcity.
Um, apply now and transform your ad
game. And there's a call to action. So,
you can see in just a couple of
sentences, we've ticked like a load of
boxes, right? We've called out the
audience. We've agitated the problem. We
have uh described the main feature, the
main benefit associated with it. We've
introduced scarcity and we've got a call
to action all in, you know, take six
different things there. Six, seven
different things within uh very within
just a couple of sentences. So something
like that obviously tailored to your um
offer, your business is likely to do
well. Right? Then what we've got here is
Meta is going to use AI to generate text
alternatives and they're going to do
that. You can see here tailor variations
to personas. So they've come up with
three different personas that they think
like basically avatars, target custom
avatars. We've got ambitious
entrepreneurs, digital marketers, and
small business owners. So Meta is like,
look, if we think that someone in your
target audience is an ambitious
entrepreneur, we're going to put this
primary text in front of them. Now they
may use other options as well but um but
we can take a look through these and
decide which we do and don't want to use
right so my recommendation with
everything AI generated copy imagery is
absolutely use it but you need to be the
filter as the advertiser cuz sometimes
it's going to be great you can just use
it other times some of the suggestions
are not going to work at all you can't
use them sometimes it's going to be of a
hybrid where you go well that's kind of
good but does need a little bit of this
changing and that changing to make it
work so we just quickly read this first
option we've got tired of throwing money
at Facebook ads don't deliver unlock
explosive revenue goes through with
daily mentorship limited spots
available. Apply now transform your ad
game. So I mean that's very very similar
to what we've got already like happy
just to include that. Uh stop wasting ad
spend on underperforming Facebook ads.
Get daily mentorship to scale revenue
and transform your ad game. Limit what's
available. Level up your expertise and
maximize ROI proven strategies. Yeah,
all good. So you might find that there
are options that you're like no I don't
want to use but you can look to add
these in. And if I just scroll back up
as well you'll see that primary text
we've got here one of five. So you can
have up to five different options. um
absolutely fine just to go with the one
if you just want to get started. You can
always add other ones in later on, but a
good idea to test multiple options
because it just increases the chance
that a you'll find an option that works
really well and b it gives meta more
flexibility. Look, like they've said, we
might put this ad copy in front of this
type of persona and this type of ad
copy. So basically, they're working out
different people within your target
audience and what they are most likely
to respond to. Much more of a tailored
ad deliver experience which can help
improve performance. Okay. Right? Then
we move on to the headline and then this
is a headline that worked well for us
which is just very simply daily Facebook
ads mentorship. Right. We can add add
headline options again. So you can see
it's one of five. The same principle
applies. You can have five headlines and
I would recommend it. And Meta is going
to AI generate some options for you.
Just quickly run through. So we got
explode your ad revenue. Now yeah that's
fine. Unlock ad mastery in 5 minutes
daily. That's not really how the
mentorship program is designed to work.
It's not 5 minutes daily. We have like
live calls Q&A that last longer. We have
training that last longer. You could do
5 minutes a day. you could do longer.
So, I don't like that option. It's not
good for our offer. Not going to go
through every single one here, but you
can just see the sort of process I'm
going through and the logic I'm going
through there over deciding what to
choose and what not to choose. Daily
membership for ad success sounds good. I
have other videos more detailed on ad
copy, by the way, in case you want to uh
to go through these. Right? Then we've
got description. So, this isn't going to
appear on every placement options, but
like I said, in the classic sort of
mobile Facebook feed, it's going to be
just under the headline. So we might go
with something like limited spots
available in order to um emphasize the
scarcity that and there are limited
spots available. We only have so many
coaches and so many slots available on
on the live calls and Q&As and things.
So yeah, uh absolutely fine to to put
that in there. Yours might be a a
scarcity thing or it might be urgency
based like we're running a current sale
but that ends at a certain time. There
are ways to incentivize that action. And
then we've got call to action button
here. Right? So what you see here will
depend on what type of campaign you're
running. So, if you're running a sales
campaign, you might see some slightly
different options. Um, although we can
still see things like shop now, for
example, even with the leads campaign,
learn more is the default. What I'd
recommend here is you just go with the
option that best describes what it is
you want people to do, like what's the
next step with a menship style offer,
something that people aren't necessarily
super familiar with. It's not as obvious
as other things that people are used to
buying all the time. Then we might have
something different. We might go with
contact us or we might go with schedule
a call or something like that. But I
think learn more is the appropriate next
option. In other time, other businesses,
service businesses, it might be get
quote is the next thing. It might be
shop now. Uh lots of different options
depending on what it is that you are
looking to do. Don't overthink it. Just
go with the option that best describes
um the next step. Right? Then we go with
next. Now what Meta is going to do is
they're going to take the image that
you've that you've added in and they're
going to use AI to generate other
versions. So this is a tool that is
improving all the time. uh and it's very
interesting that it's doing so and and
uh by the time you watch this you might
see that the options have improved again
substantially. So if we look at what
Meta is looking to do here they've
basically most of these are just
changing background colors for example
or changing the location. So that room
behind me actually looks like one of our
one of our office one of our meeting
rooms in our office. Um which might be
coincidence or they may have found it
elsewhere but like that's basically the
same image as what we've got but it's a
different color scheme. like, "Yeah,
sure. Happy to use that." Uh, again,
same with that one. Although maybe the
text isn't as good to read, but there
are options that we absolutely can't
lose. So, it's, for example, want me to
mentor you, and they've sort of AI
generated a woman there. Like, it has to
be me in these ads, right? In order for
this process to work, want me to mentor
you without me in the thing. That's just
not going to work. This is mostly
advertised to warm audiences. Um, that
version of me is like, I guess it's kind
of me, but not really. kind of looks a
little bit like someone else or you know
that get we can't use that, right? It
has to actually actually be me in there.
These options down the bottom obviously
wouldn't work. So you could be the
filter. You might find some work really
well. What what you see here um will
absolutely depend on what you upload.
And for some businesses, you're going to
see better options than others. So if
you're uploading an image, for example,
of a product, the AI generated image
options can work really well because
Meta is going to use different
backgrounds or put them into different
scenes. Whereas when you're using people
in your ads, particularly if you that
needs that person needs to be the same
person involved like it is here, less
so. But when I did this video a year
ago, it didn't come up with any versions
of me at all. So we just couldn't use
this use any of the AI generated images.
Now we can. You can see this is
improving um all the time. So just add
in the ones you're happy with. The meta
is basically going to test different
variations, see which works best, right?
Fairly straightforward. Okay, let me go
ahead and click next. And then we've got
enhancements. So, these are things that
Meta is going to do to try and improve
the quality of our ad creative in order
for us to get better results or at least
test it, right? So, we can see we've got
three for review. So, Meta has decided,
you know, we don't think that having
these on makes a lot of sense. Let's
have these um turned off and then
they've put turned on seven that we
could also review. So, for example, they
they said we don't think it's best to
have enhanced media text. So, we'll
replace the text in your media, not in
the ad copy, in your media with AI
generated text. Yeah, I don't want that.
We want the message to be clear and
consistent. That could go wrong. And
then we've got translate text turned
off. Yeah, we don't want the text to be
translated into other languages because
we can only provide the menship program
in English. You know, me and my expert
team members that that run the program,
we speak English and we we operate in
English, right? So, so we can't we we
want to translate to other languages
because we can't then fulfill in those
other languages. And then Meta have also
turned off um enhanced CTA which I'm
absolutely happy with. Let's have a
quick look at the other active
enhancements. These are things that Meta
has turned on and saying, "Look, we
think these are going to help improve
performance." So, we've got ad overlays,
right? So, they can add um text overlays
over the top of the image to highlight
certain things, grab things from the
landing page or the ad copy. You know,
with an image like this, I probably
would actually turn that off because
look, it's already really textheavy. If
it was less text heavy, I'm happy to
leave it on because the overlays can
often improve performance. So, I'm going
to turn that off. Then, we've got visual
touchups. Okay, so we'll automatically
crop, expand your chosen media to fit
more placements. Well, we've kind of
done that to some extent with the three
main formats. Normally, I'm happy for
that to stay, though. Uh, Meta is pretty
good at making that make sense to add in
add music. They basically turn your uh
image into like a short video, add some
music overlay. Um, I'm happy to leave
that on. I totally get some businesses
aren't. They want to be much more
specific of like, no, I couldn't
possibly have that that audio. You can
customize this. So, you can leave this
on. What have they got for us for now?
just a little like corporate jingle
basically like that's fine. I'm happy to
do that. You can customize and then say
no I want specifically to play this
music not that music or you can just go
ahead and turn that off. Uh text
improvements. So any text you provide
may appear as primary text headline
description. So you know we wrote in the
various locations that is saying we
might choose to move this around right
so you know one of those headline
options we might just stick that in the
primary text or we might change
description. I'm normally quite happy to
leave that on. Sometimes that will mean
the ad doesn't make sense depending on
how you've constructed your copy, in
which case you want to turn that off.
Um, in our case, for example, that
primary text can't be used as a headline
because it's too long. Um, so that will
just won't happen. Uh, but again, you
can customize that or turn that off
depending on what you want to do. I
normally have to leave it on because if
meta, for example, wanted to switch my
description, my headline, which is how
it would work in reality given the copy
we set up, like no biggie. Um, adapt.
Here we go. Adapt multi-image format.
So, we'll show ads with multiple images
as a video or slideshow or a video
collection. Now, we haven't got multiple
images in there. It's already on. They
might use the v different variations
that we had to try and create something.
Again, I'm kind of happy for Meta to
play with this and do what it can. If
Meta creates anything or adds variations
and additions based on the ad creative
that we've uploaded that kind of doesn't
work and doesn't make sense, well, as
soon as they put it in front of users,
they won't take action because it
doesn't make sense. and they'll very
quickly learn and stop doing that and
test other options. So, I don't think
this adds much or really makes any
difference to this particular ad. If you
were running like um a carousel or um
had an ad campaign with lots of
different images, then this could be
really quite valuable. So, I'd recommend
normally leaving that on. We've got ad
animation. So, Meta can basically turn
this image into something that can move.
They can animate text, various elements.
Again, happy to leave that on. And then
we've got flex media. So show media you
chose for a specific aspect ratio across
all placements when it's likely to
improve performance. So you know how we
had the square versus the vertical. What
meta is basically saying here is like
look we might go ahead and use the
square um in the vertical placement or
we might go ahead and use the vertical
uh format that you gave us in say the
feeds where it actually take up
basically your whole screen as you're
scrolling through a feed if we think it
improve performance. Again quite happy
for meta to work that out. So this is
very much go through decide the ones you
want to use decide the ones you don't
want to use. I would on the side of
trusting Meta with this. Highly
incentivized to improve stuff to help us
get better performance. But I know a lot
of advertisers are nervous about that.
They want to turn these off and be like,
"No, no, no. Just put the ad as is in
front of people." That's, you know, I
totally get that. That's fine, too.
These typically don't make a huge amount
of difference um whether you have them
on or off either way. Um okay. So now we
can start to see the preview come
together, right? We've got, so for
example, this option here, this is like
a Facebook feed. We've got um the text,
the primary text. We've got the image.
We've got the headline. We can't see the
description here. I guess it's not going
to play show on all placements. We've
got the learn more call to action
button. Uh we've got the image. We've
got the other image variations that Meta
has come up with. And then we can see,
you know, via there's lots of things you
can go through in the preview. So you
can see via um different locations. So
we've got Facebook feed there. Uh it's
taking a second to load. We can have a
look at what it look like on the
Instagram feed. So like the primary text
at the top. You just go through the
various placement options and just make
sure it all makes sense. Um if you set
it up how I how I have, you're
basically'll be fine. got a warning to
add product or site links, but no, I'm
all good for what that is. And we went
through that window. You can adjust it
from within here as well. So, if you're
like, ah, okay, started with the brawn
primary text, but I want to add in some
other primary text, you can go ahead and
do so and get those added in here.
Same's going to apply to headlines. And
then we've obviously got this other
stuff, description, optimize text by
person. You can leave that as enabled.
That was based on the creative enhance
we talked about. And then we've got call
to action, learn more, absolutely fine.
Run AB test to see the results. Not yet.
Definitely something to do later down
the line once you've got a little bit
more experience with your uh meta ads,
but right now happy to leave that off.
And we can also go back in and edit
these creative enhancements. So we ended
up with six out of 10 on um going
through that process. Um but you can
change that should you wish to creative
testing. So we can set up different
tests between different ads. So let's
say we had one image and we wanted to
test that not just like different
variations like we've got here, but
against totally other images. You can
absolutely do that within the one ad
unit. Not something I want you to mess
with for now. Um, but yeah, just know
it's an option. Same's going to apply to
languages. Uh, for the vast majority of
you, you're just going to go go with the
the one language. Then we get into
tracking here. Basically, you just want
to make sure that um you can see the
pixel and you need to have, like we
talked about before, if you're
generating leads, generating sales by
your website, you need to have the pixel
installed. Ideally, you would also have
the conversions API installed and you
would have all that tracking set up. I
have other videos that cover that, but
here's where you just basically come
down and just check that the pixel is
actually here and that that's the right
pixel. You can check the ID based on
what you set up. Um, I've seen issues go
down. And what's basically saying is
that Meta is going to track these ads.
We can add in other things if that's
appropriate for a business like URL
parameters to track. If you're um that
way inclined and you do a lot of
tracking, say via Google Analytics or
another another um platform and you want
to to cross reference things and really
understand your data, you can go ahead
add those in. But I think most beginners
that is probably overkill and then that
is our campaign setup. We can go ahead
and click publish. Meta is normally
going to take a bit of time to review
the ad, make sure it complies with
advertiser policies. Normally takes
about 30 minutes, but particularly with
your first ads could take um a while
more. And then you should start to see
your ads being delivered and you can
quickly have a look at the uh data
generated. So if I just close down the
campaign, we won't have any here, but
you'll be able to see things like your
cost per result. You'll be able to see
impressions, how many um times have our
ads seen, how many people has it
reached, all the various data points.
There's lots of other things. I've got
other videos on um analytics and
analyzing data and what to look for and
how to optimize campaigns and things
like that. But that is the process of
getting your first or a proper Facebook
ad campaign set up. If you've already
created them but weren't 100% sure that
you set up everything correctly, that is
how you do it. Now, I quickly want to
touch on campaign structure. So, what I
demonstrated here is one campaign, one
ad set, one ad. Although, there are a
few variations of things like primary
text headlines and the images themselves
within that ad. Um, and that is
absolutely fine to get started with.
I've talked about throughout this video
keeping it simple, making
straightforward as possible. You can
make things really complicated should
you wish to um later on, but let's keep
it simple to start with, easy to
understand, easy to set up. As you go
on, you're going to want to add other
things, probably other campaigns for
things like different services,
different product ranges, certainly
different ads to be able to test
different creators. I've got a video on
campaign structure you can find on my
channel and you can go through that in a
lot more detail, but fine to get started
with this current structure. And then in
terms of what to watch next, I recently
recorded a video talking about exactly
what I would do if I was starting
Facebook ads all over again today. And I
think that would be a really good thing
for you to watch next. You can check it
out here. I go through what you need to
focus on, what you don't need to focus
on. You now know how to create a
Facebook ad campaign from scratch. But
there's more to it than that. There's
other considerations that I cover in
this video
