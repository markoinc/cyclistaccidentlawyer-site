I've spent millions of dollars over the
last couple years on Facebook ads alone
and if you're completely new to Facebook
advertising you stumbled across the
Right video by the end of this video
your account is going to be fully set up
and you're going to have an
advertisement ready to launch make sure
you're following along while you're
watching this video and setting it up
step by step that way your account is
set up properly and trust me when I say
this it's 2025 and Facebook ad campaigns
are easier to set up than ever all right
with that being said let's get right
into it the very first thing that we
have to do and it's kind of boring but
it is super super important to set this
up properly what you need to set up is
your Facebook business manager account
so if you don't have one of these
already then just follow these super
easy steps you're going to go on
facebook.com for business you're going
to log in with your personal account now
a lot of people ask me you know if I'm
using my personal Facebook that's linked
to my Instagram do people see this that
follow me and the answer to that is no
your personal Facebook and your personal
Instagram account even if they're link
to your business account people cannot
see what you're doing on the business
side of things you don't have to worry
about any of your followers seeing what
you're doing on the business side of
Facebook so once you're on the business
for Facebook page all you're going to do
is sign up log in with your Facebook
account and then you're going to be good
to go now once you log into that you're
going to get on the business manager
side of Facebook so this is where you're
going to link all of your pages your
Instagram accounts for your business as
well as setting up your ad account here
before we can actually move into the fun
stuff which is just setting up the
campaigns so on the left side here
you're going to see your pages your
people your partners your ad accounts
basically everything that is able to be
managed on Facebook business and the
structure that they have on Facebook is
technically your personal account and
then your business manager accounts and
then underneath those are your ad
accounts your pages that are linked to
that specific ad account as well as your
Instagram account so that's kind of how
the structure is laid out you really
only need one business manager account
right now if you are just starting off
but what's really really important is
when you get into this page and your
business manager is set up is that you
need to have your Facebook page and your
Instagram account linked to that ad
manager account so under the account
section here if you look at pages and
you don't have one up yet which I'm
assuming you don't if you're brand new
to Facebook advertising all you have to
do here to set it up for your business
is go on to the right side and click on
ADD and then here you can add an
existing Facebook page request a shared
access to a Facebook page if you're
managing the account for someone else or
if you're completely brand new you'll
just create a new Facebook page when you
create a new one for your business all
you have to do is enter your page name
the category the bio confirm the page
and you are done you can set up
everything later you can add all the
images the details that is all up to you
you treat that Facebook business page
like an Instagram business account once
you have that Facebook page set up the
next thing that you want to do is set up
your Instagram accounts so if you go
under the section here that says
Instagram accounts if you don't have one
for your business you have to add one
you technically can run Facebook ads
just off of a Facebook page but if
you're selling products online whether
they're digital or physical products
you're going to want an Instagram
account as well it's better to have an
Instagram presence and while you're
running your advertisements your
Instagram account is naturally going to
grow just from people seeing your paid
traffic now we need to do the exact same
thing that we did with the Facebook page
we're going to click on ADD at the top
right if you already have an existing
Instagram account you you can link it
here if you want to create a new one
you're going to go through that exact
same process just set it up with the
same business name that you use for
Facebook agree to the terms set up that
account and of course later on down the
road you can start posting on there as
well add the link and bio all of that
stuff but for right now to set up our ad
account in general we just need to have
these Pages linked onto our ad account
once you've got that set up you're going
to want to move over to ad accounts so
under your account section go into ad
accounts on your Facebook business
manager you're most likely not going to
have any accounts here so what we're
going to do again is ADD you're going to
create a new ad account and then you
would add the ad account name so you can
have the account name as test Shopify if
you're using Shopify hit next this ad
account is going to be used for my
business unless you're doing this as an
agency then it would be another business
or client go ahead and hit next it's
going to say hey this is your Shopify
business manager the BM account and
underneath that account which I was
talking about earlier will be your ad
account so this one you can see here is
under it and it's called test Shopify
I'm going to agree and click create the
account now here it's going to ask ask
you if you want to add payment info onto
your account so they charge credit cards
or PayPal to run your advertisements now
you don't have to do this right now you
can if you want to I would recommend
just getting it out of the way by adding
a credit card or your PayPal once you
finish that up you're just going to go
ahead and hit done and now you've got
your test Shopify account that we just
assigned here so our connected assets we
don't have any connected assets yet now
what we need to do is connect that
Instagram account that we created and
your Facebook account to this ad account
to be able to manage it inside the ads
manager we're actually going to be
connecting the Facebook page and the
Instagram account during the setup
process in the ad manager under our
campaign so we're actually going to be
coming back to that and the next thing
that you want to do is have a pixel
assigned to your account as well for
those of you that don't know a pixel is
a line of code essentially that is
collecting data from your website and
sending it back onto Facebook ad manager
this is how they record purchases clicks
add to carts basically all the
information that you need to know when
you're running your ad campaigns you can
either set up your pixel on the back end
of your business manager right here or
you can set it up during the campaign
process as well so to do this on the
back end we're going to go down to data
sets then we're going to click on ADD
and then we're going to create a new
data set so it's going to be test
Shopify if we're using our Shopify store
uh we don't need to request a demo of
the conversion API Gateway we're just
going to go ahead and hit create now
you're going to see your new pixel here
it's going to say test Shopify so what
we need to do now is connect our assets
so we're going to click on connect
assets again at the top middle right
here click on other business assets then
we're going to sign it to the ad account
that we just created so this is the test
Shopify one hit add and now our pixel is
linked to that ad account but if you are
running a store on Shopify you do need
to log into your Shopify account and add
the Facebook sales app when you install
that app on Shopify you're going to log
in with the exact same Facebook login
information that you did here and then
you're going to choose that business
manager that you just created your ad
account that you just created in the
pages and that pixel will actually
populate on Shopify as well you'll check
that box and it'll be installed onto
your Shopify Shopify store if that's
what you're using if you're using a
different third party platform besides
Shopify you essentially would do it the
exact same way and if they don't have an
app on their platform for whatever
reason you can manually add the line of
code for that pixel onto the header of
your website in the HTML file and I know
that's a lot and most people are using
Shopify I wouldn't worry about that too
much but if you are using a third party
I'd probably switch over to Shopify and
if you don't want to do that then you
can manually do it that way so now we've
got our pixel set up our ad accounts our
pages and Instagram account now we're
pretty much good to go to start running
ads and creating our first campaign so
from the business manager we're going to
click on ads manager and now the ads
manager is going to bring you here so
this is where you're going to manage all
of your advertisements check on all of
the metrics set your budget your
strategies everything is pretty much
hous in here this is where you're going
to live if you're running paid ads I'll
cover the metrics and what each one kind
of means and what you should be looking
for when you're running your campaigns
to see if they're performing well or not
later on in this video so make sure to
stay around for that because it is super
simp super important to be able to read
your analytics and your metrics
correctly so Facebook ad campaigns are
set up in a three- tier type of system
so there's the campaign level there's
the ad set level and then there's the ad
creative level the campaign level is
just the overarching objective of the
campaign there's not too many settings
there it's basically do you want to run
a sales campaign to try to get people to
purchase from your website or do you
want to run an engagement campaign where
you're just going to get a bunch of
views on a video the adset level is
where you do all of your targeting so
the age demographics the location the
placements of the ad essentially who you
want to Market to and then the ad
creative level is where you upload your
image or video that you're going to be
running you're also going to edit the
captions of the video or the
advertisement in the link to where they
should go after they click so like I
said earlier it's 2025 and Facebook ads
have really mastered making this as easy
as possible there's no crazy strategies
anymore everything is super simplified
and pretty much done for you and it's
kind of just plug andplay so let's set
up our first campaign now so what we're
going to do is click on create at the
top left it's going to bring us to the
campaign objective now the buying type
we're always going to leave at auction
you want to have Facebook auction off
their ad space this is how you get the
lowest cost per purchase and the lowest
bids on Advertising now to choose our
campaign objective there's awareness
traffic engagement leads at promotion in
sales awareness will just show your ad
to as many people as possible but it's
not optimizing for sales and if you
choose awareness do not expect to get
any sales on your website it's just
going to be probably a bunch of Click
Farms to be honest with you or even if
they are real people there are people
that are most likely not going to
convert on your website and you're kind
of just wasting your ad spend that same
goes with traffic do you want people to
click onto your website and not do
anything then go for traffic engagement
campaigns can be useful if you're
running leads or top of funnel messages
if you're selling a digital product or
something like that engagement and leads
are pretty similar to be honest with you
app promotion is essentially just
getting people to install your apps so
people that are most likely to install
apps from an ad they see but where 99%
of us are going to sit and live is going
to be in our sales campaigns if you're
running an Ecom store or you're selling
anything at all you're going to want to
run a sales campaign what it's doing is
telling Facebook to run the
advertisements to people that are more
likely to purchase people that have
history from clicking on ads and
purchasing on Facebook I recommend
always doing this unless you have some
reason to do another campaign objective
which I don't think if you're watching
this video you probably need any of
these so we're going to click on sales
and we're going to click on continue now
there's two options for our campaign
setup we could do Advantage Plus
shopping camp campaign or a manual sales
campaign a vantage plus shopping
campaign has very limited options to
choose from all of the options are
pretty much chosen for you it's really
quick to do but I personally like to go
to the manual sales campaign because I
like a little bit more control and
optionality when I'm running my
campaigns so with that being said I
recommend doing a manual sales campaign
in the beginning and now it's going to
take us into our campaign editor so
we've got our campaign level right here
is the first step that we need to fill
out and remember what I was talking
about earlier there are three different
levels to the camp campaigns here we've
got The Campaign level we've got the
adet level and we've got the ad creative
level now keep in mind you can run
multiple ads sets under one campaign so
for example if you wanted to duplicate
this you could add it you could
duplicate it right here and then there
would be two ad sets with two add
creative levels underneath each one you
could use this to AB test maybe one of
them you want to test uh people that are
18 to 25 and one that is 25 to 35 you
can create as many ad sets as you want
but what I recommend doing if this is
your first time running Facebook ads is
is to stick with one campaign one adset
level and then multiple creatives
underneath that to see which one
performs the best so with that being
said let's name our campaign so it's
going to be our test Shopify campaign
you can name this whatever you want I
recommend naming them something that has
to do with your targeting in your ads
within this campaign so for example for
this campaign if I'm doing 18 plus and
us-based people only I could label it
right there that way you don't have to
dig deep and see what you were targeting
at the time to see if it was performing
well or not it just makes it a little
bit easier when you start running a
bunch of different campaigns now the
next section is special ads category
this is for if you want to declare a
category like employment housing social
issues politics Financial products uh
most of the time if we're selling a
physical product you don't need to
declare anything so 100% the time for me
I skip over this but if you fall into
that category then this is where you
want to um identify that now moving
below that is the campaign details we
don't need to change anything here cuz
we already selected these options we've
got the auction and the sales campaign
below that is the Advantage Plus Catal
ads so if you have your Shopify store
linked and you have catalogs on your
Shopify store you can run specific
Advantage Plus catalog ads only so it'll
pull products from that Shopify catalog
and place them into the creatives for
you if this is your first time I don't
recommend testing this out we don't want
to run a catalog ad you're most likely
just running an advertisement to a
specific product so we're going to leave
this one off and the next option is
Advanced campaign budget which used to
be called a CBO AKA campaign budget
optimization and so what this means if
you turn this on and there's a budget
here if you have $20 daily budget what
this Advanced campaign budget means is
it's going to take this $20 and let's
say you have five ad sets here and and
five creatives under each of them it's
going to take this daily budget of $20
and distribute it throughout those adets
and AD creatives how it sees fit
Facebook is going to work to identify
which one it thinks is performing the
best and then it's going to spend more
of that money in that one and then Less
on the other ones now Advanced campaign
budget can be really really powerful if
you have multiple winning ad creatives
already established you can pop in all
of your winning ad creatives under
different ad sets and move them into an
advanced campaign budget so wherever
Facebook decides to spend that allotted
amount you're most likely going to get
some really good cost per purchases
because you know there's five winning ad
creatives in there already but of course
if you're just starting off and you're
running just one or two ad creatives
underneath the ad set you don't need to
have this on now AB testing option does
exactly that so AB test for you but
we're going to kind of manually be doing
that with our ad creatives if you're new
to advertising or you're advertising a
new product the first thing that I
always want to do and recommend everyone
do is to test ad creatives against each
other first if you only create one ad
creative you're just spending all of
your money on one creative and you're
hoping that it works and it resonates
with the audience if you've got five ad
creatives then there's five options for
the audience to choose which one they
like the best so what I personally like
to do if I'm testing a brand new product
is I'll have five different ad creatives
with five different marketing angles in
each of those ad creatives so if I'm
selling a jade roller for for your skin
for example the five creatives that I'd
come up with with five different
marketing angles could be one that is
emphasizing how it reduces skin redness
the other one is maybe reducing fine
lines and wrinkles and so on and so on
so all have five different kind of hooks
and also angles on that advertisement
and those are going to be testing
against each other and then whichever
one is winning or has the most sales
that'll indicate to me that that's what
the audience in the market wants they
want to reduce fine lines and wrinkles
they don't care about skin redness and
then from there I'll go into optimizing
the landing page for the fine lines in
wrinkles angle and then I'll start
cranking out a bunch of other new
creatives with that same angle but with
different styles and then I'll test
those against each other but that's a
little bit later on down the road for
right now we're just going to be setting
up this campaign here so those are the
only options that we need to do on the
campaign level so we filled everything
out we really didn't change anything
we're going to go ahead and hit next now
this brings us to the adet level so the
adset level again is where you're going
to be doing your targeting so for this
example it's 18 plus is what we're going
to be advertising to and we're going to
be doing it uh in the US only so same
thing with titling your campaign you
want to make sure that your adset is
titled in a way that you're going to
remember it and you know exactly what
you're targeting now scrolling down to
the conversion section there's website
and Shop there's website app website and
app message calls website and calls so
most of the time you're going to be
wanting to do either website or website
and shop now the difference between the
two of these options here is website and
Shop will also allow the customer to
shop directly on Instagram or Facebook
if you have your Facebook shop and your
Instagram shop set up and to set that up
and if you want to do that you do have
to apply on your Instagram account and
they have to verify your products and
verify your account and make sure that
it's all legit and make sense and then
they will grant you access to Instagram
shop where then you can run ads to it
shopping on Facebook and Instagram can
be really profitable sometimes because a
lot of people don't like leaving the app
they want to just you know make a quick
purchase but there's also times where
your product makes more sense to
actually send them to the website if
it's a higher ticket product or you need
to really emphasize the marketing angle
that you're running you might want to
send them to your Landing page that way
they can learn more about your brand
your product and why they need that
product I personally like to send them
to the landing page so we're going to be
using website as the conversion metric
here now scrolling down to our
performance goal we want to maximize the
number of conversions we don't want to
maximize the number of landing page
views we want people to come onto our
website and purchase from us that way we
can be profitable now for the data set
section this is where we add the pixel
that we just created this one I did not
have a pixel so I'll do it again I
thought I already added it but maybe not
now for the data set sections this is
where we're going to select the pixel
that we just created the one that we
linked onto our Shopify store or
whatever third party website you're
using this is where it's going to show
up mine says inactive cuz it's test
pixel if you already have your website
up uh just click it a couple times make
sure it's linked correctly and it'll say
it's active once it starts tracking some
data make sure you click on the right
pixel if you've got multiple you don't
want to mess that up now for our
conversion event this is what we want to
mainly track and there's a bunch of
different options but what we care about
the most in e-commerce and selling
products is obviously purchases we want
to make sure that that is set we want to
receive the metrics and optimization for
purchases what that means is when you
start running advertisements on Facebook
the more purchases that come through and
get collected by your pixel the more
robust your pixel becomes it starts
learning from those purchases
identifying those customers and it
starts optimizing and getting better and
better because it learns about the
people that are purchasing and it starts
showing your ads to people that look
like the people that have purchased
that's super super important and always
know that in the beginning Facebook
might take a little bit of time before
it start starts optimizing before you
get your first purchase and before your
pixel just gets better and better as it
builds that data now if you have this
error like me because it's a new pixel
you can set up your conversions here if
you haven't done so already when you set
up your pixel but you're going to track
your conversions with standard events
your event code we're going to leave at
e-commerce and retail for the most part
so it's going to track all of these
things we'll just hit done and now our
pixel is set up and you should test it
just in case is not firing correctly or
you didn't install it correctly once
that is linked the cost per result goal
is the next option we have no idea what
the average cost per purchase is going
to be if you have a brand new account
but if you're curious what this means is
if you are trying to get a cost per
purchase of $15 you can type in $15 here
and then Facebook is going to try to get
that for you but don't think that you
can just put a dollar and Facebook is
going to go after a ton of people and
you're going to get dollar cost per
purchase that is not how that works at
all actually most of the time whenever I
set a cost per purchase goal it actually
never works and hardly spends any money
at all you really want Facebook to run
free and make the best decisions that
they can without narrowing down your
audience to people that they think will
hopefully purchase for just a dollar and
AD spend it's very unrealistic and most
of the time it just doesn't actually
work or spend money the next option that
we have here is the dynamic creative
where Facebook will automatically create
combinations of your media and texts
that your audience is likely to respond
to I don't really like doing Dynamic
creative too much and plus also it's
going away soon so I would just leave it
off for now you just want to do some of
this stuff a little bit more manually
now going down to the budget and
schedule section this is how much you're
going to spend daily or you can have the
option to do a lifetime budget let's say
you had a campaign you're willing to
spend $500 that's your maximum you could
set this to$ 500 and after it hits that
spend it will automatically turn off I
don't like doing lifetime budgets I just
like monitoring them daily so what I
would recommend doing is starting off
with just your daily budget and remember
what I was talking about earlier this is
an adet budget we have $20 on it right
now so anything that's under this
specific adset will have $20 allocated
to it so if you have three creatives
that we're testing under this ad set
it's going to take $20 and spend it
however it sees fit on these creatives
one could get $10 another one could get
five and the other one could get five
it's going to try to figure out which ad
is performing the best and the audience
likes the most and so you're going to
see one do better than the others it's
very similar to The Campaign budget
optimization but just at one more level
down now a lot of people ask me how much
money should I spend on Facebook ads per
day this is totally up to you and your
budget and what you're willing to spend
in test now I do recommend having a
minimum of $25 it collects your data a
little bit quicker I personally test
with like $200 to $250 but uh a lot of
people don't have that budget or want to
spend it but really the only difference
between a $20 a day budget and 200 is
that you're spending 10 times more per
day but you're also collecting your data
to make an educated decision on your ads
10 times faster so I like getting my
data quickly to make a decision but it
can be a scary budget if you don't get
any sales then you just blew all that
money but you did buy one thing at least
which is the data so I personally
recommend going with 25 to start off in
the beginning and also a lot of people
ask me how much money should I spend
before deeming an ad creative or a set
uh you know a failure a really good rule
of thumb is to spend at least three to
five times your aov which is your
average order value so if you're selling
your product for $100 I would recommend
spending $300 to $500 on Facebook before
making any decisions at all it's going
to give Facebook enough time to collect
the data and then you can make a
decision of how it's looking after that
you might get two sales the first day
and zero the next day or zero sales the
first day and five the next day the more
money that you spend on Facebook the
better the pixel optimizes and the
higher chances of you actually becoming
profitable now another good rule of
thumb is to let your ads run for at
least a week and the reason behind that
is for example if we're running a golf
product and for some reason everyone
buys golf products right after they go
to the golf course and most people will
golf on Saturday and Sunday on the
weekend so maybe my highest converting
days are on Saturday and Sunday but if I
only ran my ads Monday to Thursday I
might have missed out on the weekend
sales and it actually could have been a
winning advertisement but I just never
gave it a chance to run through that
entire week cuz people spend their money
differently depending on on the product
and what day they would buy things
another example if you're selling
alcohol it's probably higher likelihood
to sell it on Friday and Saturday than
it is on Tuesday so the same kind of
philosophy in like a brick and mortar
store kind of applies to online business
as well if you guys are learning and
enjoying this walkthrough so far make
sure to subscribe leave a comment if you
have a question it really helps me out
it pushes this out to the algorithm more
so I would appreciate that and also if
you're brand new to online business and
you want to get your first custom store
made for you on Shopify for free I'll
have that down below in the description
as well you get a free mentorship with
it in a free 35-minute course there's no
catches there Shopify pays me to train
you guys now moving on after our budget
we've got the schedule so we have our
start date and our start time you can
also add an end date in end time if you
only want to run the campaign for
Father's Day you're going to end it
after Father's day but most of the time
unless it's a special holiday you're
going to want to let it run forever
until you turn it off so I don't really
ever set too many end dates to be honest
with you now the next option is budget
scheduling so what this tool does is you
can say between Mondays and Tuesdays
from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. spend the
most money or only run our ads during
that time now this can be a really
really powerful tool later on down the
road because like we were saying about
the golf products if Monday through
Thursday they're unprofitable but you've
noticed that Friday Saturday Sunday you
have a great return on your ad spend
once you collect that information and
make those educated decisions you can
come back in here and say hey only run
it on Friday or Sunday and just spend a
ton of money and then maybe you only
sell on Friday through Sunday that's a
great example of why collecting your
data is so so important in actually
reading the metrics correctly but for
now if this is your first time running a
campaign we're going to leave this off
cuz we don't have that information yet
now scrolling down to audience controls
this is where we can change the location
of the targeting the minimum age
excluding certain custom audiences all
this is done right here so if you want
to you know advertise to the United
States as well as Canada you just type
it in here and you can advertise to any
country that you want I personally do
usually the top five for me are Canada
United States United Kingdom Australia
and New Zealand those typically see the
best conversion rates you just have to
make sure that you're able to obviously
ship your product out to those countries
this is totally product dependent you
know if people don't purchase your
product in Germany for some reason it's
only in the United States just choose
United States here you can dive down
even further I could say Scottsdale
Arizona if I wanted to advertise only in
Scottsdale if I'm a brick and mortar
store or I'm selling a Scottsdale based
t-shirt product or something like that
you can advertise just to Scottsdale
most of the time in Ecom we want to sell
products kind of throughout the world or
at least the United States so we're
going to leave that as United States
only the minimum age here you can change
if you have a product that you know only
resonates with people that are 60 plus
you can change that here now down to the
minimum age so this is where you can
change the minimum age up into 25 you
can't go past that in this section and
this is usually for like you know if
you're I guess doing a rental car
business and you have to be 25 to rent a
car you can click the minimum age is 25
here but most of the time we're just
going to leave it at 18 now excluding
custom audiences if you're running a
specific campaign your store has been
going for a while and maybe you're
running running a campaign and it only
would make sense to show it to people
that haven't purchased yet with that
pixel data that you've collected you can
put together a group that says everyone
that's purchased in the last 365 days
and then you could throw that in here if
you want to advertise to everyone that
hasn't purchased from you in the
beginning you don't want to do this uh
it's great for like retargeting
campaigns and things like that but right
now we don't need to mess with this
languages up to you uh depends on you
know the language that you are running
uh your product to and also the
countries a great example actually is if
you're running a product um let's say an
Italy but you don't have Italian
advertisements then you can choose the
language as English and it'll show it to
people that have their Instagram and
Facebook accounts set in English this
actually can be a pretty nice tool if
you're uh advertising internationally
now we have Advantage Plus audience as
the next step so they're automatically
going to show ads to people that are
most likely to respond Facebook's
algorithm is very very powerful and
they're really really good at
identifying people that are most likely
going to purchase I recommend running
broad targeting if you're not familiar
after iOS 14.5 update Apple basically
lets Facebook collect less data the
pixels got pretty bad and then Facebook
had to essentially build all of their
data back up again and it's really
really good right now so pretty much
every social media platform I recommend
running broad audience targeting but if
you want to you can do a suggestion and
you can say you know specific age groups
specific gender if that makes sense for
your product and then detail targeting
if you're selling a coffee machine you
can plug in Starbucks here people that
have an interest in Starbucks but again
I don't recommend doing this as
counterintuitive as that sounds it's
just better right now to run broad just
just trust me on this one now now going
down to placements this is where you can
choose where to run your advertisements
right now it's on Advantage Plus but you
can do manual so manual you could say
only on Facebook and only on Facebook
video or Instagram but only on Instagram
stories you can choose these options
here I just leave them wide open
Facebook knows where to send it they're
just really good at that but for some
specific reason if you want to only run
it on Instagram that's how you're going
to do that so we're going to leave this
one on Advantage Plus and a lot of
people also ask me about the estimated
daily results on the right side here
they're like oh it said I'm going to get
43 conversions for $25 that's awesome
and then they get zero don't listen to
this like at all really it's just made
up stuff by Facebook to make you want to
spend more money I guess the only thing
that matters is when you start running
your campaign in the metrics that you
get back so now we're done on the ad set
level we're going to be moving on to the
ad creative level so the same thing with
the previous two we need to name our ad
set so if we were doing three different
marketing angles like the example I had
earlier with the Jade roller you could
do one for skin redness and then the
other two we can set up later and
duplicate and below that is the
partnership ad option so if you don't
know what it is it's a partnership with
a a Creator or another business and
basically you can run your
advertisements from their account so
you've probably seen ones like Kevin
Hart where he is running an
advertisement from his account because
he's paid to do it but it converts at a
better rate because he's a celebrity and
people trust him that's how those
partnership ads work you're probably not
going to do them in the beginning unless
you've got a Rolodex of influencers
ready to promote your product but we're
going to leave this off for now now
under identity is we're going to sign it
to the Facebook page and the Instagram
account if these didn't show up here
then you're going to have to reconnect
them again just essentially by logging
in and assigning the accounts to this
specific ad account if you did it
correctly in the beginning you're
probably going to see your Facebook
account that you just created and your
Instagram account as well so these are
actually really important to set up and
make sure they're linked properly
because if you're running an ad from
your Instagram account if they click on
your profile when they see your ad it's
going to take them to your Instagram
profile where then you can show them
that you're a real brand and you can
also hopefully get them as a follower
that's how you're going to kind of semi
organically grow your following and
actually works really well the fastest
I've grown in Instagram just through
paid advertising was in one year I went
from zero followers on the brand account
to over 55,000 followers on Instagram
and that was all just running paid
traffic on Instagram I didn't do
anything else so it's really really
important that you do that now scrolling
down below that we've got our ad set up
so we want to create our ad a manual
upload because we're not doing the
catalog now we have our format for our
ads we've got flexible single image or
video Carousel or collection flexible I
don't like doing they usually kind of
screw it up single image or video is the
best or Carousel I really really like
Carousel ads right now especially for
image ads if you don't know carousels
are the ones where you can swipe
multiple times and there's multiple
images of different products or the same
product in different use cases running
Carousel ads as images performs really
really well for me if you want to just
do a single image or video that's also
fine this is totally up to you but a fun
fact is that image ads are three times
cheaper on average than video and
they're a lot easier to make but what's
interesting to me is that these
platforms are so based on videos
nowadays Tik Tok Instagram reals
Facebook videos a lot of people don't
post that many images so images almost
are the scroll stopping things now they
kind of stand out more it's totally up
to you what you want to do but I like
cranking out image ads really quickly a
little tip here is the software that I
use to create like 10 image ads an hour
is creative OS on here there's a massive
massive library of AD templates from the
biggest brands in the Ecom space so if
you like this viori ad you can just
click copy into canva or figma and then
you'll get that exact template that
they're using and it'll look like this
then you have a template that's fully
editable with your own copy an image and
you're just copying the exact same
layout they have on their winning ad I
absolutely love using it and they also
have email templates as well as landing
page templates which is super super cool
and helpful if you're bad at design I
check that out if you want to use them
for any of the templates but going back
to the setup we're going to run a single
imager video you can leave multi-
Advertiser ads checked on or off that is
up to you it's your ads are going to
appear alongside other advertisers so
you might see your ad alongside just a
different business it can be a good
thing it can be a bad thing take that
with the greatest salt you're going to
get cheaper metrics in terms of reach
and things like that if you do multi-
Advertiser ads but sometimes it can hurt
you if maybe it's with a competitor so
this one is kind of up to you I'm just
going to leave it on for the sake of
this example now scrolling down below
that is where you're going to put the
website so whatever place that you want
them to land on after they click your ad
you need to put here if you're brand new
to advertising don't put your homepage
you want to put the landing page to the
product you're advertising you don't
want them to go on your homepage and
have to go find the product that they're
looking for that they saw in the ad you
you want to make it as seamless as
possible so we'll just drop it in here
we're going to shop Lululemon just make
sure that your link is correct uh do a
preview URL to make sure it's uh
transferring properly display link you
can actually change what the link says
on your advertisement if your link is
really ugly or really long or something
like that then you can change that here
now going down to browser add-ons uh we
don't need to do any of these unless you
want them to if you want them to have a
called action button to give you a phone
call go for it but I think you're
probably doing Ecom so we're going to
leave that at none now moving down to
the ad creative this is where you upload
your image or your video so let's upload
an image ad it'll take you into this
creative setup where you can choose the
primary text the headline and
description this is what's going to show
in the text and copy locations of your
advertisement so on Facebook or
Instagram you know Square feeds you can
see some writing underneath it and above
it this is where you're going to change
all of that I'm super lazy and not
creative so I just go on drop out I plug
in my product emphasis then I grab some
marketing angles skimmable header maybe
a short skimmable message stack generate
some ideas and they'll generate it for
me and I'll just kind of copy and past
them in here they'll put that in the
primary text headline uh play with retro
style it's pretty good and then maybe a
description here I'll grab this one as
well and pop that right in there and
then you can obviously you know massage
these to however you want and what kind
of marketing angle you're running but
just keep them on the shorter side and
easier to read and really emphasize why
they should be clicking on your
advertisement now our call to action
we've got a bunch of different options I
personally always do shop now I'm trying
to sell a product I don't want it to say
learn more like why would I learn more
about Lululemon shorts most of the time
people are clicking out to the shop and
they sometimes can feel duped if you say
like apply now which just kind of
misleading so I always recommend doing
shop now especially if you're running
Ecom products so once you fill those out
we'll hit next and now we got to grab
our images or our video that we wanted
to use so you probably are not going to
have any on your account so what you do
at the top right is upload your ad
creative you just click on upload and
then grab the file drop it in here and
it'll pop up right here I'm just going
to choose this one and hit next I'm
going to leave enable flexible media on
just to make sure it works correctly and
then you can see the format so when it's
a square you want to leave it as like
original if it's it's a vertical one if
you do 9 x 16 it's going to be zoomed in
so make sure that nothing is cropped off
or you can just leave it as a square
which is totally fine to do by the way
and then horizontal same thing it's
going to be cropped in or original you
can optimize your images uh to make them
fit each one respectively but most of
the time it's going to be square or
vertical that you're going to want to
optimize for once you've got that
uploaded we're just going to hit next
now there's a bunch of enhancements that
they try to add onto it so you can add
overlays catalog items visual touchups
text improvements uh image animation all
these things here I don't really like
them like I don't want my image to be
like animated necessarily you know you
can let them do it for you I just think
the creative is so important to your
advertisement in general that I like to
have full control of it personally
totally up to you though if uh you're
confident in their enhancements but for
me I'm going to leave these off and hit
done so now you're going to see on the
ad preview on the right side we've got
our copy we've got our image that we're
running and these are what the ads are
going to look like in the respective
categories so this is desktop this is
the square format and then this is the
vertical like Instagram stories this is
what it's going to look like so always
make sure you take a look at these ad
pre previews to make sure that your
advertisement looks nice now scrolling
down we've got all of our primary text
already filled out same with our
headline and our call to action under
the info labels you can add things like
a number of page likes to highlight if
you've got a really big page that you're
advertising from or free shipping you
can also highlight promotions that you
might be having if you have a promo code
going on down to the Advantage Plus
creative section uh it's going to want
you to add those enhancements that we
just talked about when we uploaded the
image which is like those moving pieces
and uh the filters and things like that
you can apply this again if you want to
uh I'm not going to event details if you
are running an event uh this would show
up here languages it'll automatically
translate your ad for them which is kind
of nice but also can translate super
weird so it's kind of risky to use it
then we're going to go down to tracking
so this is going to be pre-checked off
for our website events our pixel should
be here mine's not active this is an
example and then below that is offline
events uh we don't need to do that as
well but something that is really
important that I love adding is URL
parameters so what these parameters do
is they add strings of text onto the end
of the link for you when you build it
out it's actually pretty easy to do so
the campaign Source you can choose the
site Source name campaign medium which
you can choose as placement your
campaign name campaign content is going
to be your ad name I'd select those off
and hit apply and so what it does it
adds the line of text at the end of your
link it's really really nice to use to
dive even deeper into your analytics so
what happens is if someone sees and
clicks on your ad on Instagram stories
it's going to add the extra lines of
text on the back end it's going to tell
you that it came from Facebook it's
going to say that it came from the
medium of story click which is the
placement and then it's going to tell
you which campaign name it came from and
the content aka the ad name so to break
this down even further if someone
clicked on a story ad here and they made
a purchase I would know that it came
from Facebook Stories and I also would
know that it came from the ad skin
redness now this is really really
helpful because on your Shopify store
for example you can go into your reports
and you can look at these URL parameters
so even when you see on Facebook you
have five sales and then on Shopify you
might have seven and then you're
thinking well they didn't track two of
them so I don't really know where it
came from you can go on Shopify and you
can see these URL parameters and then
manually attribute them yourself and
that's really important because Facebook
does not track sales 100% of the time
like I was saying if Facebook is showing
five sales and Shopify is showing seven
and on Facebook it's showing two on one
creative two on another and one on the
last one but when you check on your
Shopify reports you can see that
actually two more sales came in for the
last one making it three sales and that
can really make or break your decision
making because you might have thought
that that one was the one that's
underperforming but actually you got the
most sales so that is super important to
always add onto your ad creatives now
that's the last option here and it's
pretty much set up but if I was going to
run in which I recommend doing three
different marketing angles for the same
product we want to do skin redness and a
couple other ones all this is already
filled out so we're going to actually
just duplicate it and then we're going
to leave it in the original campaign and
now I've got skin redness copy so I'd go
back up to the top here and I'd say uh
fine line and wrinkles that's the angle
we're going to be running I would change
the creative to one that represents fine
line and wrinkles and how our product
solves it and then I'll would also
change the primary text to you know
emphasize that it fixes fine lines and
wrinkles more you can just duplicate it
again and add your next marketing angle
and in theory the more marketing angles
that you have and the more creative that
you're testing the better which is why I
love using image ads cuz it's so fast to
create these ads and you can just crank
them out so quickly and they're also way
cheaper to run than video if you're just
testing a product so we could put this
one as acne for the last example but if
you have like 10 of these and they're
all completely different marketing
angles for the same product I guarantee
you that one of them is probably going
to be working better than the others and
that's going to give you a good
indication of who your core audience is
that loves your product the most now
once all of those are uploaded you are
ready to go we filled out everything
that we possibly needed to on this
campaign here and it's ready to launch
so if you're confident everything is set
up your Shopify store or whatever
platform you're using is ready to go
what you're going to do now is just hit
publish it's going to go into a review
process which can take either 10 minutes
or 48 Hours it'll come back either
rejected or approved if you're selling
something that is not allowed on
Facebook it'll come back rejected and
tell you why but most of the time it's
going to get approved ads are going to
start running now congratulations your
first ad is set up and you are running
it now you're waiting for the metrics to
come in you're waiting for the spend to
start kicking in but once it does you
have to learn how to read these metrics
now I'm going to cover some of the most
important metrics that you should be
looking into don't skip this part
because this is super super important
how you understand your metrics you'll
see your campaign here that you just set
up delivery is going to be on and it's
going to start spending some money you
can look at your metrics in the same way
that you set up your ad campaign so
there's metrics on the campaign level
there's metrics on the adet level as
well as the ad creative level if you set
up your campaign exactly the same way I
did just now you're going to want to be
looking at the metrics on the ad
creative level to see which angle or
creative that you're using is performing
the best and you can obviously view this
by week uh month day year whatever you
really want to on the filter section
here so this is the most common setup
we've got our delivery we've got our
adset name bid strategy budget all that
stuff now the most important things are
the results reach Impressions cost per
result the quality rankings are also
really important you can change the
column layout however you want and you
can add metrics in here you can do a
custom column I like to do and the most
common is just kind of performance and
clicks where you can see link clicks
your cpms and all these things so let me
break down the most important metrics to
look for the number one important metric
no matter what it costs to advertise and
show your product to a thousand people
the only thing that truly matters is
your cost per result in theory you could
have a $5 cost per click and have a $5
cost per result $5 cost per click seems
high but you have 100% conversion rate
so that's great who cares that's the
number one thing that you should care
about especially in the beginning but
it's also going to give you some good
metrics on how many people it's reached
the frequency is also super important so
if you don't know what the frequency is
it's how many times your ad has been
shown to the same person twice or more
on average so if your ad has been seen
by a thousand people and they've only
seen your ad once your frequency is
going to be one if it showed your ad to
a th000 people and on average everyone's
Senor ad twice you're going to have a
frequency of two historically for me
over the last 6 years of running Ecom
Brands once my frequency starts passing
above two I see a lower conversion rate
so less people purchasing and the cost
going up because so many people have
already seen that ad so many times and
they're not clicking on it anymore and
that's where the term ad fatigue comes
into play so if your frequency is really
high your ads kind of get worn out your
conversion rate drops your cost goes up
and that's when you need to refresh your
creatives you need a new spin on it a
new image a new video whatever it may be
so in the future if you're making a ton
of money and all of a sudden your ads
start performing really poorly check out
the frequency and also refresh your ad
creatives now some other important
metrics to be looking at are the
rankings the quality rankings the
engagement and the conversion rate after
a couple days Facebook will give you
some ratings and they're actually really
really important and pretty overlooked I
would say so quality ranking is just
that it's your ad relevance what's the
quality look like of your ad Facebook
measures all this and gives you a rating
if it's below not good if it's above
average great if it's average it's okay
your engagement ranking is the way that
people interact with your ad does it get
a ton of likes a ton of comments a bunch
of shares or does no one like comment or
share on it it's going to compile that
data and the feedback and then give you
a rating here as well below average or
above obviously your goal is to be above
average in all these categories next is
your conversion rate ranking so how
often people are converting from your ad
is it above the industry standard or
below that's going to show up here as
well and why these are so important is
because I see a lot of people saying you
know my cpms or my cost per thousand
Impressions which I'll talk about in a
second are super super high my link
clicks are really high as well what's
going on there's a huge market for this
the first thing I say is look at your
rankings if you have a below average
below average and below average Facebook
actually penalizes you and it actually
costs you more to advertise if it's
above above above then you're going to
get cheaper cost per purchase higher
quality audience and it's going to be
cheaper to advertise in general having
these above average is really really
helpful and if you can nail that that's
awesome if they're all below I would
definitely just stop that ad and start
working on a new creative that is not
maybe scammy or poor quality and has
zero engagement so one of the first
things that you should do when you're
looking at your metrics after a few days
is check out these rankings now moving
on to Impressions this is the number of
times that you're add was shown on a
screen pretty straightforward now your
cpms is your cost per thousand
Impressions this is pretty much a vanity
metric a lot of people ask about it why
are my CPM so high it cost me $100 to
show my ad 1,000 times that's pretty
expensive it is but it's also pretty
much dependent on the niche and how
large your audience size is and your
rankings for example if you're selling a
product like a fly fishing rod and
there's only 20,000 people in America
that go fly fishing your cpms are going
to be higher there's not that much ad
space they have to be online on Facebook
on Instagram and they have to be able to
be shown if you have a product that
everyone uses like water then your cpms
should probably in theory be lower cpms
can represent the niche and how large
the audience is but they also can be
impacted by your quality rankings if
they're all below average your cpms
might be higher than they should be keep
that in mind it's kind of like an
indicator that something might be wrong
if they're really really high for your
Market but don't really pay too much
attention to it if you are making sales
and it's converting well and your cpms
are high you can always try to improve
it by getting better rankings later on
then we've got our link clicks so how
many times people have clicked on the ad
our cost per the link click and our link
click through rate the cost per link
click is kind of similar to your cpms
what do the cost cost to get one click
on your website you want this to be
lower but you also want it to be
converting you don't want 100 clicks at
$10 a click and no one's purchasing that
just doesn't matter then you're just
getting a bunch of traffic and not
converting things like CPM and your
click through rate which is the
percentage of Impressions that received
a link click those you're going to have
to kind of learn over time and you can
always just try to improve them later on
with new ad creatives an example is if
your ad is performing well and you're
profitable but your link click seems a
little high let's try to get that down
let's try to get a stronger call to
action let's make people want to click
on the app and just optimizing your
creatives later on down the road for
that and that should naturally drop the
better creatives that you put out there
those are kind of the most important
ones to be looking at once you start
getting your data coming back in keep in
mind that the metrics are kind of just
Clues they're all just pieces of a
puzzle that are indicating that
something might be wrong with your
website maybe it's your ad creative
maybe people just hate the product in
general but what it's doing is giving
you a right direction to look at least
and solve this problem and if you can
read and understand these metrics
correctly you are going to be able to
modify them and kind of massage all the
pieces together create new ad creatives
until everything fits and you turn
profitable now let's say you go through
this whole process and you are
profitable and you want to spend more
money and scale it up what you can just
do is duplicate that same campaign or
your same ad set create a second line
item essentially doubling your budget or
if you want to increase it even further
because it's performing really well you
would just duplicate and then change the
budget on that duplication so instead of
25 let's say it was crushing it at 25
let's try 250 now you're going to be
spending 250 plus the 25 original daily
so that's the step step-by-step process
on how you're going to set up your first
campaign I hope that this video was
