# How to Create AI UGC Ads That Get 3.8x ROAS

# Category: meta-ads

Stop. Look at these video ads that are
made for my drop shipping store.
>> I thought it was another gimmick, but I
finally tried this robot rehab glove for
stroke hand recovery, and I used it at
home for about 10 or 15 minutes a day.
>> Guys, I've been testing the Quad Rhino
for 3 weeks now. 24K carbon,
antiibration tech, and this sweet spot,
massive.
>> We pulled hundreds of people and asked,
"What's your dream hair look at home?"
And we created the perfect tool to make
it happen. Now, you might think that
these are influencers that have paid
$500 to film these video ads. And the
thing is, they're not. These AI UGC
creators that you just saw in those
video ads were made only using
artificial intelligence. And the crazy
part is these AI video ads are
performing better than video ads that
I'm running with real humans on my own
Facebook accounts. As you guys can see,
this is inside of one of the ad
accounts. Checkouts initiated, add to
carts, website checkouts. And you can
see here the most important one, CTR, so
the click-through rate. And you can see
that we're getting 5%, 2.5%, 2.2%. Look
at how good the CTR is for some of these
creatives. These are outperforming real
content creators. Now, it's not just me
that's witnessing these crazy results.
There are other brands out there that
are crushing it with AI creatives. So,
if you're watching this and you run a
drop shipping store and you're paying
influencers to create content, then that
stops today. Now, before we get into the
video, guys, there is a like goal for
this video and it's only a,000 likes.
And when you [music] guys see the amount
of value that I'm about to drop in this
video, the like goal is more than
deserved. Now, make sure you go and
destroy the like button because once we
hit the like goal, there'll be a present
in the pin comment and in the
description below. Now, before I show
you guys how to create AI content
creator step by step, I want to go over
the economy of what AI content creators
are and why they are so powerful. So, as
you guys can see on the screen, this
myro board that I've made for you guys
is actually insane. Look at how big and
in-depth this Myro board is. I am
confident to say that there is no one
else on YouTube teaching you how to do
this in this much detail. I am confident
of that. So, for that reason, guys, if
you haven't already, smash the like
button. Now, I put together this fancy
diagram that says why if you don't use
AI, you will be left behind in 2026 when
it comes to content creation for ads.
Now, before AI existed, everything was
manual. You needed a physical product in
the hand. You needed video editors to do
it all for you, and you needed
filmmakers to do the content creation.
The product testing timeline was one
week, and that's at the best point. So
for you to get the product to the
influencer or to the content creator, it
would take around about a week to get it
all back to you edited. And again,
that's on best case scenario. And this
would cause testing limitations when it
comes to creators. Now, if you don't
already know this, then the new Facebook
Andromeda update is all about content
creation and creative mass testing. So
you can see here testing limitations.
Back in the old days before AI, you
would die because you'd only be able to
test one to three angles and two to five
creatives at max. and that's at best.
Now, this guy over here would not last
in today's economy. Then we move on to
the early AI video era where AI videos
existed, but they weren't really usable.
Mostly robotic voiceovers, bad facial
expressions, poor lip syncing, unnatural
movement, and skin tones. Tools were
expensive and limited and so hard to use
as a beginner. Then we move on to AI
today and the future. The key part here,
guys, is the future. AI ads are nearly
indistinguishable from real video ads if
you do it correctly. So, I'm going to be
showing you how to do it so that they're
very hard to tell whether they're real
or they're AI. Human faces, natural limp
sync, natural movements, and real skin
tones and gestures. Now, this is where
things get crazy. The way you can now
speed test creatives and products
because you can massproduce between 50
and 100 creatives very easily with this
method. And the truth is, if you don't
use AR video ads in 2026, you're going
to struggle because of the new Facebook
Andromeda update, which is all about
speed, volume, and creatives. How many
creatives can you get out there every
single week? And AI allows you to do
that at very good scales. The truth is,
guys, you can't compete with AI. You
can't compete on the speed, the volume,
and the cost. Imagine the cost of
getting 50 to 100 creators to make you
content. It would cost tens of thousands
of dollars and it would take weeks and
weeks to manage it. And this is real
talk from a drop shipper and an
e-commerce brand owner that's been
around since 2017. So, I've seen this
whole industry change till now. And I
know that if I don't adapt with this,
then I'm going to die. So, if you're
watching this video and you're skeptical
about making AI video ads, I'm hoping
that this section now allows you to
understand that you can't keep pushing
this away and not relying on it. And the
truth is, these AI models are only
getting better and smarter. So
eventually the diminishing returns
between real humans and AI videos are
going to be very small. So guys, before
we get into the next part of today's
video, I wanted to hit you with a very
important message as we're about to go
into 2026. I still see it today. Most
beginners are still approaching drop
shipping and e-commerce all the wrong
way. They find a product, they build a
Shopify store, they create some ads, and
they run them on Facebook or Tik Tok.
And they've completely forgot about the
most important part of the process,
which is understanding who your market
is, how you can sell to them, what are
their triggers, and how you can relay
all of that into your creatives, your
store, and your messaging. And that is
literally why 99% of drop shippers fail.
And this is another reason why I've just
relaunched e-commerce mentoring again
for the public. So, every single one of
you guys can apply to join our
one-on-one mentoring. You heard that
correctly. Not group mentoring, no video
course. This is one-on-one mentoring.
[music] And here are the facts, guys.
We've been offering mentoring since
2019. So, we've been around longer than
most of the guys that you see today. Lot
of skill is improve. I I don't know
nothing about that. I just thought first
like you can just design a store and
launch that. That's it. Now I know what
is the strategy how you can go deeper
and deeper and for the money I make some
money from that store too.
>> How much did you make if you don't mind
me asking so far? How many sales have
you got so far?
>> I have a like 21 order and around I
think 1,500.
>> We actually shut it down over a year ago
because we thought you guys don't need
one-on-one mentoring anymore because the
YouTube content, the type of information
you can learn today on this channel is
more than enough. But I was completely
wrong. the amount of people that have
reached out since then saying, "I need
one-on-one mentoring. I need so much
help." And we've reviewed the issues
they're having with their stores. This
is the reason why we're relaunching it
now. Now, the best part is we're
relaunching it, but we're making it even
better because inside of the mentor,
we're actually going to teach you the AI
tools and strategies that we're using
every single day for our own drop
shipping stores. So, you're not only
going to be learning how to do drop
shipping and e-commerce correctly, but
you're going to learn the insiders
information, how we're using AI to try
and automate most of our stores, which
means we're going to remove human error
from the process. So within the
mentoring, you're going to learn how to
find actual winning products based on
data, how to find marketing angles,
understand the triggers and the
audience, creating a Shopify store that
converts, then creating the angles in
the creatives that work so that when you
launch them on Facebook ads, you're
going to get good hook rates, you're
going to get good click-through rates,
and you're going to have higher chances
of seeing success. Now, this one-on-one
mentoring is a six-week process, and
it's intense. It's real one-on-one
mentoring. It's no BS fluff like other
gurus sell online. So, if you're ready
in 2026 to take your drop shipping or
e-commerce journey seriously because
you're looking for a way to escape,
whether it be your 9 to5, get more time
back, make more money, then this is the
best opportunity for you to learn. Now,
the bad news is there's only a few spots
available and then we're going to have
to close the mentoring down again for
the next few months. So, what I'm trying
to say to you guys, it's a first come,
first service, and it's a very small
amount of students that we teach. That
way, we can keep our track record very
good. So, if you're interested in
learning from the best of the best and
the best track record in the history
when it comes to students, you can apply
using the link below. You need to simply
fill out the type form, make sure you
fill it out correctly and you provide
the correct and real information. With
that being said, guys, remember you can
apply using the link in the description
below or you can visit
e-encommercementoring.com.
With that being said, guys, let's get
back into the video. So, just to quickly
summarize this guys, I don't want you
left over here because if you are, then
you're not going to survive. I don't
want you over here either. I want you
here. I want you guys to now adopt the
new level of AI video ad creation. And
I'm confident by the end of this video,
you're going to know how to do it
exactly. I'm not going to be teaching
you the basic stuff. I'm going to be
showing you all the advanced highle
things that the biggest ecom brand
owners are doing. Now, let's move on to
how to create your customer avatar and
script. So, now we're getting into
making the AI creatives. Now, the good
news is, guys, I can't make this any
easier for you to follow because look at
this step-by-step guide I've done in
this Myro board. It is so easy to
literally copy and paste this workflow
into your own e-commerce and drop
shipping stores. So, this is the product
that I'm going to be using. It's the
rehabilitation robot glove for the
elderly people to help their hands if
they have arthritis. So, this is the
product. Now, the reason why I chose
this product is because it's very hard
for AI to get this right. Now, the more
advanced and complex the product looks
and features, the harder the AI is going
to be to recreate it. So, I'm really
putting the AI to the test now by giving
it this product because look at how hard
it would be to try and replicate this
product. And the truth is, guys, the
harder the product is, the harder the
AI's job is. But the good news is I'm
still going to show you how good the AI
can make the videos. Now, if you've got
more simple products, then your AI is
going to be the best quality possible.
So, this is the product that I'm going
to be using throughout the video. Now,
let me talk about the only converting ad
script that you need to use. It's called
PAS. Now, what does this stand for?
Problem, agitate, and then solution.
Now, why does this work? People don't
care about your product at first. Now,
they only care about their problem. So
the PAS works because it calls out the
problem, makes them feel the pain, then
presents your product as the relief and
the better outcome that they want in
their life. And it builds trust and it
removes doubt and a clear call to action
to guide them. And you can turn
attention into action naturally. So it
doesn't feel like a forced type of sale
or it doesn't feel like you're trying to
sell them something. Because the truth
is, humans hate it when they're being
sold to. It's like when you walk into a
shop in the mall and somebody comes up
to you trying to bug you and say, "Do
you need any help? Do you need any
help?" every two seconds. That is
frustrating and humans don't like it.
And that's why this method works the
best. Now, step one to creating our
video script is you want to go to Amazon
and you want to find a listing on Amazon
that has a decent amount of reviews for
your product. Now, you might have to
keep scrolling till you find some. Now,
this one's got the most. It's got 65
reviews. Now, the truth is the more
reviews the better. So, for example,
this product here has got 10,000
reviews, but it's not the same product
as I'm selling. So, the best option I've
got here, guys, which is this one here,
which has got 65 reviews. So, I'm going
to use this one. You need to double
check that it's the exact same product.
Now, usually anything that's being sold
on AliExpress is always being sold on
Amazon. You then want to head over to an
AI tool called GenSpark. Now, GenSpark
is a super agent, and I talk about it
all the time, and I use it every single
day. I'm not paid or sponsored by Gen
Spark. I use this every single day in my
businesses because it's a super agent.
It can perform tasks that GBT can't
perform and in my opinion it's a lot
more smarter and powerful and efficient
than GBT. So what you're going to want
to do is you're going to want to come
over here to where it says AI workspace
and you're going to want to use what
they call the super agent. Now the first
thing that you're going to want to do is
paste the link of the Amazon link here.
Then you're going to want to open up the
prompt sheet that I've given you inside
the Myro board. So, inside of the Myro
board, you're going to see a prompt
sheet, which is the customer avatar
research. You're going to want to copy
all of this, and you're going to want to
paste it in just before the link. So,
I'm going to put a comma, and then I'm
going to put the prompt here. And then
you're just going to click send. And
then you can see that Jensen box using
all of its tools, like it's actually
gone to the Amazon listing to read it.
It's now researching all the information
about the product, and you can see in
lifetime what it's doing. So, you can
make sure that it's on the right track.
And now you can see after a few minutes
it's come up with this hyper accurate
customer avatar for the stroke and hand
rehabilitation device. So you can see
it's given out who the age is, what the
gender is, what relationship they have,
all the buyer behavior has been listed
out for me. Now once it's completed that
task, you want to move over to the
second prompt sheet that I've given you,
which is the script prompt. And you're
just going to simply copy it and give it
back to GenSpark. Now, make sure that
Gen Spark complete the task before you
send it because if you don't let it
complete the task that it's already
doing at the start, then the memory
won't save and it won't have all the
information. So, now genox finished
guys. I'm going to put the second prompt
in and click send. And now you can see
UGC video script stroke hand
repilitization device platform Facebook
YouTube and Tik Tok duration 40 45 to 60
seconds. So, the script is is
highlighting the problem in the first 0
to 8 seconds. So, my husband had a
stroke two years ago, and his left hand,
it just doesn't work. Like, he couldn't
button his own shirt, can't tie his
shoes, he needs help with everything.
Now, clearly, this script's talking from
a wife's point of view for her husband.
So, if I don't want that version, I can
say I've put talk from a male's
perspective with these issues. So,
instead of talking for somebody else,
it's talking for the person. So, now you
can see it says here, I had a stroke
when I was 48. Lost all use of my right
hand. I couldn't even tie my own shoes.
Had to ask my wife for help with
everything. I'm not the type to ask for
help, but I had no choice. I didn't have
therapy, didn't have exercise, but after
6 months of insurance cut me off. Then
my daughter found this thing on Amazon.
So, this is where it's made a little bit
of a mistake. It says it found this
thing on Amazon. So, we need to correct
this quickly. So, you can see here I've
corrected it. I put then my daughter
found this thing on Amazon with
quotations.
It should be from brand name. So, you
need to put your brand name here, guys.
So, whatever brand name yours is, you
just need to put it here. My brand name,
guys, is going to be Norohand Rehab. So,
I'm just going to send it to that. And
now, it's going to remake the script,
but for that brand name. Now, you can
see here it says, "Then my daughter
found this thing called Norohand. It's a
hand rehab glove." So, there we go,
guys. The script's been fixed. So,
before you carry on, double check the
script. Now, I fixed that problem. I'm
happy with the rest of it, and it's a
very powerful, emotional video script
that I can use. So now we've got our
video script. We can now create the AI
avatar that's going to read the script.
Now to do this guys, I'm going to be
using the tool called Arc Ads. So you
can come over to Arcads by using my link
in the description and in the pin
comment to get the best deal possible.
Now I use Arc Ads for all of my AI
creatives because it's the easiest
platform for beginners to use and you
don't need to mess around with any weird
settings on your laptop. It's all native
on Arcads. Now, once you've signed up to
Arcads, you can come over to where it
says new project, and then where it says
new project, you you can rename this to
be whatever you want, but for now, I'm
going to put AI avatar. And then once
you've done that, guys, you're going to
see here talking actors, video image, or
see more. You're going to be using the
talking actors option. You're then going
to come over to the filters and you're
going to be using omni 1.5. This is the
best model at the moment for this type
of AI content creation that we're doing
for our video ads. Now for emotion, make
sure it's on auto added and then audio
is going to be text to speech. So make
sure the actor settings look like mine.
You're then going to paste your script
here. Now the important part is guys,
you can't use the whole script for one
actor. So we're going to be breaking
this up into different sections. So you
can see at the bottom you get 400
characters per script. So you need to
segment it out by every 400 characters.
So, if I read this, I can read the end
of the sentence and it makes sense to
end this at that section. So, don't just
copy and paste different sections into
this that don't make sense at the
ending. Make sure you round it up so
that it makes sense when the actor
finishes because if it doesn't make
sense, the video is not going to be
smooth. Now, although you might be using
the same AI avatar, they might be used
in different environments in different
scenarios. So, that's why we're breaking
the script up so that way you can break
them into different scenarios. that way
the video is more compelling. And then
you're going to want to click the add
emotion section. So this basically adds
emotion to the script for you. So now
you can see it's added the emotion for
me. So guys, before we carry on editing
our AI video ads and our custom AI
avatars, I thought I'd bring this
important message to you. As we're
building these AI video ads, we're going
to run them on Facebook ads or Tik Tok
ads. And one of the biggest mistakes
that I see beginners doing is they're
not using email marketing. Now, you're
going to be paying all that money on
Facebook ads, Tik Tok ads. People are
going to come on your website. They're
going to check out and they're going to
abandon their car. Email marketing is
there to protect you from wasting money
on ads. And this is where today's
sponsor, Omnisend, comes in. Now,
Omnisend is the best platform for email
marketing, and it's the same platform
that I've been using now for the last 2
years for my own brands. And as I'm
talking about AI video ads in this
video, Omnisend has AI built in to their
email marketing platform. They have
autobuilt automations for abandoned
cart, welcome series, checkout
initiated, so you can cover all of those
issues where you lose money when you're
spending ads. And you can also customize
the content within the emails using
Omnisense AI. So literally making custom
emails has never been easier before.
Email marketing has the highest ROI,
return on investment from any other
marketing platform. Automated emails
convert at 32% and upward. So those
emails that you can quickly autoell
through Omnis converts at 32% and up.
47% of email revenue comes through
automation. So not creating fancy emails
or campaigns, just strictly through
basic automations that you can literally
do in a few minutes. Now, the good news
with Omnis is you can also do SMS
marketing, which is text marketing. And
text message marketing is up 22%
yearonear. And brands that are using
email and SMS are making between two and
3x every year in revenue. Omnisend don't
charge you any money until you go past
250 email recipients. So, if you're a
brand new brand, you don't have to pay
anything. And if you are watching this
and you're a brand that's doing good
numbers and you're in the DTOC space,
then Omnisen using my link in the
description below will give you 3 months
at 30% off, which you can't get anywhere
else, which is insane. Then what you can
do guys is you can go over to where it
says add actors. You can go over to
create actor and then you can go to
upload. So you can transform a picture
into a talking actor or you can generate
an actor based on a reference image or a
prompt. Now, the best way to do this,
guys, is by opening up another Arcads
tab. And then you're going to be going
to image. You're going to go to filters.
You're going to be using Nana Banana Pro
9 by6. We're going to create an image of
our avatar. And then we're going to go
to where it says describe image. Now,
before we go over to where it says
describe image, we need to upload a
reference image of the product. Now,
this is the best reference image of the
product that I can find because it's a
simple plain image of the product. It
shows a very good angle of what the
product looks like. That way, the AI can
keep it looking natural. So, what you
guys can do is you can download these
images. Now, I've downloaded these
images from AliExpress. You can download
them from either Amazon or AliExpress,
whichever ones have the best quality
images. Then, I can go back over to the
Archads tab. I can upload the reference
image now, which is this one here. I'm
then going to get a prompt that Jensen
Spark's going to make me. Now, what I'm
also going to do is I'm going to get
this prompt guide made from Google. So,
seven tips to get the best from Google
Banana Pro. So, I'm going to copy this
link. I'm also going to give it to Gen
Spark. I'm also going to upload an image
of the reference product again. So, the
reference products this one. So, I've
given Gen Spark this new prompt. I now
need you to make a prompt for Google
Banana Pro to make an AI avatar wearing
my product that I can then turn from an
image to a video. Then, I've submitted
the prompt guidelines from Google. And
then, I've clicked send. So, this is now
going to give us a prompt to generate
our AI avatar wearing the product. So
here's our prompt guys. We've got the
reference image and now we can click
send. So now Arcads is going to create
two variations of our AI avatar as an
image. So this is the first image it's
made of our potential AI avatar which is
an older looking man wearing the glove
on a sofa. So this is a very good image.
So what I'm going to do is download this
image. I can then head back over to the
other tab and go to add actors create
actor and then I can generate it from a
reference image. So, I'm going to upload
the reference image. I've now asked
Jensen Spark for a define your actor to
prompt. So, I can now copy over this. Go
back to Archer Ads and paste it in here.
Now, you don't have to use a prompt,
guys. It's up to you. But now, I can
click generate. And I'm going to do it
without a prompt. And now, you can see
it's literally spat out the same avatar
again. So, I'm just going to select the
one that I like and click select your
avatar. Then, it's going to say what the
actor should do. So, what kind of
expressions it should have. All of that
information we're going to get from Gen
Spark again. Now I just take a print
screen of that section. Go to browse
files, upload the print screen, and then
I just put now this. So you can see here
we've got our prompt. So we're going to
copy this again, go back to Archer Ads,
paste it in here, and then click turn
into a talking actor. And it's going to
tell you how many credits you're going
to use. Click I confirm, and then turn
into a talking actor. And then it's
going to ask you for the voice that
you're going to want to use.
>> Welcome to our cards. I'm one of the
natural AI actors. You can. Hey, you.
Welcome to our cat. Hey, you. Welcome to
our cat.
>> Now, depending on the voiceover you
choose, think about the market you're
going to be selling it to. Now, these
are British voices. So, if I'm targeting
the USA, is it a good idea? We probably
should stick with an American voice. I
like the Victor one. It sounds like an
older man and it sounds like it's good
for the American market. So, I'm going
to click pick voice and then I'm going
to click launch lip sync. And just like
that, guys, it's going to be training
the model. So you can see here up to two
hours it's going to train this actor to
turn into a talking avatar which is
great for us to have. Now sometimes it
can be done a lot quicker than this. But
if you want a custom avatar the best way
to do it is this way. Now if you don't
want a custom avatar to be talking
majority throughout the video and you're
going to be covering up with B-roll,
then you can just pick the actor. So if
you go back to all actors, change it to
male, then you can change it to senior.
You can technically use one of these
actors. Now, in this instance, just to
make things quicker, I'm going to be
using this actor right here. So, now I'm
going to click add actors. And now you
guys can see I've got it here. So, this
is an option if you don't want a custom
AI avatar to speak over the video and
you just want to use a native one that's
already made. There's nothing wrong with
this method, guys. It's up to you. I
showed you both. So, for me, I'm going
to use this method just just because I
can't wait 2 hours for my custom one to
be done. Now, what I can do, guys, is
click send. It's going to check my
content and now it's going to create
that avatar into speaking about my
product in those emotions. We've already
got our avatar made and ready and it's
going to come back to us within around
about 3 to 5 minutes. Now, we need to
create B-roll to go over the video. So,
as the video is going to be made of our
AI avatar talking of the product, now
obviously this is only one section of
the script. So what we need to do is we
need to get this to be made again for
the rest of the script. So remember
guys, only 400 characters were being
used in that video. So technically we
need to add the second part of the
script. Choose the same actor again to
pronounce the script or to read the
script. And we need to make sure that we
have him saying the whole script. And
again, the great thing about this is you
can change the emotion for every scene.
So when you click add emotion, every
scene for the 400 characters is going to
be different. That way it looks more
natural and realistic. So just to show
you guys again, I'm going to get my
script. So the first part of the script
ended here. So now the next part of the
script that I'm going to grab is from
here. And I'm going to finish it here,
guys. So I'm going to copy this part, go
back to Arcer Ads, paste it here, copy
it from there, and then I'm going to
paste it here. And then I'm going to
click add emotions. Then I'm click add
actors. Then we've got the same actor
again
>> to arad.
>> So now I can click add actor. And then
what I can do guys is click send again.
So that's the second part of our script
done and it's with the new emotion to
that part of the script. Then I would
finish it off with the last part of the
script. And then that's my AI actor
done. Now if I really wanted to guys, I
could add the script in again, add
actors and choose a different actor. I
could choose a doctor. I could choose
somebody else. But for this one to look
more realistic, I'm sticking with the
same actor throughout the video. Now
we've got that bit out of the way. We
now need to create the B-roll that's
going over the top of the actor
speaking. So the actual visuals they're
going to be seeing throughout the video.
Now the B-roll is actually, in my
opinion, more important because that's
going to express everything more
dramatically. You're now going to want
to open up the second tab from Arcads
where we're making our images. And
you're going to want to go back to image
again. Make sure it's on Nana Banana Pro
9 by6. You're going to want to upload a
reference image. Now, this reference
image will be a cutout from the video of
your avatar. So, as you guys can see
here, I took a print screen of when my
AI avatar was talking because we're
going to be using this as a reference
image to create another image of him.
And then we're going to turn that image
into a video. I know this is a little
bit long-winded, but if you want the
best results, this is how to do it.
We're then going to go back to Arcer
Ads. We're going to upload the reference
image which is of our screenshot of our
avatar from the video. Then you want to
go back to Gen Spark and say this is my
script. Make sure you send it your
script again, the new revised one after
you checked it. And then at the end
you're going to put I need you to make
me some image B-roll clips using Google
Banana to make B-roll images and
prompts. Now once you send it that it's
going to give you a prompt list to give
to the new images that we're going to be
making with Arcads. So here guys, I'm
going to paste my prompt.
And then what I'm going to do is click
send. So you can see here as well guys,
these are the prompts that it's made.
It's given me loads of different prompts
for the video. And because you've given
it the full script, it knows what
prompts to make for which part of the
video. I'd recommend that you read these
prompts and just make sure you're happy
with the B-roll. Do you think it's going
to help portray the product? Show off
the emotions, show off the exaggeration
of why they need your product. So don't
just copy and paste. Make sure you read
it and you're happy with the quality of
the prompt. Now, some good news, guys,
is whilst I'm waiting for these images
to be made, we've got the first actors
part of the script being done. So, if I
show it to you here, guys,
you can see it.
>> If you've had a stroke and your hand
just feels dead or it's stuck in this
tight fist you can't open. That was me.
I tried the stress balls, the little
hand exercises, pulling my fingers open
with my good hand.
>> See, that looks really, really good.
Now, when you download it, it's way
better resolution here. They downscale
the resolution. When you export it,
it'll look a lot better. Now, the good
news is, guys, we're going to download
this clip. And don't worry about the
bits that don't look great. We're going
to put B-roll on top to cover it up and
make it look more exaggerated. I can
then go over to Gen Spark, guys. Now,
we're going to be using Gen Spark again
to make the image to video. So, we're
turning these images into the videos for
the B-roll. Now, the reason why we had
to make them as an image first is
because we want to keep the same actor.
We don't want to change the actor in the
B-roll. So, if we go straight to video,
it will change the actor because AI is
not smart enough yet to keep the same
actor without you using a reference
image. So, what we're going to do is go
back to Genparot, click new. We're going
to go over to where it says AI video.
We're then going to use Gemini VO3.1
reference. We're then going to use HD
mode. We're going to change the B-roll
from 3 to 5 seconds to 5 to 10 seconds,
then by 9 by 16, then image to video.
So, we're going to upload the image that
we just saved. We're then going to paste
the prompt here, and then we're going to
click send. Now, because the AI has the
reference image, it's not going to
change the actor. The B-roll will still
be the actor, but now doing something
else that we want it to do to exaggerate
parts of the video. Now, this is the
second image that Archads made me. So,
I'm going to download this image. Now,
if you've not been using Gen Spark in
this video to do anything, an
alternative to Gen Spark to turn it from
image to video is free pick. So, if you
want to use an option where you've not
been using Gen Spark as an option in the
video and you've already paid for it,
then a good alternative is free pick.
Again, you're going to come over to
video generator, Google VO 3.1. You're
then going to paste a prompt here.
You're going to change the resolution to
1080p 9 by6.
sound you can keep on and the duration
I'd keep it at 6 seconds and then you
can upload your reference image and then
you can click use image and then you can
click generate but if you're already
paying for Gen Spark you might as well
just keep using them for the image to
video option so guys here's an example
of the outcome that we got from the
image to video using Gen Spark or
Freepick. So this is the first clip.
So, you see how it's kept the same
actor, but it's exaggerated his emotions
and his experience. We're going to be
using that as the B-roll. And
essentially, what you guys need to do is
you just need to do the same image to
video prompts for all of the clips. So,
if you've got like 14 different or 15
different or 10 different image to
videos, you're going to have to do all
of them. Yes, it can take a little bit
of time, but as long as you go to free
pick and you do all of these, you can do
them very quickly because you can just
quickly add them all in one after one
and just wait for them to process. It
could take around about 10 minutes, but
at least you're not waiting a long time.
Here's another B-roll clip that I got of
the guy's hands being squeezed on the
couch. We're going to be using that a
little bit throughout the edited video.
So, I can download this one. Now,
essentially, once you've got all of your
image to videos done and you've
downloaded them and you've got all of
your AI avatar scripts, in terms of the
AI avatar reading your script, it's
going to be between either two or three
videos or maybe four. Once you've
downloaded all of that content, we can
now edit it and put it all together so
it looks like an actual ad. And by
making sure that you follow all of those
procedures, guys, you'll have an AI
avatar reading your custom prompt script
that's there designed to convert because
it's using the strategy that converts on
ads. You're then going to have B-roll
clips sustaining the same character, but
exaggerating their emotions and using
the product in different environments.
And then we can now edit it and put it
together so that it looks like a
realistic AI avatar that is literally as
close to a human as we can get. Now to
do this guys, I'm using a software
called Cap Cut. It's by far the best
video editing software for beginners to
use. So go ahead and use Cap Cut. Click
create new. Use 19 by6. And then the
first thing that we're going to want to
do guys is dump all of our media in
here. So click upload, upload file. So
just to quickly show you guys how this
is going to work. I've uploaded four
clips here. Now, you're going to have
way more than four clips. You're going
to have the clips from the AI avatar
speaking and then all of your B-roll
clips. I've only added one clip of the
avatar speaking and then just three
B-roll clips. So, I'm going to drag the
first one into the timeline. Now, just
to make sure this is correct, we're
going to play it.
>> If you've had a stroke and your hand
just feels dead.
>> Now, the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to click fill screen. So, just
click that and you'll see a slight
adjustment. Now that way it's filling
the screen
>> or it's stuck in this tight fist you
can't open. That was me. I tried the
stress balls, the little hand exercises,
pulling my fingers open with my good
if you've had a stroke and your hand
just feels dead. So yeah, that is the
right clip, guys. So now we can start
adding our B-roll in. So this is the
first B-roll that I want, which is here.
So I'm going to drag it on top. I'm
going to listen very carefully to what
he's saying so I know the placement is
right. If you've had a stroke.
>> So, if you had a stroke,
>> if you
>> So, I need to place it there.
Now, I need to make sure that this
B-roll clip is muted because if it's not
muted, it's going to look stupid. So,
mute this one.
If you've had a stroke and your hand
just feels dead or it's stuck.
If you've had a
>> So, he's too happy there. So, I need to
cut this clip slightly to where he looks
really miserable.
There. That's perfect.
>> If you've had
If you've had a stroke and your hand
just feels dead.
>> So, here we go.
>> If you've had a stroke and your hand
just feels dead.
If you've had a stroke and your hand
just feels dead.
>> Hand feels dead. So, I'm going to get
the clip of the hand being dead. So,
we're going to drag this into the
timeline.
>> Stuck in this tight. If you've had a
stroke and your hand just feels dead or
it's stuck in this tight just feels dead
or
>> So, here we go. I'm going to mute this
clip.
If you've had a stroke and your hand
just feels dead or it's stuck in this
tight fist you can't open.
>> See, there we go, guys. See how these
B-roll clips are coming together nicely.
So, I'm going to replay that again. If
you've had a stroke and your hand just
feels dead or it's stuck in this tight
fist you can't open.
>> See that guys? We're 6 seconds in. But
the B-roll complements what he's saying.
And now what we can do is we can click
on the AR avatar, click captions. We can
click the main clip here and we can
click captions and we can click auto
captions and generate. That way we're
going to have captions in the video. Now
we can click on presets. And I like to
use either the black one or the yellow.
So, yellow for this video is probably
better because it's more of an alerted
video. So, I'm going to be using the
yellow and black text. Then, I'm going
to make the text bold. And then I can
change the font style.
>> If you've had a stroke and your hand
just feels dead or it's stuck in this
tight.
>> So, now we've got captions, guys, as
well.
>> If you've had a stroke,
>> and you can make these captions look a
lot nicer in your own time. What we can
also do is click on this clip and click
smart tools. So, you can click retouch.
So, this way you can retouch his skin
tones. So there's loads of really good
features within Cap Cut that we can use.
So if we click on the main clip, you got
something called smart tools. So if you
come over to smart tools, you've got
auto refframe, so that way it stays in
the frame. You got retouch if you want
to make him look more natural. So
retouch is really good if you want to
enhance skin tones. So if you feel like
the skin tones aren't realistic, you can
use this and it will make it look
realistic. You can also use relight. If
you feel like the lighting is really bad
in the video, that will fix it. So,
these smart AI tools will enhance the AI
avatar, the actual one reading from the
script if you want to make it look more
professional. Now, what you need to do,
guys, is you need to add all of the
B-roll and the AI avatar scripts in,
fill up the whole timeline, and just
position the B-roll to be correctly
within the video. Now, the good news is
when you're adding all this into the
timeline, you're going to see very
obviously if you have the correct B-roll
for the video. So, you're going to watch
this and be like, "Oh, is the B-roll
right for my video, or have I missed
something out?" And if you've missed
some B-roll out, guess what? This is the
perfect way to know what to add in. So,
if you feel like, "Oh, this B-roll was
missed. I can go back to the image to
video or go and get another image to
then turn into a B-roll clip, but you
now know visually as you're watching
this, oh, I missed this out and I need
to go and fix it." So, by adding all the
clips into Cap Cut, it's going to make
your life easier knowing whether you've
missed something out or you haven't.
Now, I will also leave a link in the
description to a video where I teach you
how to edit these videos professionally
so you can make them look really cool.
There's other content creators out there
that have made amazing videos on how to
edit Cap Cut videos so they look amazing
and they look super realistic. But let
me show you my final result. So, here's
the final edit, guys. And remember, this
is in 480p. For some reason, when I'm
previewing, it's in 480p. But check it
out.
>> If you've had a stroke and your hand
just feels dead or it's stuck in this
tight fist you can't open, that was me.
I tried the stress balls, the little
hand exercises, pulling my fingers open
with my good hand, and honestly, nothing
really changed. It was just stiff and
frustrating, and I felt trapped because
I couldn't do basic stuff. I kept seeing
these rehab gloves online, and I didn't
trust it at first. I thought it was
another gimmick, but I finally tried
this robot rehab glove for stroke hand
recovery, and I used it at home for
about 10 or 15 minutes a day. It wasn't
some instant miracle, but I noticed my
hand felt less tight, my fingers weren't
as stiff, and I could move them without
it hurting as much. And that alone was
huge because when your hand is tight all
day, it wears you down mentally. You're
constantly fighting your own body. Now
it feels like I'm actually doing
something again instead of just waiting
and hoping. I'm working on now. Although
this clip's not perfect. It's just me
quickly editing it. And I used a
variation of cap cut filters,
transitions again, getting extra B-roll
made from image to video or just making
it a video in general. But that's an
idea of what you can get. And obviously
the more time you put in, the more you
learn these skills, the better the
outcome is going to be. But with that
being said, guys, that's how you can
create realistic AI avatars for your
drop shipping or e-commerce stores for
whatever product that you're selling. Do
bear in mind, it does take a little bit
of time to learn and it does take some
time to learn how to do image to video,
the scripts, and using these platforms
that once you learn it all, it becomes a
lot quicker and more efficient. And
remember, AI is only going to get better
and better from here, guys. So, it will
be a lot faster and easier in the
future.
