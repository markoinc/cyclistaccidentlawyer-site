In this video, I'm breaking down the new
way that we're running Facebook ads in
2026 that is absolutely crushing it. Me
and my agency are working with nearly
100 brands ranging from six, seven, and
even 8 figures a month. And in the last
few months, we've all seen Meta
completely change their algorithm. So,
by the end of this video, you'll know
exactly what's changed, the exact
systems that we're using, the features,
the settings that have changed so that
you can copy and paste this into your ad
accounts and your businesses to actually
scale profitably in 2026. So, starting
at the very top here, the most important
thing we need to understand when we're
starting an account or if we're building
on a very large account already is the
core of the account we want to happen in
a single prospecting CBO campaign.
Prospecting CBO when we go inside the
campaign settings is focused on a
campaign budget and typically has a
highest volume or value campaign bid
strategy. There are some cases where
we're running cost per results or bid
caps, but for the most part, highest
volume or value is where we're focused.
We also want to make sure audience
segment reporting are fully set up. This
is something that was introduced two
years ago and I'm still seeing accounts
that don't have this done properly. Now,
inside this prospecting CBO, you'll
notice on my screen here that I have a
whole lot of adsets. We have 68
different packs of adsets, some of which
are paused, some of which are active,
that have run over just this month
alone. The big takeaway that I want
everyone to have here is that every time
we launch new creatives, we launch them
in a new pack. And you can see I
literally name this broad pack 68, new
creatives. I date the exact date that
the creatives were launched. And then we
also add in whether they're videos,
statics, if there's anything special
going on. This is all the way down the
board for every single pack that we
create all year. This creates a hyperco
competitive environment in our ad
account. It forces the ads to compete
against one another so that they fight
for our budget so the best ads rise to
the top, get the most amount of spend,
and get you the most conversions. Now,
here's where the trickery begins. This
is the new versus the old. A brand new
feature that came out in the middle of
2025 that was nowhere near ready to come
out was value rules. And now I'm really
bullish on value rules because they've
gotten better and better in just the
last couple months. Value rules
essentially are a new feature that allow
us to create rule sets for different
optimization systems based on outcomes
that Facebook can't see like lifetime
value. What we have to do to create
these is click create a new rule set and
then we could actually define by
different criteria. And just to give
everyone a very simple example of this,
let's say you know on your back end that
when men buy your product, they're 50%
more likely to come back and buy a
second time versus women who, let's say,
are less likely to come back. So, what
you can do is click on gender here.
Select your gender. In this case, we'll
go men. And we will increase our bid by
that specific criteria to either bid
higher or lower. A fantastic example of
where I'm seeing this work really well
right now is locations, specifically
full countries. This is allowing us to
group together more and more countries
in the exact same campaign and downgrade
the bid. I'll give an example here. If
you're bidding in the United States and
a bunch of other countries, and the
United States being one of the biggest
consumer markets is eating up a lot of
that spend and low on your return on ad
spend, then you could just go ahead and
decrease the bid here by something like
10%. You don't need to listen to my
exact recommendation for 10%, 50%, 90%,
whatever. Just do this in small
increments and see how it impacts your
spend. We have seen this be tremendously
helpful in balancing out our return on
ad spends. This is one of the most
granular rules that goes completely
against the ethos of full automation.
This is great for us advertisers. Now,
the second part of the adset settings
that is fully changed and is completely
changing in both my strategy and
functionality is first Facebook
introduced percentage value. What this
allows you to do is set a as percentage
value maximum or minimum ad set budget.
This is so perfect for CBOS where one
adset is hogging up all the spend cuz
now what we can do is we can change the
daily average maximum or minimum to a
certain percentage. This means that as
we scale, we don't need to worry about
this being a hard number. It'll just be
10% or 30% or 40%. On the contrary,
because this is now available, a lot of
our accounts are having maximums and
minimums. So, we're kind of creating
these little CBOs within the CBO. Now,
the way that we're using this is we're
setting average daily minimums in dollar
values equal to one time the target CPA.
So, if my target CPA is $50, I'm
literally entering $50 in here. We're
only doing this for ranges of seven
maximum 10 days. And then after that,
we're removing this. So, we'll just
literally unselect it like so. And then
allow the campaign to run freely. This
really just ensures that all creative
has a fair chance. I think this is very
helpful. and it's been around for a
while, but now with the introduction of
the percentage on the other side, we
have more toggles to play with, which I
think is very helpful. Perhaps the
biggest addition, which is the single
addition that I am most happy about in
basically all of 2025 heading into 2026.
In April of 2025, Facebook introduces
incremental return on ad spend. Now, any
new adset on the highest volume
strategy, specifically running a
performance goal of maximize number of
conversions, can go down to their
attribution model and click standard or
incremental. If you select incremental,
you'll now see your attribution setting
is incremental. What incremental means
is that it's only focused on conversions
that happened because of Facebook. This
means that it doesn't care about sliding
in at the last second and showing an ad
to someone who is going to purchase
anyway. This is truly a model defined
for acquiring net new customers for the
business. The coolest part is even if
you don't use this strategy like in the
account or campaign that I'm showing
right now, which is using traditional
7-day click one day view, what you can
do instead is go to your columns, go to
compare attribution settings, click
incremental attribution, and click
apply. And once you do this, you're
going to see your drop off in total
number of purchases, which we can see
here is 1,474 to,300,
which is the incremental purchases. This
is a really good ratio that I have in
front of me from nearly 1500 to 1300.
It's a very small drop off from 7-day
click to incremental. Some brands are
going to see a huge huge drop off. And
if you do, that might be one of your
signs to actually run more incremental
conversions on its own as the primary
objective for Facebook. Now, as we move
to the ad level, the big question comes
up. What about Andromeda? Andromeda was
probably the biggest shift in the
algorithm that we've seen in probably
the last 5 years plus. And it makes a
staple point for us to make sure that
we're changing our creative strategy.
And that's exactly why every big brand
in the world is increasing their
creative volume, their total output. You
can see Gap here at the beginning of the
year was running 135 or 145 ads. By the
end of the year, right now, active in
their account, they're running 6,546
active ads. If we go to a brand like
Gruns that was actually known for
running a ton of creative at the
beginning of the year, where they
started the year with,00
active ads, they ended this year at
7,580
active ads. And the craziest part is you
could go down the list and put in any
successful brand and you won't see one
single brand decelerating in creative.
Take Nike for example, was starting the
year at 1,200 ads. They ended the year
at a whopping 23,000
ads. Or Maidwell, who actually just
started the year with somewhere around
6050 ads. At their lowest, they only had
a total of 21 ads active. They ended the
year with 653
active ads. The list literally goes on
and on. You cannot find a single
successful brand that decelerated their
ad volume. And that's because the
algorithm changed. How it used to work
is you would set your audience and you
would select a bunch of creatives that
you want to be delivered to that
audience. You'd usually group that in an
adset or a campaign and then you'd go on
your merry way and know that these
creatives are being attacked or hit on
this audience. But what changed so
drastically with Andromeda is that it
now works in a concept driven way where
you have a single concept which acts as
the targeting mechanism to find the
audience. So instead of having a bunch
of audiences with groups of creatives
like so what you now have is a variety
of different concepts and these concepts
all go out to serve to different
audiences. So what naturally happens is
one concept might be capable of getting
you a 3x return on ad spend at $50,000.
But concept two might be able to get you
a six return on ad spend but only spend
$3,000. And then concept three might
only be able to spend $100, but might
get you a 9x return on ad spend. Now,
old school Facebook would have said, "I
should try to spend more money here. I
should try to spend more money here."
New Andromeda says, "All of these are
valuable. Keep this one active. Keep
this one active. And keep this one
active." As long as your baseline is
over a 3x, allow them all to spend. This
is not a bidding war like it used to be.
So, what are you supposed to do
potentially as a small business owner or
even a medium-sized brand that's trying
to scale rapidly? How could you possibly
compete with something like Maidwell who
went from 50 active ads to 600 or Nike
that went from 1,200 to 23,000? Sounds
absurd. It's actually not too
complicated. It's just a repeated system
that scales in time. Let me show you
exactly how it works. So, the first
thing we need to understand is what is a
concept. What I have on my screen here
is a few examples from Yeti. This is
going to differ from brand to brand, but
I'm hoping I can get that point across
really quickly for you. You can see each
of these three concepts have slightly
varying themes. They might carry the
same fonts, the same offers, but they're
different. They feel different. Think
about it like this. You know for a fact
that there's one of these three that you
individually react better to. I could
tell you very simply concept number two
I would react the best to it where I
don't really react well to UGC and very
boring statics I also don't react too
well to however some people are
different some people actually only buy
by seeing UGC which we have down here
and some people only buy by seeing
products on flats like very boring
backgrounds while each of these vary in
iterations because we have different
iterations the concept is generally the
same and who reacts to A over here
versus B versus C is all going to be
pretty much similar in audience. So our
new job on Facebook is not to constantly
create new concepts which everyone is
saying to do that does not actually
work. Our new job is to find a concept
and when that concept works run it until
the wheels fall off. A concept just like
I'm showing in AB and C here can be
reproduced over and over and over and
over and over and over again. The point
of all of these concepts is that you can
create iterations of these concepts.
They don't need to be massively
different every single time. Anyone
that's telling you they need to be
massively different every single time, I
want to give a really honest warning.
They're probably trying to sell you
creative services. You don't need
different concepts every time. Here's
just straight proof of that. Take the
example we were just using earlier, Made
Well. Do these look like they're
similar? Of course they do. There's
three ads, four ads, five ads, six. The
list goes on and on. They're all
iterations. Every major brand, there's
Nike right here with four right in front
of me, another two, three, these are all
just iterations. And it's not only
acceptable, but it's actually optimal.
This is what I recommend for the
accounts that we run. So, don't think
you need to reinvent the wheel every
single week. Now, what you do need to do
every single week to grow your account
every single week is again not that
complicated. You start with launching
creatives every single week. You wait 7
to 14 days. You just give those
creatives some time. You analyze those
creatives based on incremental
attribution, which we went through
earlier. You brief the winners, meaning
you try to figure out what are the core
components of my winning ads. How can I
create more of them? Just like the
examples I showed you. And then through
an outside source like Magic Brief or
Facebook Ads Library, which are both
completely free for doing this, you
source your competitor concepts. You
steal from your competitors. You think,
"How can I make that for myself?" You
take that template. You take that
concept and you go ahead and you create
a bunch of ads. And then guess what? You
launch that creative and you do that
every single week over and over and over
and over again. That's how you compete
with the biggest brands. Now, if what
I've just shared is opening up your mind
to what's about to happen in 2026, then
I want to advise you on two very
important things. First, the exact
system that I shared with you is what we
do all day every day at the
Moonlighters. So, if you are a fit to
work with us and you actually want to
scale your brand, click down below to
apply. It takes a minute. Worst case,
you take a 15-minute call and we're not
a fit to work together. best case,
you're one of the 100 plus brands that
we've worked with in just the last year
alone, scaling profitably. And two, if
you're not quite at that size where you
need agency level services, I've just
reopened the doors to the Facebook ads
blueprint, which is my paid ads
community in school. This is where you
get access to me, my team, basically all
my friends and resources. You can click
