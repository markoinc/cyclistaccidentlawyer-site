How do you actually scale Facebook ads
in 2026? Well, today we'll be going over
just one of the many accounts that we've
been spending on uh this one particular
account that we've done over $42,000 in
the last 72 days just in ad spend and
specifically how we've been scaling this
ad account up in terms of our scaling
rules when it comes down to the budget
for Facebook ads. So, with that being
said, let's dive right into it. So, this
just lasts 7 days for one of our
clients. And again, you know, if you
you're new to the channel and stuff, we
do one CBO campaign per objective of the
business, per goal of the business. And
that's s right there. So, this campaign
right here that's spent $42,000 over the
last 7 days is for our main hero
product. We have a new product we just
launched. Uh we're testing some other
products in this campaign. But the moral
of the story here is that we have this
one campaign that spent $42,000 last
seven days. It's our main hero product
that we're currently actively scaling.
And you know, we're spending roughly
$6,000 a day on this one particular
campaign. And again, we're doing this in
a CBO campaign. And as far as to scale
the budget, all we do is just increase
or decrease that campaign. We don't
create new campaigns to scale ads. We
don't test new ads and other campaigns.
We keep it all consolidated into one
campaign per goal for the business. So,
as far as like actually adjusting the
budget, all I do is come in and click on
edit on that daily budget right there.
And then I just adjust that 20% up or
20% down. Now, as far as the rules to
and when to adjust that budget, that's
where we're going to go more so over
today. So, let's just first look at
right here. Every single day I look at
the ad accounts and every day I look at
yesterday and I basically ask myself,
hey, did we hit our scaling KPI for this
particular ad account? Now, every ad
account is different. We have some ad
accounts that scale on cost per
acquisition. Typically, our more
experienced brands, brands spending a
couple hundredk a month, uh, they've
been around in business for a while,
they know what they're talking about.
[laughter]
they'll go out their cost per
acquisition, right? Because we're not
really looking at rorowass because we're
focusing more on LTV profitability and
all of those good things. I have some
brands that are somewhat newer, you
know, more early on in their life cycle
and they focus more on rorowass still
and that's perfectly fine as well. And
then some of our brands are like legion
clients and stuff where we focus on CPL.
Long story short, every brand we work
with typically has a different scaling
KPI of a certain cost per acquisition, a
certain rorowass, a certain cost per
lead of which we uh increase or decrease
that campaign based off performance from
here. Once we understand what that
scelling KPI is and sometimes we uh work
with clients who have very unrealistic
ones you know and we have to do a little
bit of damage control there to reset
expectations and stuff like that. But
once there's an agreed upon scaling KPI
of how we decrease or increase budget
then we'll start following this process
right here. And pretty simple you know
did we hit KPI yesterday? If yes, then
we literally just go ahead. We increase
spend by 20%. And then boom, this SOP is
done. Come back tomorrow. So every day
you do this, look at yesterday. If yes,
you increase spend by 20% and you're
done. Now, if we look at yesterday and
we didn't hit that KPI, right? You know
what do we do? We didn't do we just
immediately start dropping budget or
what? Well, the first thing I always
like to say is, have we waited at least
four days for that scaling KPI to be
hit? Too often we'll increase budget and
maybe performance like kind of dips a
little bit and it just doesn't hold that
same level and people will immediately
go and try to pull their budget back way
too fast. Where I find is if we just
hold the budget there for a few days, it
rebalances itself and we're perfectly
fine. If we have not waited four days
for that scaling KPI to be hit, then
it's just basically saying, "Hey, wait
another 24 hours. Scaling SOP complete,
you know, and then we restart that back
over." But if we waited 4 days and for 4
days performance has dipped and we're
just like not hitting the performance we
want, then what I want to look at is are
we at the hard deck? Now, the hard deck
is a number that's going to be different
for everyone. And this number will
change often depending on what stage
you're at of of spending and scaling and
all of those good things. So, the first
thing I like to look at is um let's say,
for example, we're spending $1,000 today
right now. We're profitable and stuff
like that. Then, like I wouldn't want to
just drop all the way back down to zero.
I don't want to keep scaling my budget
down by 20% every day and then, you
know, we're back down to zero in ad
spend because it's be very difficult to
have a large volume of new creatives to
start testing to find something new that
works and scales versus just kind of
holding that budget there to allow us to
test faster. If we are not at the hard
deck, meaning that we're well above this
low set number of ad spin, we never go
below, then what we'll do is we'll
decrease spin by 20%. And then we'll
come back tomorrow and basically repeat
this all over again. Now, if we are at
the hard deck, right, let's say we're
spending $10,000 a day and we don't want
to go below $2 to $3,000 a day in ad
spend because we have a fat bank of
balance and we have plenty to cover us
for the next 30 to 60 days. We want to
hold this so that way we can give
ourselves more ad spend to be able to
test uh new stuff, whether it's
creatives, landing pages, all that good
stuff. Then what I would want to do is
do not decrease ad spin, right? like I
don't want to touch the ad spin if we're
at our hard deck. And the only time
we're going to touch ad spin if we're at
our hard deck is if we get our scaling
KPIs back to where they need to be and
then we can start increasing spend by
20% a day. So this is realistically the
process we follow daytoday for like
basically how to scale Facebook ads and
when to adjust the budget, all of those
good things right there. Uh if you have
any questions around this, drop it below
