# Category: meta-ads

After producing over 10,000 ads that's
tied to 450 million in ad spend, I'd say
I finally cracked the code of writing ad
scripts that always perform. And there's
no secret system. There's just a simple
formula that you follow and ends in a
well-performing ad. So, let's kick
things off straight away with the first
thing that every single good script
needs and that is a hook. A hook works
in a couple of key departments. The
first one is the visual hook. What is
the visual thing happening in the video
that is going to hook the consumer? And
then the script part, the
copyrightiting, what's text is on the
screen, what text is being said in a
voice over. In fact, I've made a video
on exactly that, how you can craft
really great hooks. I go over what makes
a good visual one, what makes a good
audio one. But for the purposes of
script writing, let's just focus on the
actual words.
>> How the leaf thorn is saving people. So,
if you look at this example that we made
for Leaf Shave, the guy says, "How the
leaf thorn is saving people paired with
an image of them holding the product
covered in shaving foam." The reason we
did this is cuz it actually proved
really well in another video where we
had a woman completely covered from head
to toe in shaving cream. So, we did the
same thing here. And then split screen
underneath is them making the foam as
well. So, there's a couple of visual
cues that are going to tie in the
customer here, but then audibly the
actual script, what they're saying,
we're enticing them into the video with
curiosity. People might have no idea
what the leaf thorn is, but they're
intrigued because somehow it's saving
people. The hook is arguably one of the
most important factors of any video ad.
Without a good hook, people will bounce
and they won't ever buy your product.
You are competing for attention on the
feed and everybody wants that attention.
So, the better the hook, the more
relevant the hook is to your customer,
the better chance you have that they're
going to convert. I'd say one of the
best psychological principles to use
when creating a hook is curiosity.
People love to watch something just to
find out what happens. It's the same
reason why if I told you not to think of
a big pink elephant, you're probably
going to think of a big pink elephant.
We have this thing in our brain that
makes us curious and makes us want to
know more information or want to think
about something. And so using that in
your hook is a great way to grab people.
A side note here, when you are making
your hooks, you need to make sure that
they are relevant to your customer. I've
seen people have incredible hook rates,
but the hook is not relevant in the
slightest. And you can tell that by the
hold rate being incredibly low. People
aren't sticking around to watch the rest
of the video. So once we've got the hook
out of the way, the next thing we need
to do is build the body of the script.
One of my favorite script formats is the
villain versus hero. I've spoken about
this a few times on the channel because
it always gives me consistent winning
results and it's essentially when you
show your product as the hero and an
industry or a competitor product or
perhaps even a habit as the villain. For
example, let's say that you are selling
a product that stops people from biting
their nails. Then the villain of the
piece is that urge to bite your nails.
The hero your product that saves the day
because it has stopped you from biting
your nails. That is the script format
we're going to be using. I'm going to be
showing you throughout this entire
video. So, make sure you stick around.
In fact, we use it in this ad here for
leaf shave.
>> Clogged cartridge versus leaf razor.
This is why your razor clogs so much.
The head is so densely packed with
plastic that it leaves no room for foam
and hair to pass through. And this
moisture strip is a gunk magnet. And
it's we're showing a traditional razor
and then we're breaking down why this
razor sucks and why you simply shouldn't
use it. We're displaying traditional
cartridge razors as the villain
>> full of undesirable ingredients. So why
not take all that out, replace the body
with sleek metal and self-insert blades?
Then you'd have the [music] leaf razor
clog test.
>> And then we present the hero of the
piece, in this case, the leaf [music]
razor. And then we even go a step
further because we demonstrate why
cartridge razors are so bad.
>> Leaf [music] rinse test. Leaf efficiency
goes to the leaf razor. break up with
the plastic and for
>> because that's the other part of this
script. Whenever you make some kind of
claim, it's a really good idea to back
it up with some kind of results, whether
that's a medical study or an actual
physical visual test that you can see in
the video like we did here. Because you
can say something to someone, but then
showing it in action, showing the claim
be true is instantly going to make them
feel more confident in purchasing your
product. The important thing to remember
when you're writing these types of
scripts is that when you're talking
about your villain, you need to make
them possibly seem worse than they are.
Let's go back to that nailbiting example
from before. You can do some research
into the side effects that come from
nailbiting and you can say how awful it
is for your health. You can get
infections, you can get hangails, all
these different things because we're
really kind of twisting the knife
essentially. We want people to really
feel hatred for this villain because
then it makes it even more effective
when you swoop in being the hero of the
piece and your product comes to save the
day. Think about any Marvel film that
you've ever watched. They really make
you hate the enemy, the villain. You see
them tearing down Gotham City. You see
them taking someone hostage. They do all
these things so that in your brain you
really hate this villain. But then as
soon as the hero of the piece comes
around, everything changes. You love
Superman. you love Batman because
they're here to save the day. And that's
the exact same thing we want to do in
these scripts. And that I think is
probably one of the reasons why the
script works so well is because it's
something that people don't usually see
in video ads. We're trying to tell a bit
of a story here instead of just trying
to sell them a product. So just to
recap, the core things we have so far is
the hook. That's section one. We need to
grab attention. The next one is to
introduce our villain of the piece and
tell them why this villain is the worst.
Thirdly, we want to introduce your
product as the hero who is here to make
everything way better. The fourth is the
demo. We want some proof behind your
claims. That can come in an actual demo
like we saw or maybe even some social
proof. And then part number five is your
CTA. Where can people actually go to buy
your product? A dozen times over in
razor [music] refill savings. You can
replace the blades for literally cents,
whereas a cartridge is like $5 [music]
per refill. Order your Leaf Razor today.
>> And your CTA can really be that simple.
You just need to inform people of where
they can buy your product and maybe how
much it is. If you've got a really
compelling offer, you can throw that in
there as well. People are going to take
action if they don't know what action
they need to take. You can also spice up
this format with throwing in maybe some
benefits. For example, in this same leaf
shave example, we talk about how price
efficient a leaf razor actually is.
>> Smooth lifestyle, plastic free, and more
affordable. Seriously, [music] I know
it's more expensive, but this will pay
for itself a dozen times over in razor
[music] refill savings. You can replace
the blades for literally cents, whereas
a cartridge is like $5 [music] per
refill.
>> And the reason that we included that
inside this video was because we have a
lot of comments of people saying that
it's really expensive or it's not
affordable. And so we directly put a
section within this video to combat
that. So throughout the video, they go
on a bit of a journey. They have their
attention grabbed. They understand the
problem and the villain of the piece,
which is cartridge razors. They
understand the hero, which is the leaf
razor. And then they understand how it
works and why it's so great with the
product proof. And then we even throw in
an extra benefit to help them with that
doubt because they might not understand
why it costs so much. And then finally,
we throw in a CTA so that they know what
to do after they've watched the video.
It's the most simple format. I'd suggest
that you go ahead and you actually learn
how to write these scripts yourself, but
if you want, you could use something
like Gemini, for example. I don't have
any specific prompts. I'd love to give
it to you if I did. But usually, I just
say that you want to already be aware
going into the prompting stage that you
know who this villain is so you can tell
it that and then you want to present
your product as the hero. If you have
those two things, going into it and
building a script in something like
Gemini or Claude, whatever, is going to
be much easier. Now, I know that
throughout this video I've kind of shown
the same brand, but I really want to
show you another example of another
niche where this exact format works. So,
this is an ad that we made for
Underbrush, which are a chewing gum
brand.
>> Your gum contains the same plastic
compounds as partile. Polyvinyl acetate,
udyne styrene. You're literally chewing
rubber while it destroys your enamel.
Underbrush uses real tree sap and
rebuilds.
>> So, what do we do for the first like 10
seconds of that video? We talk about how
traditional gum is made out of all these
random chemicals and that you're
basically just chewing on rubber and
then we present underbrush as the better
alternative. We continue to educate
people on the product and why it's so
gray and the benefits of it. But it all
started by building up this villain
which is the traditional gum industry.
And then we want to plant underbrush as
the hero. You see how this format works.
Even in shorter videos like this one,
you can still build a narrative. You
might not be able to twist the knife
quite as much in the start of it, but
you'll definitely still be able to build
that narrative. Script writing is
probably one of the most valuable skills
that any creative strategist can have.
And it's not a skill that you can just
learn overnight. You need to do the reps
and you need to learn the skills over
and over again. The more scripts you
write, the better they will be.
Honestly, at this point, I've lost track
of how many that I've written and the
amount of scripts that I've taught
people how to write. And also, how many
people I've advised to not use AI and
learn the skill before you lean on AI to
write those scripts. The better that you
understand what goes into a great
script, the better you can guide an AI
into writing one for you. Like I
mentioned at the start of the video,
this is the exact format that we use at
Fraggle to make some killer creatives
right now in 2026. And if you want to go
deeper and learn my entire process of
how to make killer meta ad creatives,
I've got a video exactly for you. You
can watch that one next if you want. And
if you happen to be a DTOC brand that's
spending over 70,000 on ads, I would
