With the Andromeda update by Meta in
late 2025, I get a lot of messages from
advertisers saying, "Is using lookalike
audience still effective on Meta Ads in
2026?" The answer is absolutely yes. In
this video, I will show you the new way
to use lookalike audience on Meta Arts
in 2026. Lookalike audience is still a
gamecher for scaling your campaigns on
Meta Arts if you leverage it
effectively. Let's dive in. Here is my
example meta ads manager account. For
you to create an effective lookalike
audience in 2026, you need to focus on
valuebased audience sources. What do I
mean by value based audience sources?
Audience that are valuable to your
business that they make purchase from
your business or they sign up to your
business. So if you are creating look
alike of that it means you are feeding
the meta ecosystem or the meta system
with right information to look for the
look alike of those kind of customers
for you and when you in 2026 the more
information the more data you've
provided or you provided for the meta
system the more chances of you having
success or you driving more result on
the platform. In 2026, the meta system
is AIdriven. The AI the AI system is
also smart. The algorithm is very very
smart. So you need to provide the
algorithm more data about your business,
more data about your customers to help
you make smarter decisions for you. That
is all. So the more data you provide it
despite the fact that it is smart, the
more data you provide for it, the more
results it will get you. So what should
we do? How can we create lookalike
audience focusing on valuebased
audience? The first thing you need to do
is to come to all tools here. Then you
go to audiences. You can also see
audiences under advertise here. But from
your meta ads manager account, right?
You come to all tools. Then you select
audiences.
Lookalike audience is very very
important. It's still very very
important on meta and it is still
relevant to your business. You just need
to know how to use it and know how to
create effective lookalike audiences. So
you come to create an audience then you
select lookalike audience. Can you see
lookalike audience reach new people who
are similar to audiences that you are
you already care about.
What who are what are the kind of
audience that you already care about as
a business? Let's say you are an
e-commerce business. The kind of
audience you already care about are
people that have added product to cart
on your platform. They are people that
they've made purchase on your on your
website. They've already bought product
from you. You you care about those
people. So if you are creating lookalike
audience of all those kind of people, it
means you are telling the meta system.
The meta system is AIdriven in 2026. And
if you are telling the meta system to go
and look for the lookalike of all those
kind of audience, they will look for it
for you.
It will look for it for you. So you can
you see you can create a lookalike
audience based on people who who like
your page conversion pixel or any of
your existing custom audience. I will
tell you to focus on valuebased kind of
audiences. What are value based kind of
audience? If I click on this now I will
select it will ask you select your
audience source. If you come to this
select your audience source go to your
pixel where you have value based
audience. Your pixel is is collecting
data. Your pixel has data of people that
have bought product from your website.
They have data of people that have that
have added product to your website that
they have viewed product. Those are the
kind of thing you should focus on. They
are value based audiences. Can you see
value based sources? If I come to Meta
Pixel now, let's just say I select Meta
Pixel. This is just a dummy a dummy ad
account. I don't really really have a
lot of data on in here. And so that is
why you are seeing all these empty. But
just follow the process that I'm showing
you in this video to create your own
lookalike audience. So the select select
an event source you leave it as website
because you are using a website. Then
select an event with value. Choose
purchase. Can you see they they telling
you that you should choose purchase
recommended. So if you come to order
value now you can see other value. You
can see add payment info, add to cart,
add to wish list, complete registration,
initiate checkout and all those. You can
also use that. They are they are also
value based or audience sources but
let's use purchase for instance. So if
you select this now if you have data if
your pixel has data this is a dummy
account if your pixel has data you will
see you see highest value passed the
highest value of kind of customers that
your day your pixel has passed in the
last let's say 60 days. Can you see? We
look at frequency and recency of
selected events as well as the value
that it contains. Can you see lowest
value pass this is very very powerful
and unique customers that have made
those purchase. So that is why I said it
is datadriven. It is really really
datadriven. Just follow the step in this
video and make sure your own data is
sending your own pixel is sending enough
data. This is a dummy account. So that's
why you are not seeing a lot of data. So
once you see this you'll see we have
received all purchase you it will show
you the total number of purchase that
your pixel has recorded in the last 60
days that contains value from the pixel
in the last 60 days you will see it
there. So you also come to select an
audience location. If you come to select
an audience location now you type in
your location there. So let's say United
Kingdom. Let's say I want to do United
Kingdom for instance. Now I'll come to
this then my size select audience size
number of lookalike audience that you
want to create. So I create between 1 to
3%
depending on your budget depending on
how you want to leverage this but if you
are extending to 10 and all I feel it
will be too broad so 1.6 million is
still okay a 1.6 6 million audience
bucket that you want to target is quite
reasonable size of audience and you you
you can get you can you can play around
that data a lot and get customers look
alike reasonable lookalike audience to
come and buy from you and can you see a
1% lookalike audience consist of people
are most who are most similar to your
lookalike audience increasing dep create
a bigger and broader audience that is
why I don't stretch to to 8 to 9 to 10.
I leave it between 1% to 2% and to 3%.
So you can just leave this at 1% or
let's say 3% for for this video. So if
you come to this place now you just
select create audience then your
audience will be created. So it means
you have created. So I said focus on
valuebased
audiences. Focus on value based
audiences. Once you click on create
audience, you've been able to create
your audience. The not let's so let's
click on this create audience. If you
click on this create audience, it will
create our lookalike audience for us
right now. So audience can't be your
lookalike needs to include at least 100
people in the same country in your
audience in your audience location.
Please choose a different audience
location. So they want it to contain at
least 100 people
in the same location that I am. So can
you see now an audience can't be
created. Your look alike source needs to
include at least 100 people in the same
country in your audience location.
So it means my pixel hasn't been
collecting data. And you see that is why
I'm showing you that the unique number
of people it hasn't collected data of up
to 100 people but I you should focus on
all value based audience. Audience can
be created your lookalike audience
source need to include at least 100
people in the same country in your
audience location. Please choose a
different location or lookalike audience
source. your audience, your lookalike
audience source needs to include at 100
people in the same country in your
audience location. So, so what we will
do now is to come to this place. Let me
change this pixel to probably a an
active pixel. So, let me choose this
maybe this audience will create. So if I
click on create now
able to it's still telling me the same
thing but focus on value based audience
focus on value based audience
for your lookalike audience that you are
creating. So let's go to another one.
Let's go to other sources. You have
options to also create lookalike
audience based on other sources. But the
first one you need to prioritize is
valuebased audience source. So if you if
you come to this place and you see use
event with value to create better look
alikes. Find people who are similar to
your most valuable customers by using
value data from from event on your site.
When you select purchases for example we
we look at how often and how much they
spent. So the reason why this audience
are not creating here,
this audience that I've set here is
because I don't have enough data of over
100 people in in my location that
they've made purchase and the pixel
cannot record over 100 people that have
made purchase on my account. So I can't
really create lookalike audience on on
this. But focus on value based audience
is the most effective. So if you come to
if we explore other sources for instance
now other sources are custom audience
that you've created let's say custom
audience of people that they've
interacted with your page custom
audience of people that they've viewed
your page and all those things. So we
can do all custom audience of people
that have viewed your page in the last
180 days. You can also create lookalike
audiences of this. So, so between value
based sources and other sources, value
based sources is the is the most
effective when you are creating
lookalike audience because it tax your
pixel data. It has purchase data
directly from from from meta. But in
some cases, you can look you can use
other sources. Let's say you've created
custom audience of custom audience of
people using customer list and you have
those data. At this point you can also
or you have data of people their name
their phone number their email address
and whatever information you have about
them you can use other sources at that
point because they are also valuable. So
if I cancel this now I you if you have
custom audience using customer list that
you've created you can select this here
under other sources then you can use it.
So but let's say we select this then my
location will be United Kingdom. Once I
select I select an audience size number
of look alikes I can select 1% to 3%
recommended that I said earlier then
I'll come to create an audience again.
So this should create an audience. Can
you see the this was able to create that
audience for me. The reason why the
value based audience wasn't created is
because this ad account doesn't have
enough data enough data of up to 100
people that have made purchase that the
pixel has recorded. But my advice for
you is to is for you to focus on
valuebased sources. Especially if you
are an e-commerce business and you want
you want Facebook or the meta system to
look for the lookalike of those kind of
customers that you you your pixel has
recorded that they've made purchase from
you and you want to retarget them with
offers. You want to retarget them with
different offerings basically. So where
can you use other sources? In the case
whereby you you are running a lead
generation campaign and you want to
you create custom custom audience or
using customer list of people that have
submitted their name on your website,
their email address. You have them in
your database as a lead and you now want
to look for the look alike of all those
kind of leads. So you've created custom
audience of people based on their name.
They have named their last name and
their email address. Then you can use
other sources at that point. So but
value based sources is the most
effective because it has your meta
pixel, it has conversion data, purchase
data from you, they are the most
effective when you are using lookalike
audience. So how can you use lookalike
audience
in your meta ads? When you are setting
your meta. So let's go to all sources
because there's a new way to use it
right now. So let's go to all sources
and come to ads manager.
So when I come to ads manager, we we'll
create a new
a new campaign. So let's create a new
campaign right now. So let me give it a
minute to come up and we'll create a new
campaign. Let's assume that we are
creating a new campaign. So when you
create a new campaign, I will show you
where you need to apply your lookalike
audience that you have created. So let's
come to create a campaign. If you come
to create a campaign here, right, you go
to
sales campaign. So we'll give our
campaign a name and select sales
campaign. So our objective should be
sales.
So let's select sales.
Then you click on continue.
Once you click on continue,
it will take us to the campaign level
where you need to give your campaign a
name. So once you give your campaign a
name, give your campaign a name. The
buying type, leave it as auction. The
campaign objective, leave it as sales.
Then you go to
next.
Once you go to next,
what I just want to show you is
where you put in your audience. [music]
So you come to conversion location. Your
conversion location is website. Your
performance goal is number maximize
numbers of conversion. Then you come
down to where this is. So where your
audience is under audience you see
come to this place you see suggest an
audience you come to suggest an audience
then you select suggest an audience then
you see include this custom audience so
include this custom audience so this is
where you include custom audience but
that's not where you use it you come to
use saved audience
So
this is so let me look for where you see
it. So let's come to this page and
select this. Then I come to this place.
Then you select this.
So can you see this is where you will
put it. Can you see the lookalike
audience we've created? So this is how
you apply the audience you've created to
your campaign. So this is the look
alike. Can you see include this custom
audience? Can you see look alike? If you
come to lookalike audience now it will
show you the lookalike audience that
you've created but it is still
populating. So this is how you will just
apply it. You create a campaign under
adsets. You come to audiences then you
come to suggest an audience. Then you
select the lookalike audience that
you've just created and it will be
applied to your campaign. Then you can
set up your ads, upload the images, put
the text and description, put the call
to action and every other thing that you
need to do to remarket your offers and
let the meta system and meta look for
the lookalikes of your ideal customers
for you to make purchase from your
business. Leveraging lookalike audience
is still an effective tactic to scale
your campaigns on Meta in 2026. When you
use it strategically, Meta can be the
best advertising platform for your
business. If you found this video
