Today, I'm giving you the exact
threepart framework that I would follow
if I was running Facebook ads in 2026.
I'll be taking what I've learned in
driving over a billion dollars in
revenue over the last 11 years for
dozens of seven, eight, and even 9
figure brands, and I'll be condensing
everything down into a single plan that
you can copy and paste into your
business today. Whether you are just
starting out and running ads for the
very first time or if you're already an
advanced brand scaling rapidly in 2026.
While I have a lot prepared for us at
level one, the very first thing you need
to lock in is your mentality when you
are running Facebook ads in 2026. And I
say this with the utmost importance
because people have a false expectation
that they're going to turn on ads and
get a 20x return on ad spend. I'm here
to tell you that the biggest brands in
the world are just breaking even and
just getting over the hump of being
profitable because they actually care
about acquiring as many new customers as
possible to then make that army of
existing customers come back over and
over and over again. So on my screen is
a pretty complicated strategy, but what
you need to focus on when you're just
starting out is your prospecting CBO
campaign. This is the main campaign.
This is the driving force of your entire
account. And this is so important
because what it's going to do is be the
host for what you're going to build on
eventually. Every single account needs a
core prospecting CBO campaign. This
campaign is the testing and a big part
of the scaling of every single account
that we manage at the Moonlighters. So
the function of this campaign is to host
new creatives all the time and have them
compete in a hyperco competitive
environment within your own ad account.
And how this works is we create a single
prospecting campaign and then within
that campaign we upload broad packs.
These are ad sets. Every time you have a
new creative to upload or creative
concept to upload or just a pack of new
creatives, anywhere from literally two
creatives upwards of 10 to even 12
creatives in a single ad set that gets
grouped together in a new pack. What I
like to do is I like to date those
packs. So if this launched on the very
first day of the year, then this would
be a pack. If this launched 15 days
later, this be a new pack and so on.
Once we establish this prospecting CBO,
it's then time to define the remainder
of our structure. And the remainder of
the structure, which is what I call the
M3 structure, is very important. It
starts with that prospecting CBO. That's
where the testing goes on. That's where
the graduation system begins. And what
we want to essentially do in this
campaign right here is every time we
have winning ads from the prospecting
CBO, we then want to take those ads and
graduate them into the top campaign,
which I call the scaling campaign. This
campaign is nothing special. All it's
going to do is dedicate budget to a
specific set of ads that you absolutely
know works better than anything. And
then once we start to acquire customers,
gain some momentum, what we eventually
want to do is roll out our retargeting
and our retention strategies. Each of
these has their own purposes, but the
core purpose is that making sure that at
no part of the funnel are we missing
anyone. We want to make sure we're
always showing ads to the most relevant
consumers all of the time. We also want
to have a retentionbased campaign
because as I said right at the beginning
here, the point of advertising is to
acquire as many customers as possible
and then get them to buy over and over
and over again. This here, this is where
you're going to make your most amount of
money. This is your cash cow for your
business. Now, this structure can get
complicated quick. It's going to get
bigger and bigger over time. The
important thing we all need to
understand about this structure is the
swim lane philosophy. A lot of people
get confused on this. A lot of people
think this is top of funnel,
middleunnel, bottom funnel. It is not.
This is new audiences, engaged
audiences, existing customers. Top,
middle, bottom, which is traditional
marketing really focuses on the fact
that you need to nurture a customer all
the way to the purchase. New engage
existing or what I call swim lanes. This
is very much just focus on knowing where
you're spending your money. For example,
if you go into your audience breakdowns,
which I have a picture of right here,
you go to your breakdowns and your
audience, you will actually see where
you're spending your money based on
existing, new, and engaged audiences in
the Facebook ads platform. The reason
that we're so bullish on this swim lane
setup is because I believe as an
advertiser, you need to know where
you're spending your money. Let's say we
had a $10,000 budget. Traditional
Facebook is going to take this $10,000
and if you don't have proper swim lanes
and exclusions, it's just going to spend
it wherever it wants to. In fact, it's
probably going to overspend on your
existing customers and your engaged
customers because these audiences are
going to have the highest ROI for the
business. Existing customers already
purchased from you. These are people
that are going to have three plus return
on ad spend, even greater. Engaged
audiences are going to be similar to
existing, but not as qualified. They're
probably really close to the bottom of
the funnel, close to purchasing. They've
done things like added to cart, visited
your website. They're going to have a
higher return on ad spend. These are
made up numbers than your new. Your new
audience is going to have the lowest
return on ad spend, which means Facebook
is going to distribute the budget to
engage and existing first to deplete
that bottom of the funnel. And what
often happens with advertisers without
exclusions, you spend way too much money
on engaged and way too much money on
existing. We need to make sure the
distribution of spend is mostly focused
on our new audiences. Our new audiences
are going to feed our engaged audiences
and eventually they're going to make
existing customers. These two engage and
existing do not work without feeding new
audiences first. So always making sure
and that's why we have swim lanes that
we're spending the majority of our cash
in new customers and only spending
appropriate amounts in engaged and
existing. And I like sharing this
screenshot here because it's just the
most important breakdown that you need
to look at all of the time. You should
be constantly looking at your audience
segments, your new engage and existing
audiences in your ad account. This is
the only way you're ever going to know
if you're actually spending the right
amount of money on each part and each
campaign. Okay, level two, you have a
structure at this point. This is where
you need to establish your creative
flywheel. If you do not have a proper
creative flywheel, nothing else is going
to matter. You need to have a non-stop
flow of creatives. And that's just not
junk creatives going into your account.
That is a proper system based on what's
actually winning in your ad account and
other ad accounts. So, you need to
source that knowledge collectively to
find and create more good creatives. It
starts at the very top where of course
we launch our creative. We then wait
around 7 to 14 days before we touch
anything. After that, we want to analyze
those new creatives. And we're always
analyzing that creative using
incremental attribution. Incremental
attribution is one of the most important
things that you need to use when you're
analyzing your creative because just
like I said before, you need to make
sure your creative is geared towards new
customer acquisition to feed your entire
business. After you analyze that
creative, it's then time to brief. You
want to brief the winning best ads in
your ad account based on that
incremental attribution. And then from a
third party, this could be the Facebook
ads library. This could be Magic Brief.
This could be Motion. However you look
at it, you're sourcing your competitor
concepts. So you want to be looking at
what all your competitors are doing.
Look at the concept you think you can
create, things that look good, things
that they've been running the longest,
and then go ahead and brief and create
new concepts. This creation of new
concepts is nonstop. This is happening
every week, every two weeks. You always
want to have non-stop new creatives
coming into your ad account. Now,
because you're launching non-stop new
ads, new creatives all the time, you
obviously want to make sure that you
have a system in place. And just like I
broke down on the first level one, when
you have that structure, you're going to
note that your adsets are going to start
to stack up. This is just an example on
my screen of an actual ad account that
we manage right now. And you can see
every single week, we basically have new
creatives flowing into the ad account.
And it gets messy. It gets pretty big.
We have a lot of packs, different dates
of these packs all the time flowing in.
This is acceptable. This is okay. What
this is creating for us is a very
competitive environment. And what this
actually does for the budget is the best
thing possible. Let's say again we had
that $10,000 budget. If you were running
something like testing or you had
different campaigns, then what that 10K
is going to do is be distributed
wherever you as the human operator
decides to distribute it. What's going
to be done in a CBO environment that's
hyperco competitive is extremely
extremely different. In this case,
what's going to happen is the budget is
going to be spent wherever it's driving
the most performance. What naturally
might happen is, let's say this adset
right here, this adset right here, and
this adset here are the top three
performing adsets. They're going to get
90 plus% of the budget. And then
everything else on the bottom is going
to get bare minimums. That's actually
what we want to happen because Facebook
has the capability to actually determine
what's going to do better with very few
signals. Way quicker than you and I can.
way quicker than any human being can
just looking at engagement and signals
that we don't even have visibility to.
Like how long it took someone to scroll
past your ad or did someone like your
ad? Did someone swipe once on a carousel
but never clicked? Those are things and
metrics that we don't have actual access
to that Facebook knows based on that
individual human's behavior if they're
likely to purchase or not. And level two
caps off with an extreme emphasis on
advanced breakdowns. Now, what advanced
breakdowns are are starting to look at
very complex data in the ad account like
day of week, time of day, ages, gender,
you name it. Any advanced breakdown that
applies to your account, you want to
take a close look at old school
Facebook, traditional Facebook, if you
were in this game 10, 15 years ago, you
would know that you never ever spent the
same amount of money every single day of
the week. And then something suddenly
happened a few years ago. iOS 14.5 drops
and all of a sudden everyone is spending
the same budget every single day. We
spend $100 a day, $1,000 a day, $100,000
a day, whatever. Every day the same.
Check out this example that I have on my
screen right here. This is over the
course of a 30-day period where this
brand spent a total of $55,000. Now,
when we look at this, we see pretty
close levels of spend per day. A little
bit more on Sundays and Mondays, a
little bit less as the week goes on. But
the most important thing to recognize
here is that their return on ad spends
Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday are
significantly worse than Wednesday
through Saturday. So why on earth aren't
we spending more on the better
performing days of the week? So go into
your Shopify, go into your Facebook and
cross-co compare your return on ad
spends and your conversion rates by day
of the week and spend the most amount of
money when people are most likely
converting on your business. And that
same exact philosophy applies to age. It
applies to gender. And go down every
single breakdown because this is how you
squeeze Facebook to make the most amount
of money. Don't worry if you have to
drop your budgets by 50% on certain days
of the week. If this is what the data
says, do it. In this case, I'd probably
drop my budgets on Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, 20%. I'd probably up my budgets
Wednesday through Saturday another 15 to
20%. And now, time for level three.
Level three is the most advanced part of
Facebook ads and it's going to sound
actually the most simple. In level
three, we are introducing cost caps.
Now, I want to really explain the most
important part of a cost cap. There is
two sides to the coin when it comes to
bidding in meta ads. First, Meta will
aim to spend your entire budget and get
the most purchases using the highest
volume bidding strategy. This is
standard. This is what most people are
going to use. If keeping the average
cost per result around a certain amount
is important, enter a cost per result
goal. This is better known as a cost cap
or a target return on ad spend. There's
multiple strategies involved, but a cost
control where you're limiting the cost
factor is what we're talking about here.
Now, here's what we all need to
understand about cost caps. In a normal
highest volume setup, level one and
level two. Every single day, roughly,
you're spending around the same amount
of money. What that means is because
you're spending the same amount of
money, what actually is changing is your
cost per acquisition. So let's say your
cost per acquisition target, this is
your target right here, and it's
something like $100. So what happens is
some days you go a little bit under the
target. Those are good days. Someday you
go over the target, those are bad days.
And under, over, under, over. Some days
stay the same. This is a rough idea of
what it looks like. You have normal
fluctuations all equaling out to what
you want your target CPA to look like.
Now, in this setup, which is standard,
spend is flat and the goal or the target
is variable. In a cost cap environment,
this inverses this blue line here now is
actually your CPA, which we're just
going to say is $100. Again, you're
setting a set CPA that you're willing to
achieve. And then your spend is what's
variable. So when you have multiple
strong days and Facebook actually sees
that it can scale, it's going to spend
above your average threshold. Then when
it's doing worse, it's going to spend
less and better on better performing
days. This allows your cost per
acquisition to stay more flat, but
ultimately spend less or more depending
on if the availability and scale is
there for you. There's a major flaw in
this. If you don't have enough signal in
your account, this will never work
perfectly for you. And furthermore,
Facebook will just simply not have
enough data to actually know if it's
doing the right thing or wrong, leading
to things like overspending or in many
cases not spending at all. Now, when
you're running cost caps, this opens up
multiple strategies that you could
leverage in your account, leveraging
more leveraging different creative
tests, being very restrictive, trying
bid caps, target rorowaz, and cost caps,
all are all possibilities when you
actually get to that safety net of cost
caps being available. But if you're
watching this and you're not even close
to that level of spend, then I have a
little bit of an alternative where you
could test and kind of play in a very
important part of level three. This is
what's called an adset spending limit.
The point of the adset spending limit is
it allows you to test new creatives
consistently while giving them minimum
or maximum spends and not having that
interfere with the CBO system that we've
created. So, you don't need to use
You don't need to be everything manual,
but you also have the capability to
guarantee spend against new creatives
that you spent a lot of time creating.
The way that this basically functions is
on a normal account when you launch a
new creative it starts right here from
big fat zero and over time it starts to
spend a little bit more money and if
it's a winner then great it scales up
but there's this long period of time
that it needs to learn it needs to
figure out what's going on. What we want
to basically be able to do is shortline
that. And how we do that is we started
on a minimum budget. Now I like to do 1x
the CPA. So, if your cost per
acquisition is $50, set this for $50 to
start. And what it's going to do usually
is those first few days, it's learning
and it's going to pick up some
conversions. And as long as it's picking
up conversions better than the other ads
in the account, then it's going to
shortline the scale because it doesn't
need to wait all of this time down here
to figure out if it's going to be
successful and better than the other
ads. Therefore, it could pick up much
quicker. Now, it might not necessarily
scale as high as I just gave in that
example. It might do something similar
to this, but it's just going to shorten
the length of how long it actually takes
to scale the ads. This is a very
important part of level three because it
allows you to test more creatives at
volume. Big pro tip here, don't run
these too long. 7 days max. If after
that 7-day period, the minimum that you
set is still being followed, meaning you
set it to 50 and it's spending 50,
shutting that down is going to really
reduce the spend, probably to the bare
minimum. On the flip side, if it's
already spending over the 50, let's say
that is 50 and it's spending something
like 200 bucks a day, it's just going to
continue. Shutting this off is going to
do absolutely nothing. So, it's the
easiest setting to safely shut off. And
you're not going to shut off the ads.
You're just shutting off how much
they're being forced to spend. Now,
while I just went through a lot, it's
probably really important, especially if
you're in level one, to understand how
we're implementing exactly true copy and
paste of the structure that I just
detailed. And if you want to see that
entire video where I go through
everything a toz, click the link right

campaign structure step by step in the
ads manager so you could bring it into
yours. That's all for today. Okay, hope
you got a ton of value out of this video
and let's have a good
