Claudebot, aka OpenClaw, is the most
powerful AI tool ever released, but only
if you use it the right way. In this
video, I'm going to cover five simple
things you can do right now to make
Claudebot 100 times more powerful than
it already is. I'm going to show you how
to improve its memory, its intelligence,
and even show you how to get it to do
things proactively while you sleep. Now,
let's lock in and get into it. This
first tip is a super easy one and one
you can implement in literally 5
seconds. Claudebot's memory is
incredible, but it's not as incredible
as it could be. There's actually two
memory settings that are off by default
that make it so much better. One is
memory flush, the other is session
memory search. While you're using
Clawbot and talking to it, it
automatically does memory compactions.
What it basically does is clean up the
memory so you don't use a ton of tokens.
The issue is that after every memory
compaction, it just forgets a ton of
things. So you can be having a
conversation and then it will forget
what it said 5 seconds ago right after a
compaction. This prompt I put down below
implements two features that fix that.
Memory flush. What that does right
before the compaction, it records the
most important parts of your
conversation so it remembers it right
after the compaction. The other is
session memory search. And what that's
going to do is basically allow your
Claudebot to search through your entire
conversation history when you say
something it doesn't remember. These two
features combined when enabled with this
prompt I put down in the description
below will make your Clawbot memory a
thousand times better. So take the
prompt from down below, put it into your
Claudebot, and you just improved your
Clawbot 100x. The next major tip I have
to give to you is find the right model
for each task you have your Claudebot to
do. So what most people are doing is
they're using Opus 45, which don't get
me wrong is the best AI model out there,
but they're using it for every single
task they do. And this leads to your
Claudebot slowing down as well as
costing you tons of money. There are
better ways to do this. This is how I
look at Claudebot as a brain and
muscles. Opus is the best brain ever.
This is the model you're communicating
with when you talk to Claudebot. But you
want to choose the best muscles. And
Opus isn't the best for every single
muscle. Muscles being like coding, web
search, social search. So you want to
implement models that are better at each
one of these. Codeex is a great coding
model. I find Opus controls it really
well. Gemini is great for web search.
Grock is great for social search. So
what you want to do is go to your
cloudbot and say, "Hey, moving forward,
I want to use codec cli for all coding.
I want to use the Gemini API for all web
search. I want to use the Grock API for
all social search." And what your
Claudebot will do is walk you through
that setup. It'll ask you for your API
keys. You give the keys and it will set
up all these muscles for you. Then it
will remember next time you ask, "Hey,
can you build me this? Can you search
for this? Can you find this on X?" It
will use the right muscles for the right
task which will save you tons of money
and get you way better results. You want
to think of Clawbot as brain and
muscles. And whenever you have a do
certain tasks, you want to figure out
what is the best muscle for those tasks.
And if you don't know what the best
muscle for those tasks are, good news,
you can just ask your Clawbot what the
best muscle is and it will figure it out
for you. After you've implemented the
improvement I talked about a second ago,
go in implement these better muscles
with your Clawbot and you'll save tons
of money. The third tip for improving
your Clawadbot is a really critical one
that everyone needs to do. I had this
super viral post yesterday that has
almost 9 million views about how my
Clawudebot called me one morning
randomly. It implemented its own voice.
It implemented its own phone number and
it called me when I woke up. This is
100% real. This actually happened. But
it happened because I did this next tip
I'm about to give you, which is one,
tell Claudebot all about myself. so has
complete context around what I need to
accomplish with my workflow and two set
expectations for our working
relationship. Now what do those two
things mean? So brain dumping which is
telling your claudebot all about
yourself is super critical cuz its
memory is so good. So everything you
tell it it will remember. So, if you
tell it all about your dreams,
ambitions, goals, what you do on a daily
basis, your personal relationships,
everything you're interested in, your
hobbies, why you think the Patriots are
going to win the Super Bowl? If you tell
it all those things, it will remember
that context so that the tasks it does
are much more helpful. But how do I get
it to do these proactive things where it
called me out of the blue when I woke
up? Well, that came from expectation
setting. What is expectation setting?
That's setting the expectation with your
Claudebot around what you want your
working relationship to be. The issue is
most people talk to their Claudebot like
it's a chatbot. It isn't, right? They
they treat it like a search engine where
they just ask a questions and it gets
answers. That's not how you want to
treat it. You want to treat it like your
employee. And if you ever had employees
before, the first thing you do when they
start at their job is you do expectation
setting around the type of work you want
from them. And you want to do that with
your Cloudbot. So what I did with my
Claudebot is I told it, I want you to be
proactive. I want you to work every
night when I go to sleep and I want to
be able to wake up every morning and be
surprised by what you built yourself.
And because I did that, every morning I
wake up now, I wake up to a surprise.
Whether it's Claudebot implementing its
own phone number, its own voice, its own
face, whatever, every night it builds
something that gets us closer to our
goals. And it also surprises me if you
do those two things, brain dump and set
expectations, you'll get significantly
better results out of your Clawbot. So
take, it should only take like 10
minutes. Take 10 minutes, tell it all
about yourself. And then explicitly tell
it that you want it to do work for you
overnight while you sleep so you wake up
and it builds something that gets you
closer to your goals. You do those two
things, you're going to get so much
better result out of your CL. It's just
about changing your mindset, treating
your Clawbot like an employee, not like
a search engine like 99% of other people
do. By the way, if you learned anything
so far, make sure to leave a like down
below. Make sure to subscribe and turn
on notifications. I'm pumping out tons
of content about what I believe is the
most important AI tool ever made,
Claudebot. You'll get way more of it and
learn about all the latest releases the
moment they come out if you turn on
notifications down below. And also, I
just did a full hour and a half boot
camp about Claudebot in the Vibe Coding
Academy. Recording is posted. So, to get
instant access to that boot camp, just
hit the link down below for the Vibe
Coding Academy and you'll be able to see
the entire thing. The next tip, and this
is a huge one that will improve your
prompting with Claudebot so much, is
reverse prompting. What is reverse
prompting? What 99% of people do is they
do regular prompting, right? They tell
their Clawbot what to do. Do this, do
that. The issue is the Claudebot is so
much smarter than us. So us coming up
with all our own prompts is actually
kind of stupid to do. You want to
reverse prompt. You want to say, "Hey,
Claudebot, ask me what you need from me
to do better work based on what you know
about me. What should you be doing?"
We're basically prompting Claude to make
its own prompt. That's called reverse
prompting, and it is a critical skill
for Claudebot. So, to give you some
examples, based on what you know about
me and my goals, what are some tasks you
can do to get us closer to our missions?
So, instead of me telling Claudebot what
to do, I'm saying, "Hey, based on what
you know about me, what should you be
doing right now?" That's a reverse
prompt. Claudebot's going to be a lot
better at coming up with tasks to do
than you are. Another example of a
reverse prompt, what other information
can I provide you to improve our
productivity? Right? I'm not telling you
what to do. I'm saying, "Hey, you tell
me what to do. What do you need from me?
What can I do to help you out? And since
this is basically super intelligence,
it's going to figure out better tasks to
do than we could have told it to do.
These reverse prompts will help you get
so much better productivity out of your
Clawbot. I put both of these prompts
down below. But basically, the mindset
you want to have now is instead of
explicitly telling your Clawbot what to
do, ask it a bunch of questions. See
what it's capable of. Have it dictate
itself what it should be doing. I bet
you you get way better results out of
it. And I'm just curious before I go
into this very last tip, which I think
is going to be massive. Which one of
these tips have been the most helpful so
far? And would you like any follow-up
videos doing a deeper dive on any of
them or any other questions you have on
Claudebot? Let me know down below. I
will make as many videos as you need
here. I want to make sure I make the
most helpful videos possible. Let's get
into this last tip, and that is have
your Claudebot build its own tooling
out. The best part about Claudebot is
it's fully extensible. It is fully
customizable. You can add your own
tooling on, but many people don't ask
claw to build those out for you. So, you
want to ask your clawbot, hey, what
other tooling can we build to improve
our productivity? Check what it built
out for me here. This is a full task
board that it built out where I can
track all the tasks it's doing, what's
in the backlog, what it's working on,
what it reviewed, and then I can see the
entire history of activity of what it
accomplished for me. This all came from
me prompting the Cloudbot. Hey, what
tooling can we build to be more
productive? They said, 'Oh, I can build
a cananban board so you can track all my
tasks. And I said, 'Go right ahead, do
that. Here's another one. I asked, "What
tools can we build to help me look back
at our past conversations?" And he's
like, "Oh, I'll build you a document
viewer, and then I'll put all our
memories and tasks into documents for
you." Boom. Here is our document viewer
that it just built out in this mission
control. Your Claudebot is an incredible
vibe coder. You need to take advantage
of its vibe coding abilities. Go to
after you install Codeex as its coding
muscle. Say, "Hey, I'd like to build out
some tooling based on our working
relationship. What are some tools you
could build out so we can be more
productive together?" I guarantee you it
comes up with some amazing things. And
if you just need an idea to start off
with, say, "Hey, build a task board so I
can track all your tasks out." That'll
get you started. Then from there, you
can start layering on other tools like
you see here. where I have like a
project board, a memory board, captures,
people, an entire CRM. These are all
things you can have it build out for
you. I will be creating so many more
videos on Clawbot. I truly believe this
is a huge lifechanging moment for a lot
of people in AI and tech. This is going
to change the way a lot of people work.
