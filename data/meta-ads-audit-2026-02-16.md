## 🎯 AD-LEVEL ANALYSIS (Current Campaign)

| Ad Name | Spend | Clicks | CTR | CPC | LPV | ATC |
|---------|-------|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **AD13 - Nothing Style B** | $65 | 1,405 | 34.5% | $0.05 | 872 | 0 |

| AD11 - Burnout | $1 | 1 | 3.8% | $0.54 | 0 | 0 |

### 🚨 THE PROBLEM IS CLEAR

**"Nothing Style" ads (AD12 & AD13) are eating 20% of budget but producing ZERO quiz starts.**

These ads have:
- 2,139 clicks combined (94% of all clicks!)
- 1,280 landing page views
- **0 AddToCart events**

This means people are clicking, landing on the page, but NOT checking the box and clicking "Book My Call."

**The ONLY ad that produced an AddToCart was "11A - Case Study Timeline"** — the Ohio case study ad.

## 🔴 ROOT CAUSE DIAGNOSIS

### Problem 1: "Nothing Style" Ads Are Click Traps
AD12 and AD13 have astronomical CTRs because they're designed as engagement bait, not qualified lead magnets. They attract:
- Curiosity clickers
- People who won't convert
- Non-attorneys browsing

**Fix:** Pause AD12 and AD13 immediately. They're burning budget.

### Problem 2: Current Funnel Too Simple?
You simplified cases.kuriosbrand.com to just checkbox → calendar. But the only AddToCart came from the full quiz flow on kuriosbrand.com.

The checkbox alone might not create enough commitment/qualification.

### Problem 3: Optimizing for Wrong Event
Current campaign optimizes for OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS but only has 1 conversion event. Meta can't learn with 1 event in 4 days.

### Problem 4: Budget Concentration
"11A - Case Study Timeline" has the ONLY conversion but only 16% of budget. The "Nothing Style" ads are stealing budget despite zero conversions.

## 📊 BENCHMARKS vs INDUSTRY

| Metric | Your Current | Your Best | Industry Avg (Legal) |
|--------|--------------|-----------|---------------------|
| CTR | 17.5% (inflated) | 7.5% | 1-2% |
| CPC | $0.33 (misleading) | $2.37 | $5-15 |
| CPM | $58 | $70 | $80-150 |
| Cost/Lead | $746 (1 ATC) | $36.61 | $50-150 |

Your BEST campaign ("Lead Focus") was actually hitting industry benchmarks. The current campaign has inflated metrics due to engagement-bait ads.

---

## 💰 PATH TO SUB-$100 CALLS

**Current Reality:**
- 1 closed deal @ ~$10k spend (but from older campaigns)
- Current campaign: $746 spent, 1 quiz start = $746/ATC

**To Hit $100/Call:**
1. Need ~50 quiz starts to get ~10 calls (20% show rate)
2. $100/call × 10 calls = $1,000 spend for 50 quiz starts
3. That's $20/quiz start target

**Your best campaign hit $36.61/quiz start.** You CAN get to $20-30 with:
- Better ad selection (kill the "Nothing" ads)
- Full quiz funnel (pre-qualifies better)
- Case study creative angle (proven converter)

---

1. ⏸️ **PAUSE AD12 & AD13 NOW** — click traps, zero conversions
2. 💰 **Give 70%+ budget to "11A - Case Study Timeline"** — your only converter
3. 🔄 **Change optimization to LPV** until you get 50+ ATCs
4. 📞 **Call your open pipeline** — $45k+ sitting there
