## KEY PATTERNS ACROSS ALL ADS

### What's Working:
1. **Video dominates** — Almost all top performers use video
2. **Performance guarantees** — "X results or don't pay"
3. **Territory exclusivity** — "Only one firm per area"
4. **Specific case studies** — "$40M revenue", "40+ attorney firm", "$250k/year"
5. **Anti-agency positioning** — "Tired of shiny gimmicks"
6. **AI angle** — But done tastefully, not hype

### Headlines That Convert:
- "AI + Google + ChatGPT = More Leads"
- "150 new cases... or you don't pay"
- "Get the playbook we used to scale our law firm"
- "Get Cases Without Ads"
- "Stop losing premium clients to competing firms"

### Copy Frameworks:
1. **Testimonial opener** → Case studies → CTA
2. **Pain agitation** → Anti-pattern → Solution
3. **Bold guarantee** → What's included → Scarcity
4. **Educational content** → Build trust → Soft CTA

### What's NOT being done:
- AI Visibility audits / GEO optimization
- One-time website offers (everyone sells retainers)
- Transparent pricing in ads
- Ownership guarantee (anti-Scorpion)
- Build First Pay Later model

## OPPORTUNITIES FOR KURIOS

Based on gaps in competitor ads:

1. **AI Visibility Audit lead magnet** — Nobody doing this
2. **One-time $12,500 pricing in ad** — Everyone hides pricing
3. **"You own it" angle** — Nobody explicitly guarantees ownership
4. **14-day delivery** — Nobody promises speed
5. **Build First Pay Later** — Nobody offering risk reversal at this level
6. **GEO/AI search optimization** — Only iLawyer mentions AI, nobody talks about ChatGPT citations
