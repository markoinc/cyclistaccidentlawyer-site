## 🔑 Quick Reference: What's Proven vs Experimental

### ✅ PROVEN STANDARDS (Battle-Tested)
These strategies have been validated over years across many accounts:

| Strategy | Why It's Proven |
|----------|-----------------|
| CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) | Meta default since 2019, widely adopted |
| Lookalike Audiences (1-3%) | Core targeting method for years |
| PAS/AIDA Copy Formulas | Copywriting fundamentals, decades old |
| 7-day click, 1-day view attribution | Industry standard attribution window |
| 50 conversions for learning phase | Meta's official guidance |
| Conversions API setup | Required since iOS 14.5 (2021) |
| Retargeting video viewers | Standard funnel tactic |
| Creative fatigue monitoring | Universal ad principle |
| 3-2-2 Testing Structure | Proven testing framework from Charley T |
| UGC outperforming polished ads | Consistent since 2020+ |

### 🧪 EXPERIMENTAL/NEWER (2024-2026)
These are newer strategies that show promise but need more validation:

| Strategy | Why It's Experimental |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Sales objective for Lead Gen** | Counter-intuitive, newer optimization hack |
| **Advantage+ Shopping (ASC)** | Released 2022, still evolving |
| **Advantage+ Audience** | AI-powered, less control, results vary |
| **Broad targeting (zero interests)** | Works with mature pixels, risky for new accounts |
| **Andromeda algorithm trust** | Post-2024 changes, still being understood |
| **20-50 creatives/week** | High-volume approach, resource intensive |
| **Flexible Ads feature** | Newer automation feature |

### ⚡ HIGH-RISK/ADVANCED (Proceed with Caution)
| Strategy | Risk Factor |
|----------|-------------|
| Horizontal scaling (duplicate campaigns) | Can cause auction overlap |
| 5-10% lookalikes | Very broad, lower quality |
| Killing CBO for manual bidding | Against Meta's direction |

## Detailed Annotations by Section

### Campaign Setup

**"Use Sales objective for lead generation"**
- 🧪 **EXPERIMENTAL** - This is a newer optimization trick
- **Why it works:** Meta's algorithm optimizes differently for Sales vs Leads
- **Risk:** May get fewer form fills but higher quality
- **Recommendation:** Test against Leads objective, compare quality

**"Enable CBO by default"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - Industry standard since 2019
- Meta actively pushes this; most experts recommend it

**"Use Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns (ASC)"**
- 🧪 **EXPERIMENTAL** - Released 2022, still maturing
- Works great for e-commerce with lots of products
- **Risk:** Less control, needs lots of creative assets
- **Recommendation:** Test with 70/30 budget split vs manual campaigns

**"Start with broad targeting (no interest targeting)"**
- 🧪 **EXPERIMENTAL** - Only works with mature pixel data
- ⚠️ **Risky for new accounts** - Need conversion history first
- **Recommendation:** Start with interests/lookalikes, go broad once you have 500+ conversions

**"3-2-2 Structure"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - Charley T's framework, widely validated
- Safe starting point for testing

### Budget & Scaling

**"20% Rule for Scaling"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - Long-standing best practice
- Prevents algorithm shock

**"Horizontal Scaling (Duplicate Campaigns)"**
- ⚡ **ADVANCED** - Can work but risky
- **Risk:** Auction overlap, competing with yourself
- **Recommendation:** Use sparingly, monitor for cannibalization

**"Budget 10x your target CPA"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - Helps exit learning phase faster
- Meta's own guidance supports this

**"TOF 60-70%, MOF 20-25%, BOF 10-15%"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - Traditional funnel allocation
- Good starting point, adjust based on your funnel

### Audience Targeting

**"Go broad and let the algorithm find buyers"**
- 🧪 **EXPERIMENTAL (Post-Andromeda)**
- Only after you have significant pixel data
- New accounts should NOT do this

**"Advantage+ Audience"**
- 🧪 **EXPERIMENTAL** - AI-powered, less predictable
- Results vary widely; test against manual targeting

**"Lookalikes 1-3%"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - Sweet spot for most advertisers
- Been reliable for years

**"First-party data is king"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - More true than ever post-iOS 14
- Upload customer lists, use email data

### Creative

**"40% UGC, 30% Testimonials, 20% Product, 10% Brand"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - UGC dominance is well-established
- Adjust ratios based on your brand

**"20-50 new creatives per week"**
- 🧪 **EXPERIMENTAL/AGGRESSIVE**
- Only for high-spend accounts ($10K+/day)
- Most accounts: 5-10/week is realistic

**"Hook Rate 30%+, Hold Rate 15%+"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - Good benchmarks to aim for

**"Flexible Ads feature"**
- 🧪 **EXPERIMENTAL** - Newer Meta feature
- Let's algorithm mix your assets; less control

### Attribution & Tracking

**"7-day click, 1-day view"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - Industry standard
- Compare with 7-day click only for cleaner data

**"Conversions API required"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - Non-negotiable since iOS 14.5
- Event Match Quality should be 6.0+

**"50 conversions for learning phase"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - Meta's official guidance
- Wait for this before making changes

### Conversion Events

**"Move up funnel if <25 purchases/week"**
- ✅ **PROVEN** - Standard optimization ladder
- Purchase → Add to Cart → View Content → Lead
