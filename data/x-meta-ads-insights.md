## Creative Strategy

### Creative is the Biggest Lever
> "The #1 best thing about mastering Facebook ads is realizing how much of it is just psychology. Once you learn to sell through words, headlines, and hooks, you can print money anywhere."
> — **@nicktheriot_**

**Key Takeaway:** Facebook ads mastery = psychology mastery. Learn to sell through words, headlines, and hooks.

---

> "If you're still guessing what creatives to run in your Facebook ads, you're leaving money on the table. The fastest way to scale an ecom brand to $1M/month isn't random testing, it's building a repeatable, research-driven creative system."
> — **@nicktheriot_**

**Key Takeaway:** Build a repeatable, research-driven creative system instead of random testing.

---

> "Your content isn't diverse enough and it's hampering your ability to reach the scale you desire. Too many brands are stuck iterating on the same concepts over and over."
> — **@herrmanndigital**

**Key Takeaway:** Your ad library should look more like the TikTok/Reels For You page—diverse, varied, fresh.

---

> "If there's one thing I'd recommend to creative strategists right now, it'd be to become a relentless hoarder of top performing ads. The value of a creative strat in the next 12-24 mo is going to come from knowing what to create, not the skill of creating ads itself."
> — **@alexgoughcooper**

**Key Takeaway:** Build a swipe file. Knowing WHAT to create matters more than HOW to create it.

---

### Creative Diversity vs. Volume
> "Creative diversity beats volume, but you need volume to get diversity. It's not about just pumping out more ads. You're looking for new 'entity IDs'. When your creatives are too similar, they fight each other."
> — **@max_rosewater**

**Key Takeaway:** Don't just create more ads—create DIFFERENT ads. Meta's Andromeda update groups similar creatives together.

---

> "One of the biggest mistakes I see in Meta Ad Accounts is not diversifying their creatives enough."
> — **@ashvinmelwani**

**Key Takeaway:** Diversify your creative mix across formats, angles, messaging, and visual styles.

---

### Research-Driven Creative
> "How to create Facebook ads that scale in 2025:
> 1. Lead with research—the better you know your customer, the better the ads you'll create
> 2. Focus on storytelling through creatives (feels less like an ad)"
> — **@nicktheriot_**

**Key Takeaway:** Start with customer research. Storytelling > hard selling.

---

## Ad Formats & Styles

### Top 8 Ad Styles (Fraser Cottrell)
> "What ads should you be running? Let me tell you. My top 8 ad styles:
> 1. **Us vs Them** - No-brainer for brands with direct competitors
> 2. **Big Headline** - Got a big bold claim? Base your entire advert around it
> 3. **The Review** - Pair reviews with an image
> 4. **Handwritten** - Not just sticky notes—simple handwritten notes feel personal
> 5. **Callout** - A staple of static ads"
> — **@sourfraser**

**Key Takeaway:** Test these proven formats: Us vs Them, Big Headline, Review-based, Handwritten, Callout.

---

### Product Grid Ads
> "In December we tested over 100 pieces of creatives on Facebook Ads. Here are 4 creative concepts that performed the best: Product Grid — These format ads have great CTRs as they draw attention & act as pattern interrupts. You're able to show the product in use."
> — **@Badalpandey_**

**Key Takeaway:** Product grids work as pattern interrupts and showcase multiple products/use cases.

---

### Framework-Based Creative
> "Facebook Ads 101: Never start from scratch, Use different frameworks for creating ads:
> - Pain, agitate, solve
> - Hook, educate, sell  
> - Attention, interest, desire, action"
> — **@Badalpandey_**

**Key Takeaway:** Use proven copywriting frameworks. Never start from a blank canvas.

---

### Podcast-Style Ads
> "To scale, you need podcast ads. Production setup guides (camera angles, mics, lighting). We've used this to shoot and launch 1000+ ads that scaled to over $100k/month in spend. The reason behind why podcast-style ads are better than UGC."
> — **@lorenzo_pravata**

**Key Takeaway:** Podcast-style ads can outperform traditional UGC at scale.

---

## Testing Framework

### The 3:2:2 Method
> "How to Do Facebook Ads Creative Testing with Ease and Confidence: the 3:2:2 Method. Instead of the traditional A/B testing, which often relies on luck and low-confidence data, the 3:2:2 method is about letting Facebook's algorithm do the heavy lifting."
> — **@CTtheDisrupter**

**Key Takeaway:** The 3:2:2 method leverages Meta's algorithm for more reliable creative testing.

---

### ABO vs CBO Testing
> "Why I test my Meta ads in ABO:
> - I want control over which ads get spend
> - I don't trust Meta to make the right call
> - It usually favors the ad with the most clicks (not CTR)
> - High clicks ≠ high conversions"
> — **@benradack**

**Key Takeaway:** Test in ABO for control. Meta favors total clicks, not conversions.

---

### Batch Testing Strategy
> "How to test 100 ads and find winners fast - 2026 Strategy:
> 1. Launch an ABO and split 100 ads into 4 ad sets of 25 ads each
> 2. Meta will choose 1-2 ads per ad set to spend on
> 3. Give it 3 days minimum to prove those ads out
> 4. If they don't work, kill them and test more"
> — **@benradack**

**Key Takeaway:** Batch test in groups of 25 ads per ad set. Let Meta pick winners, then iterate.

---

### Creative Testing Structure
> "5. Ads testing structure (ABO → CBO):
> - Start with ABO creative testing
> - 1 ad per ad set = isolate variable
> - Scale winning Post IDs into CBO
> - 'Preheating creatives is now Meta-confirmed best practice.'"
> — **@RyanClogg**

**Key Takeaway:** Test in ABO (1 ad/adset), scale winners into CBO using Post IDs.

---

### Don't Over-Test
> "Tag Everyone who STILL says that you should run dozens (or even 100s of ads). The math will FOREVER debunk that scam."
> — **@CTtheDisrupter**

**Key Takeaway:** Quality over quantity. Running hundreds of ads isn't always the answer.

---

## Scaling & Budget

### Simple Account Structure
> "If you're spending less than $1k a day, here's how I would structure your ad account:
> → 1 CBO
> → 1-2 ad sets max
> Don't test in ABO and don't run multiple campaigns - it's simply not in your budget."
> — **@benradack**

**Key Takeaway:** Small budgets (<$1k/day) = 1 CBO, 1-2 ad sets max. Keep it simple.

---

### Bid Cap Strategy for Lower CPA
> "I've been testing a new bid cap strategy to lower our client's CPA… and it's working:
> - Set the campaign budget to 3x your desired daily spend
> - Set a bid cap ~20% above your target CPA
> - Use ad set spend limits to cap real spend"
> — **@benradack**

**Key Takeaway:** Bid cap + 3x budget + spend limits = more control over CPA.

---

### One Campaign Strategy
> "I've scaled brands to $1M/m+ using one campaign. No hacks. No crazy structure. Just simple, repeatable profit. It's the only Meta ad campaign you'll ever need."
> — **@CTtheDisrupter**

**Key Takeaway:** Simplicity scales. One well-optimized campaign can hit 7 figures.

---

### Percentage-Based Spend Limits
> "Meta just rolled out percentage-based minimum spend limits for CBO campaigns. Before: You could only set fixed dollar minimums. Now: You can set percentage minimums (25% of total campaign budget). Set 15% minimums instead of fixed amounts—gives Meta flexibility to allocate based on performance."
> — **@therahulissar**

**Key Takeaway:** Use percentage-based minimums to let Meta optimize while ensuring ad sets get tested.

---

### When to Turn Off Ads
> "'Never turn off ads' is just bad advice. Some ads simply don't work—but due to high engagement (likes and comments) Meta keeps spending on that ad. With Andromeda, Meta has gotten better at shifting budget around but it still makes mistakes."
> — **@benradack**

**Key Takeaway:** Turn off ads that get engagement but no conversions. Don't blindly trust Meta.

---

## The Andromeda Algorithm

### What is Andromeda?
> "Facebook just rolled out Andromeda... Meta got insanely good at matching ads to the right users. And that changes everything for how we structure campaigns."
> — **@avcanthony_**

**Key Takeaway:** Andromeda is Meta's biggest algorithm update since iOS 14.5. It fundamentally changes ad matching.

---

### New Approach to Targeting
> "Facebook's new Andromeda algorithm for ads will flip everything.
> - Old way: Pick interests → Hope it works
> - New way: Create diverse content → Let AI find your people
> The algorithm gets smarter than your targeting."
> — **@usamaejaz**

**Key Takeaway:** Stop micromanaging audiences. Feed Andromeda diverse creative and let it find your buyers.

---

### Creative Similarity Detection
> "Meta now treats two ads as 'identical' if they share the similar first 3 seconds... even if the rest is different. Meta flagged several top-performing ads as 'highly similar' even though they featured completely different creators."
> — **@oliverwhudson**

**Key Takeaway:** The first 3 seconds must be unique. Same opening = same ad in Meta's eyes.

---

### Post-Andromeda Testing Strategy
> "Before it made sense to take an angle, create 3-5 ads and test them in a single ad set. Now? Give meta 3 ad sets with 10-15 ads in them, all different formats, different angles, different messaging."
> — **@ashvinmelwani**

**Key Takeaway:** Fewer ad sets, more ads per set. Maximize diversity within each ad set.

---

### Internal Testing Results
> "Meta's internal testing shows promising results:
> - 22% higher ROAS with Advantage+ creative
> - 8% improvement in ad quality
> - 7% increase in conversions using AI-generated images"
> — **@LifeOfSid_**

**Key Takeaway:** Advantage+ and AI-generated images are showing strong results.

---

## AI in Advertising

### AI Tools Tier List (2025)
> "It's been 6 months and a lot has changed, so here's my updated tier list of AI tools in ad creative:
> **S tier:**
> - Claude - all of my copywriting is done in Claude 4 Opus
> - DeepResearch - it's just great
> - Reddit Answers - hugely underrated"
> — **@alexgoughcooper**

**Key Takeaway:** Claude for copy, DeepResearch for insights, Reddit Answers for customer language.

---

### Predictions for AI in Ads (2026)
> "Here are my 10 predictions for ad creative in 2026:
> 1. For the first time ever, AI ads become indistinguishable from human ads
> 2. Production isn't the constraint anymore
> 3. Creative strategy as we know it dies
> 4. The best creative teams won't be 'strategising', they'll be building systems
> - Nano Banana is the best at image gen
> - Veo isn't far behind Sora in video gen"
> — **@alexgoughcooper**

**Key Takeaway:** AI will democratize production. Strategy shifts to building AI systems.

---

### AI Creative Systems
> "We have had significant demand to release our internal creative operations systems:
> - The exact Notion dashboard setup we use to manage 1,000+ ad concepts
> - Our proven creative brief templates for every type of ad
> - The AI cheatsheet with ALL of our AI prompts
> - Our SOP library of 90+ ad creative SOPs"
> — **@alexgoughcooper**

**Key Takeaway:** Build systems (Notion, SOPs, AI prompts) to scale creative production.

---

### Arcads 2.0 for AI Ads
> "I've been a user of arcads from the very beginning and I must say they've always been at the very forefront of AI ad making. Arcads 2.0 is insane."
> — **@alexgoughcooper**

**Key Takeaway:** Arcads 2.0 is leading AI-generated UGC-style ads.

---

### GPT for Creative Output
> "GPT 4.0 has skyrocketed our Facebook Ad creative output over the last 7 days. I put all our use cases + high-level advertising prompts on a 2-page resource."
> — **@nicktheriot_**

**Key Takeaway:** Use GPT-4 with advertising-specific prompts to accelerate creative ideation.

---

## Hooks & Copy

### Hook Rate Definitions
> "Important definitions:
> - **Hook rate** = 3-sec views / impressions
> - **Hold rate** = Thruplay (15-sec views) / impressions
> - **Hook strength** = Thruplay / 3-sec views
> 
> Hook rate is how many people watched 3 seconds
> Hold rate is how many people watched 15 seconds"
> — **@RobertPaidAds**

**Key Takeaway:** Know your metrics. Hook rate ≠ hold rate ≠ hook strength.

---

### Diagnosing Ad Problems
> "If your hook rate is low → Your ad is dead.
> If your hold rate is bad → Your story is boring.
> If your CTR is weak → Your offer is unclear."
> — **@sourfraser**

**Key Takeaway:** Low hook = bad opening. Low hold = boring middle. Low CTR = unclear offer.

---

### 50 Tested Hooks
> "I have tested THOUSANDS of hooks over the past few years. Some died in 48 hours. Some are still running 18 months later. So I've compiled 50 that actually stop the scroll and convert, organised by awareness stage, product category, and format type."
> — **@sourfraser**

**Key Takeaway:** Organize hooks by awareness stage and format for systematic testing.

---

### UGC Hook Templates
> "UGC ads are one of the most effective formats for paid social. Here are 3 hooks:
> 1. **The 'X Reasons Why' hook** - 'x reasons why…' followed by interesting fact/insight
> 2. Creates curiosity and promises value
> 3. Works across all awareness levels"
> — **@stackedmarketer**

**Key Takeaway:** "X Reasons Why" is a proven hook structure for UGC.

---

### Thumb Stop Strategy
> "Try THIS if you want to increase your ad's thumb stop: Show a video being recorded from the POV of someone recording the person filming AND the actual recording itself."
> — **@social_savannah**

**Key Takeaway:** Meta-content (recording of recording) stops the scroll.

---

## UGC & Creator Content

### The Problem with Fake UGC
> "'Fake' UGC ads from Billo are taking over my feeds. I keep seeing the same creators over and over again. The same gal for THREE different brands. Consumers will catch on."
> — **@candacewwu**

**Key Takeaway:** Overused UGC creators hurt credibility. Diversify your creator pool.

---

### Landing Page Congruence
> "Running clickbait UGC that gets high engagement but terrible conversion rates? Build landing pages that match what your ad promised. It needs to fill the gaps your ad left behind."
> — **@sourfraser**

**Key Takeaway:** Ad-to-landing-page congruence is critical. Don't overpromise in ads.

---

## Metrics & Analysis

### Custom Metrics for CVR & AOV
> "Your ad has a great hook rate, good hold, good CTR, but ROAS still sucks? Set up custom metrics:
> - CVR = purchases / landing page views
> - AOV = purchase conversion value / purchases
> 
> When this happens, it's not about your ad—it's about congruency between ad and landing page."
> — **@williamkast_**

**Key Takeaway:** Build custom CVR and AOV metrics. Low ROAS with good engagement = landing page problem.

---

### Actions/Reach Metric
> "Mini Meta Ads Hack: If you have tried a ton of different interests and look a like audiences…
> Create a custom metric: Actions / Reach
> This way you'll see which target audience & which ad inside that audience had the highest CVR and then just recycle"
> — **@MarketingMax**

**Key Takeaway:** Actions/Reach reveals which audience-ad combinations convert best.

---

### Spending Control by Creative
> "The goal is to make as many scalable ads as possible. That's why we measure creative sources by percentage of spend in the account controlled - I think it's a way more reliable metric to assess who is making more scalable, long-term ads."
> — **@alexgoughcooper**

**Key Takeaway:** Measure creative sources by % of spend controlled, not just hit rate.

---

### Hit Rate vs % of Spend
> "I've always thought that hit rate is a weird metric to measure creative sources by. What counts as a 'hit'? Does that change as the business grows? If there's one strategist putting out 50 ads/week at a 20% hit rate, is that worse than another one who makes 5 ads at a 40% hit rate?"
> — **@alexgoughcooper**

**Key Takeaway:** % of spend controlled > hit rate as a creative success metric.

---

## Account Structure

### CBO vs ABO Debate
> "I saw people arguing about running a 1 CBO campaign structure VS running 1 testing ABO & a scaling CBO / ADV+ campaign structure. What almost never works: The setup with Cost Capped CBOs (A ton of campaigns with 3-5 ads per campaign)."
> — **@williamkast_**

**Key Takeaway:** Avoid fragmented Cost Cap CBOs. Consolidate for better performance.

---

### Standard Test Structure
> "First, the standard Creative Test campaign:
> - 1 campaign, CBO
> - Unique adset for each concept
> - Add a spend minimum to each adset so it MUST spend a minimum of $X per day
> Next, scale your winners into a normal Scale campaign."
> — **@peterczepiga**

**Key Takeaway:** Test campaign (CBO with minimums) → Scale campaign (winners graduate).

---

### Simplicity Wins
> "One CBO, whenever possible. Bid Caps. Launch new creative into that CBO in new ad sets and at the same Bid Cap as your others. Winners will rise to the top. The same principles apply for ASC."
> — **@andrewjfaris**

**Key Takeaway:** Simple structure: One CBO, Bid Caps, new creative in new ad sets.

---

### 10 Common Mistakes
> "10 Most Common Mistakes Ecom Brands are doing with their FB Ads:
> - Not using proper UTM tracking
> Use this template: ?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign={{campaign.name}}&utm_term={{adset.name}}&utm_content={{ad.name}}"
> — **@IstvanicMarin**

**Key Takeaway:** Always use proper UTM parameters for tracking attribution.

---

## Tools & Resources

### Competitive Research
> "I'm building my own ad tracking software. Users add a competitor from the dashboard. The app triggers browser agents that visit Meta, Google, and LinkedIn ad libraries, scrape visible ads, and a GPT agent analyzes the ad strategy."
> — **@TakoTreba**

**Key Takeaway:** Build or use tools that scrape ad libraries and analyze competitor strategies.

---

### AI Ad Cloner
> "Just Shipped: The AI Ads Cloner. You can now clone any ad with AI in just one click. Can be done from the 'Clone Ad' button in the Facebook Ads library."
> — **@nico_jeannen**

**Key Takeaway:** Use AI tools to quickly iterate on proven competitor ads.

---

### Creative Analytics
> "So... I made an AI Agent for Meta Ads creative analysis. If you're a creative strategist, media buyer, or anyone analyzing Meta Ads creative, this is for you."
> — **@DenneyDara**

**Key Takeaway:** AI agents can automate creative analysis at scale.

---

### Motion for Creative Strategy
> "Creative is the biggest lever in paid advertising. Full stop. Our team built a game-changing creative analytics purpose-built for creative strategists."
> — **@motionapp_**

**Key Takeaway:** Motion is the leading creative analytics tool for performance marketers.

---

## Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns

### ASC Performance Debate
> "Which Meta campaigns perform best: BAU (business as usual) or ASC+ (Advantage+ shopping)? At Kynship, we have insight into over $350M in ad spend for ecommerce brands. The answer? Neither. [Context matters]"
> — **@TaylorLagace**

**Key Takeaway:** ASC vs BAU depends on your specific situation. Test both.

---

### ASC Bid Strategies
> "Previously, ASCs solely supported the highest volume bid strategy, but with these new features, advertisers can now use Cost Caps and ROAS Goal. Being able to test Value-Based Optimization is a huge update."
> — **@max_rosewater**

**Key Takeaway:** ASC now supports Cost Caps and ROAS goals—test Value-Based Optimization.

---

### Target ROAS for Better AOV
> "Meta Ads bidding nuance that most people miss: Using highest volume asks Meta to predict just two variables: ad spend and # of purchases. Target ROAS introduces a third variable: order value. It forces Meta to factor in how much they are likely to spend with your brand."
> — **@andrewjfaris**

**Key Takeaway:** Use Target ROAS to optimize for higher AOV, not just conversion count.
