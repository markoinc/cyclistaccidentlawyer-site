## Notes

### Tab Order Fix
The original sheet had Personal (0068) as tab index 1, before Business (4991). This was corrected to match the standard template order.

### Corrected Profit Numbers
Per special notes, profit was corrected to $2,715.00 (42.92% margin). The dashboard Section D already reflected these corrected numbers.

### January 2026 Forecast Preserved
The unique "January 2026 Forecast" section (Section H) in the dashboard was preserved with proper formatting. It details ~$2,611.61 in projected monthly savings from cancelled/reduced services.

### Income Classification
December saw increased MVA activity:
- **Stripe income ($2,575.59):** Mix of 🏗️ Rank & Rent and 🚗 MVA
- **Zelle income ($3,750.00):** ACI Enterprise ($3,000) + Anthony Reddin ($250) + ACI ($500)
- **Anthony Reddin:** First appears in December — likely 🚗 MVA client
- **Alexander Shtabsky $500:** Correctly excluded — personal ATM cash favor in Peru

### Elective and Exa.ai
Two major expense items ($816.67 + $491.90 = $1,308.57) were one-time/cancelled, explaining the high expense month. Both confirmed eliminated for January.
