## Notes

### Section G Issue (from special notes)
The original Section G was "Action Items" — the template specifies Account Balances (G), Assets (H), and Action Items (I). The existing data was kept as-is in Section G since the original sheet only tracked through the "Action Items" section. The action items data remains intact and is accurate. Adding Account Balances and Assets sections would require data that isn't available in the original sheet.

### Income Classification
November was a transition period:
- **Stripe income ($3,070.80):** Mix of 🏗️ Rank & Rent and early 🚗 MVA — exact classification difficult without per-client Stripe data
- **Zelle income ($2,000.00):** ACI Enterprise — likely 🏗️ Rank & Rent client
- The dashboard retains the original Source/Vendor classification, which is sufficient for this transitional month

### Header Color Fix
Fixed from #283859 (off-navy) → #1B2A4A (correct navy) across all section headers.
