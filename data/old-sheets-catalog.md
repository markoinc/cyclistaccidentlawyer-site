## Data Quality Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **Inconsistent income tracking** — June includes "Zelle (hooked commissions)" $1,530 and "Zelle (SEO Service)" $2,475 as separate income sources in Total Business Income ($9,022.51) but these don't add up to the stated total. The Overview says $9,022.51 but Stripe ($4,142.51) + Zelle ($3,350) + commissions ($1,530) = $9,022.51 ✓. The SEO $2,475 appears to be double-counted or from Zelle client subs.
2. **August Overview incomplete** — Pre-tax profit and debt payoff not calculated. Personal summary categories listed but not filled in.
3. **Duplicate data everywhere** — Every transaction tab has a sidebar that duplicates the Overview summary data. Changes in one place aren't reflected in others.

### Structural Issues
4. **No consistent categorization system** — Each expense is labeled ad hoc (e.g., "Netipaulyu?", "salon?", "idk what for")
5. **Business/personal split is manual and inconsistent** — Some expenses have Rank&Rent vs SEO allocation columns (June CC tab), others don't (July/August)
6. **Transfers are messy** — Many small daily transfers ($100-$350) from Biz to Personal, making it hard to track actual spending vs. movement
7. **Mixed business/personal in business account** — Affirm mattress ($179.65) and Triwest health insurance ($404.39) paid from Biz 4991 in August
8. **No formula-driven totals** — Summaries appear to be manually typed, not calculated from transaction data
9. **Cancelled subscriptions still tracked** — Items marked "cancelled" remain in the expense list with amounts

### Format Issues
10. **No consistent column structure** — Overview tabs are free-form layouts, not structured tables
11. **Currency formatting inconsistent** — Mix of "$4,142.51" and "4142.51" and "-$15.23" and "-15"
12. **Date format varies** — "6/1/2025" vs "06/01/2025" vs "6/5/2025"
13. **Sidebar categories don't match bank CSV categories** — Bank says "Professional Services", sidebar says "hosting"
14. **Tab order inconsistent** — June has CC before 4991, July/August have 4991 before CC

### Missing Data
15. **No tax withholding tracking** — June has $400 to tax account, August has $700, July has $0. No running tax liability estimate.
16. **No accounts receivable** — No tracking of expected income or outstanding invoices
17. **No Discover CC data** — Payments to Discover are tracked but no transaction imports from Discover card
18. **No savings account transactions** — Transfers to/from savings 7036 noted but no savings tab

## Categorization Methods Used

### Business Expense Categories (from Overview tabs)
Current approach: **Each expense listed by vendor name** with optional tags:
- `recurring` — monthly subscription
- `cancelled` — was recurring, now cancelled
- `variable` — one-time or irregular
- No standardized category taxonomy

### Revenue Categories
- Stripe (client subscriptions)
- Zelle (client subscriptions)
- Zelle (hooked commissions)  
- Zelle (SEO service)
- Sometimes split into Rank & Rent vs SEO

### Personal Expense Categories (from July Overview, most complete)
- Crypto investing
- Stock investing
- CC Payments
- Loan payments
- Kitty (cat expenses)
- To Magen
- Weed/Vape
- Shopping
- Entertainment
- Gym
- Eating out/drinks
- Groceries
- Rent & maintenance
- Utilities
- Transportation

### Keeper 1099 Categories (IRS Schedule C)
For reference, the proper tax categories from the Keeper sheet:
- Advertising, Car/truck expenses, Contract labor, Insurance, Legal/professional, Office expenses, Supplies, Taxes/licenses, Travel, Deductible meals, Wages, Home office, Other (Software, Phone, Digital payments)

---

## Notes for Redesign

### What Needs to Change
1. **Structured, formula-driven Overview** — Replace free-form layout with calculated summaries from transaction data
2. **Consistent categorization** — Create a standardized category dropdown for both business and personal expenses
3. **Eliminate sidebar duplication** — Transaction tabs should have raw data only; Overview should pull from them
4. **Proper business/personal separation** — Clear rules for what goes in which account
5. **Automated totals** — All summary numbers should be SUMIF/SUMIFS formulas
6. **Tax tracking** — Monthly tax set-aside calculation based on income
7. **Debt payoff tracking** — Monthly progress chart with targets
8. **Income source tracking** — By client, not just by payment method
9. **Expense allocation** — Proper Rank & Rent vs SEO vs Personal split
10. **Consistent formatting** — Standard currency format, date format, column headers

### What Works Well (Keep)
- 4-account structure (Biz checking, Biz CC, Personal checking, Personal CC)
- Monthly net worth tracking
- Debt utilization tracking (introduced in July)
- Profit margin calculation
- Asset tracking (crypto, stocks, business equity)
- Recurring vs. variable expense flags

### Account Changes to Note
- **Boost Mobile** — Cancelled by August
- **Several AI subs churned** — Midjourney, CTR Manipulation, Kevin's PBN cancelled in June; Grok cancelled after July; Claude kept
- **Google Ads** — Running heavy in August ($340), then cancelled
- **Elite North Shore gym** — $191.36/mo, noted "cancel!! follow up" in July
- **Health insurance** — Triwest appears first in August ($404.39)
- **Affirm mattress** — New $179.65/mo payment starting August
