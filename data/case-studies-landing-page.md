## 1. Texas PI Firm — The Long Game

> "We've been working together for over four years now. In that time, we've signed more than 500 cases through their campaigns. Our acquisition cost hovers around $1,700-$2,000 per signed case — which, if you know Texas PI, is very competitive. They understand the market here and the leads actually convert. Not tire-kickers."

**Key stats:** 4+ years, 500+ cases signed, ~$2k per case

---

## 2. California Mass Tort Firm — Serious Scale

> "We spend $250k a month with them. That's not a typo. When you're operating at our volume, you need a partner who can keep up without quality dropping off a cliff. We've put over $4 million through their system and they still deliver consistent results. Case cost runs around $1,500-$3,000 depending on the campaign, which works for our model."

**Key stats:** $250k/month spend, $4M+ total, 40+ cases/month

## 3. Louisiana Solo Practitioner — Punching Above My Weight

> "I'm not a big firm. It's me and two paralegals. But I've been signing 40+ MVA cases a month since I started working with them back in 2021. My cost per case stays under $2k. That's let me compete with firms that have been around for decades. The leads are local, they're qualified, and my intake team can actually close them."

**Key stats:** 40+ cases/month, <$2k per case, since 2021

## 4. Pennsylvania Injury Attorney — No BS Results

> "I've worked with a lot of lead gen companies. Most of them oversell and underdeliver. These guys are different — they told me I could hit $1,500 per case with aggressive intake, and they were right. My average last year was around $1,850. For the Philadelphia market, that's excellent. They know what they're doing in contract states."

**Key stats:** $1,500-$1,850 per case, 15-20% conversion, PA market

---

## 5. Multi-State Expansion — VA, Ohio, South Carolina

> "We started in one state and now we're running campaigns across three. Since August 2021, we've put over a million dollars into this and signed well over 100 cases. Our CPC is around $1,600-$1,700 in Georgia and SC. The thing I appreciate most? Consistency. Month after month, the numbers hold."

**Key stats:** $1M+ spend, 100+ cases, $1,600-$1,700 CPC, multi-state

## 6. New York Firm — From Small to Scaling

> "We weren't a big firm when we started. Now we're partnering with other firms just to handle the volume. We're signing cases for under $2k — sometimes closer to $1,500 — and the leads convert at about 15%. We went from unknown to well-known in our market, and a lot of that is because we had a steady pipeline feeding us quality cases."

**Key stats:** <$2k per case, 15% conversion, rapid growth

---

## 7. New Mexico — High Value Cases

> "New Mexico isn't the biggest market, but the case values here are insane. We get a lot of trucking cases — and NM trucking cases are four times more likely to involve a fatality than the national average. At $300 per lead and a 15% conversion rate, we're looking at around $2k per signed case. The ROI on high-value cases like these is incredible."

**Key stats:** $300/lead, 15% conversion, ~$2k per case, trucking/high-value focus

---

## 8. National Firm — All 50 States

> "We needed a partner who could scale with us across the entire country. We're running campaigns in all 50 states now — mid-seven figures in annual spend. What impressed me was that they could maintain performance even at that scale. Not many vendors can say that honestly. They've become a core part of our acquisition strategy."

**Key stats:** All 50 states, 7-figure annual spend, consistent national performance
