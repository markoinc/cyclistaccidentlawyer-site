## Notes

### Header Color Fix
The dashboard header was using #3366CC (medium blue) instead of #1B2A4A (navy). This was corrected across all section headers, title, and sub-section headers.

### Most Complete Sheet
January was the most complete sheet in the batch — it already had:
- Correct tab names and order
- Profit First tab with detailed implementation plan
- Pareto Analysis with SaaS classification
- Raw Data tab with original bank descriptions

- Multi-card Meta Ads tracking

Primary work was formatting standardization (colors, fonts, column widths).

  - Christian Willard: $700 — 🚗 MVA client
  - Jonathan Bible: $500 — 🚗 MVA client
- **Other ($100):** Credit Strong refund

### Stripe Capital Loan
- Received: $4,200 on 01/23/2026 — correctly excluded from revenue
- Total to repay: $5,035 (19.9% effective rate)
- Repayment: 20% auto-deducted from Stripe payouts
- January repayment: $120.43
- Remaining: $4,914.57

### Meta Ads Across Multiple Cards
January saw Meta Ads charged across 3 cards totaling $5,984.18:
