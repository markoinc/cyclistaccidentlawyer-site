## 1. Agency-by-Agency Pricing

### Rankings.io (Premium, PI-Focused)
- **Minimum monthly retainer:** $10,000/mo
- **Annual range:** $50,000–$199,999/year ($4,167–$16,666/mo), with some projects **exceeding $200K/year**
- **Typical client:** Mid-to-large PI firms in competitive metros willing to invest aggressively
- **MRR (as of 2022):** ~$650K (entire agency)
- **Team:** 40+ specialists
- **Positioning:** The most recognized premium PI-specific SEO agency. Chris Dreyer (founder) has publicly stated "most SEO agencies charge too low"
- **Key quote:** Rankings.io says PI firms should budget "at least $10,000 per month for SEO if you want any meaningful results" in competitive markets
- **Contract:** Custom pricing, long-term commitment expected (12-18 months minimum recommended)
- **Not for:** Solo practitioners or firms with <$10K/mo budgets. Intercore's review explicitly says "most solo practitioners should pursue regional agencies with $3,000–$7,000 monthly minimums"

### Scorpion
- **Monthly management fees:** $3,000–$10,000+ (PLUS separate ad spend)
- **PPC ad spend (additional):** $5,000–$50,000+/mo on top of management fees
- **Total all-in for PI in a big city:** $20,000/mo ($5K management + $15K ad spend cited as example)
- **Annual marketing budget (mid-large firms):** $150,000+
- **Contract length:** 12–24 months with significant early termination penalties
- **Website ownership:** Scorpion retains (proprietary CMS-8 platform — you can't take your site if you leave)
- **Key weakness for SEO:** Multiple sources say Scorpion is primarily PPC-focused, not SEO-first. At lower budgets ($1K-$5K/mo), they reportedly prioritize PPC management over organic optimization
- **Setup fees:** Can be high (website builds range $1K–$200K depending on scope)
- **Note:** GNGF ("Get Noticed Get Found") was acquired by Scorpion — GNGF now redirects to Scorpion's services

### iLawyerMarketing
- **Pricing:** Not publicly listed, but positioned as premium/competitive with Rankings.io
- **Focus:** Personal injury and criminal defense SEO specialists
- **Notable claim:** They argue in-house SEO team would cost "$200K minimum in salary" — implying their services are more cost-effective than hiring internally
- **Client type:** Solo PI attorneys through large firms (e.g., solo PI attorney in Seattle market cited as client success story)
- **Services:** SEO, PPC, video production, web design

### Hennessey Digital
- **Team:** 125+ employees (largest team among PI-focused agencies)

- **Clutch review avg project size:** Reports suggest mid-to-high five figures annually
- **Background:** Founded 2015 by Jason Hennessey. Acquired by Herringbone Digital (PE-backed) in June 2025
- **Client results claimed:** 28-50% traffic lift, page 1 rankings for competitive PI queries, "$1B+ in client results"
- **Approach:** Bundles SEO + PPC rather than standalone SEO
- **Post-acquisition concern:** PE backing may standardize pricing and reduce custom negotiation flexibility

### PaperStreet Web Design
- **SEO campaigns:** "Start at several thousands of dollars" per month (their own words)
- **Estimated SEO range:** $3,000–$10,000/mo based on firm size and market
- **Clutch hourly rate:** $200–$300/hr
- **Clutch project sizes:** $5,000–$400,000
- **Strength:** Known primarily for web design; SEO is secondary
- **Service tiers:** Essentials, Plus, Custom, Enterprise (prices not public)
- **Quote from their site:** "Miami personal injury is a much more competitive market than Des Moines estate planning" — implying PI in competitive markets is at the high end

### Consultwebs
- **Pricing:** Not publicly listed
- **Range (based on their own site):** "A few thousand dollars per month" for smaller/localized efforts, scaling up for competitive PI markets
- **Case study:** Peakstone Law Group saw 243% rise in monthly leads and 71% reduction in cost-per-case
- **Services:** Full-service legal marketing (SEO, PPC, web design, video, social)
- **Positioning:** Mid-tier pricing, full-service

### GNGF (Get Noticed Get Found)
- **Status:** Acquired by Scorpion — no longer independent
- **Legacy pricing:** Was positioned as mid-range for small-to-mid law firms
- **Current:** Redirects to Scorpion's services and pricing

## 2. Reddit & Forum Data

### What Lawyers Actually Report Paying (Direct Quotes from Reddit)

**r/LawFirm — "How much do law firms actually spend on SEO?"** (March 2025)
> "In the personal injury arena, even in a midsized market like a large midwestern city, you can easily spend **5k+ per month** if you are utilizing an SEO company to design and manage your site along with some additional SEO services. Go to the coasts, and it increases quickly."

**r/LawFirm — "Establishing a new firm"** (Nov 2023)
> "A few hundred bucks per month was plenty for me to rank an injury firm in Albuquerque, but ranking in high medical expense areas like Las Vegas is so competitive injury firms are spending **$10,000 per month or more** on just SEO services."

**r/LawFirm — "Monthly Law Firm SEO"** (Dec 2020)
> "For major metropolitan areas it will be at least $3K a month for criminal, as much as **$10K a month for personal injury**. You are lucky to get a call returned and a site on page 5 for $1K a month."

**r/LawFirm — "Personal Injury Marketing"** (Oct 2025)
> Firm reports "paying a lot of money and getting **mediocre results (3:1 ROI)**" on PPC and Facebook ads with some SEO. Other commenters suggest this is actually decent for PPC but SEO should deliver better over time.

**r/LawFirm — "How much are you all paying?"** (June 2025)
> Commenter: "I'm assuming for that kind of price you're in **personal injury or criminal defense in a major city?** Most of our PI and criminal clients require significant resources in terms of SEO and PPC hours."
> Another attorney: "I pay myself $0 and just write a lot of blog posts containing key words."
> Another: "Nothing to be honest. I just did it myself. You could pay a grad student to do what they do for significantly less in my opinion."

**r/LawFirm — "PI lawyers getting cases without spending money"** (July 2024)
> "I have friends that are spending **$10K a month on Google/SEO** so for me, spending some money on professional networking memberships and a few lunch/dinner dates a month really is not a lot of money relative to what's out there."

**r/SEO — "SEO Company failed to do backlinks for 5 months - $5K monthly"** (Jan 2024)
> Commenter: "That depends on the niche. In personal injury **$5K/month won't move any needles.**"

**r/LawFirm — "Unpopular opinion: SEO might be terrible for solos/small firms in big cities"** (May 2025)
> "Most are only paying **$1-2K a month** and get at least 1,000 sessions and 30 leads from SEO a month after a year." (Note: this commenter was likely NOT in PI specifically)

**r/LawFirmMarketing — Local SEO for virtual PI lawyer** (Sep 2025)
> Reference to paying **$1,600/month on local SEO** — described as potentially wasteful for a specialized firm

**r/DigitalMarketing — "Digital marketing for PI lawyers"** (Jan 2026)
> "PI is one of those verticals where almost everything works on paper and still **loses money in practice**. PPC brings volume fast but quality swings wildly. SEO tends to produce better cases long-term, but it is slow and brutally competitive."

**r/Entrepreneur — Chris Dreyer (Rankings.io founder) AMA** (2019)
> "$275K/mo helping lawyers with SEO" — confirmed the PI SEO niche generates significant agency revenue

### Reddit Consensus Summary
- **Small/non-competitive market PI:** $2,000–$5,000/mo
- **Mid-market PI:** $5,000–$10,000/mo
- **Major metro PI (LA, NYC, Houston, Las Vegas):** $10,000–$20,000+/mo
- **Lawyers who DIY:** $0–$500/mo (common among solos who write their own content)
- **General sentiment:** PI lawyers know SEO is expensive but worth it. The skepticism is about finding agencies that actually deliver, not about the investment itself.

## 3. Pricing by Firm Size

### Solo PI Attorney (1 attorney)
| Market Type | Monthly SEO Budget | Annual Spend |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Small/rural market | $1,500–$3,000 | $18,000–$36,000 |
| Mid-size city | $3,000–$5,000 | $36,000–$60,000 |
| Major metro | $5,000–$8,000 | $60,000–$96,000 |

**Notes:**
- Solo PI attorneys in major metros often find SEO prohibitively expensive and rely more on referral networks, networking, and content they create themselves
- Rankings.io explicitly says their service is "not appropriate for firms looking for budget-friendly options" — i.e., most solos
- Many solos spend $0–$2K/mo doing their own SEO (blogging, GBP optimization)
- The realistic entry point for outsourced PI SEO that "moves the needle" is $3,000/mo minimum

### Small PI Firm (2-5 attorneys)
| Market Type | Monthly SEO Budget | Annual Spend |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Small/rural market | $3,000–$5,000 | $36,000–$60,000 |
| Mid-size city | $5,000–$8,000 | $60,000–$96,000 |
| Major metro | $8,000–$15,000 | $96,000–$180,000 |

**Notes:**
- This is the "sweet spot" segment for most legal SEO agencies
- Small PI firms in competitive markets are the bread and butter for agencies like Rankings.io, Hennessey, and iLawyerMarketing
- At $5K-$8K/mo, firms can expect meaningful rankings progress in 6-12 months

### Mid-Size PI Firm (6-20 attorneys)
| Market Type | Monthly SEO Budget | Annual Spend |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Regional presence | $8,000–$15,000 | $96,000–$180,000 |
| Multi-city/state | $15,000–$30,000+ | $180,000–$360,000+ |
| National/mass tort | $20,000–$50,000+ | $240,000–$600,000+ |

**Notes:**
- These firms often have total marketing budgets of $150K-$500K+ annually
- SEO typically represents 40-50% of total marketing spend (MyCase 2025 data)
- Multi-location firms need separate local SEO campaigns per office ($500–$1,000 per location additionally)
- Rankings.io's sweet spot — firms spending $10K-$17K/mo on SEO alone
- Large PI firms dominating markets: Chris Dreyer states some spend "well over $75,000 per month" on content marketing + SEO combined

### Revenue-Based Benchmarks
- SBA recommends 7-8% of revenue on marketing
- Growth-oriented PI firms: 10-12% of gross revenue on marketing (Rankings.io recommendation)
- SEO should be ~40-50% of total marketing budget (MyCase 2025 survey data: 45% allocation to SEO is the norm)
- **Example:** $3M revenue PI firm → $300K-$360K total marketing → $135K-$162K on SEO → **$11,250-$13,500/mo on SEO**

## 4. What's Included at Each Price Point

### $1,000–$2,000/mo (Bare Minimum / Budget)
- Basic on-page SEO (meta tags, titles, headers)
- Google Business Profile setup and basic optimization
- Monthly keyword ranking report
- 1-2 blog posts per month
- Basic citation building/directory listings
- **Reality for PI:** This won't move the needle in any competitive market. Multiple Reddit users and agencies confirm $1K-$2K "won't even get your calls returned" for PI. Only viable in very small, non-competitive markets.

### $3,000–$5,000/mo (Entry-Level Competitive)
- Everything above, plus:
- Keyword research and content strategy
- 2-4 optimized blog posts/month
- Local SEO (GBP optimization, citations, review management)
- Basic technical SEO audits and fixes
- On-page optimization of service pages
- Monthly strategy calls and reporting
- Basic link building (directories, citations)
- **Reality for PI:** Minimum viable investment for mid-size markets. Can work in smaller cities (Albuquerque, Des Moines) but won't compete in major metros. Expect 9-12 months to see page 1 results for medium-difficulty keywords. SerpremeSEO's published packages: Starter ($1,400/mo = 2 blogs, basic SEO), Compete ($2,800/mo = 4 blogs, deeper optimization), Dominate ($3,600/mo = 6-8 blogs with content clusters).

### $5,000–$10,000/mo (Competitive Standard)

- Aggressive link building (guest posts, digital PR, industry placements)
- Competitor analysis and gap analysis
- Technical SEO audits and ongoing fixes
- Schema markup implementation
- Conversion rate optimization
- Bi-weekly strategy calls
- Advanced analytics and attribution tracking
- Local SEO for multiple locations
- **Reality for PI:** This is where most competitive PI firms start seeing real results. Viable for mid-market cities. In large metros, this is still considered entry-level for serious competitors. Reddit consensus: "$5K/mo in PI won't move any needles" in competitive cities, but works well in mid-markets.

### $10,000–$20,000/mo (Premium/Aggressive)
- Everything above, plus:
- Dedicated account team (strategist, content writer, link builder, technical SEO)
- 8+ content pieces/month including long-form guides

- Content acquisition strategies (purchasing already-ranking content)
- Multi-location optimization
- Comprehensive competitive intelligence
- Weekly strategy meetings
- Advanced conversion tracking and closed-loop reporting

### $20,000+/mo (Elite/Market Domination)
- Everything above, plus:
- Full multi-channel integration (SEO + PPC + content + social)
- Multiple city/state campaigns
- Mass tort/national SEO targeting
- Dedicated SEO team members
- Proprietary research and data analysis
- Executive-level reporting and ROI attribution
- Custom tool development
- **Reality for PI:** Reserved for firms targeting multiple markets or mass tort keywords. Some large PI firms spend $50K-$100K+/mo across all digital marketing channels.

### ROI Scenarios (from Acute SEO)

**At $3,000/mo ($36K/year):**
- 6 cases at $30K each → $59,400 in fees → **65% profit**
- 3 cases at $100K each → $99,000 in fees → **175% profit**
- 1 case at $1M → $330,000 in fees → **817% profit**

**At $5,000/mo ($60K/year):**
- 10 cases at $30K each → $99,000 in fees → **65% profit**
- 5 cases at $100K each → $165,000 in fees → **175% profit**
- Break-even: ~6 cases at $30K/each annually

**At $10,000/mo ($120K/year):**
- 6 cases at $100K each → $198,000 in fees → **65% profit**
- 1 case at $1M → $330,000 in fees → **175% profit**
- Break-even: ~12 cases at $30K/each annually

### What "Good" ROI Looks Like
- **Industry benchmark (Legal Brand Marketing):** Successful PI firms see 300-500% returns on SEO
- **Grow Law Firm:** Claims clients see 400-800% ROI within 12 months
- **PriceWeber example calculation:** $135K SEO spend → $1.15M net profit from SEO-generated cases → **751% ROI**
- **Long-term compound ROI:** Some firms report 500-1,000%+ over 3 years
- **Revenue per dollar spent:** Successful campaigns generate **$5-$15 in revenue per $1 spent on SEO**
- **Break-even timeline:** Most firms break even on SEO in 6-12 months
- **Key metric:** Cost per signed case from SEO — top-performing firms track this at $1,500-$3,000 per signed case via SEO

### ROI Timeline
- **Months 1-3:** Foundation work (technical fixes, content strategy, initial optimization). Minimal visible results.
- **Months 4-6:** Rankings climb, 20-40% traffic growth for medium-difficulty keywords
- **Months 7-12:** Sustained results. 50-150% traffic growth. Consistent lead generation begins.
- **Year 2+:** Compounding returns. Cost per lead drops significantly. SEO becomes the most profitable channel.

### What 3:1 ROI Means
One Reddit PI firm described 3:1 ROI as "mediocre" for PPC+SEO combined. The community consensus:
- **3:1 ROI** = acceptable for PPC
- **5:1 ROI** = good target minimum (Rankings.io's recommended LTV:CAC ratio)
- **8:1+ ROI** = excellent / what good SEO delivers over time
- **Pure SEO (organic)** should outperform PPC ROI because you're not paying per click

---

## 6. Local vs National SEO Pricing

### Local SEO (What Most PI Firms Need)
- **Focus:** Ranking in Google Local Pack (map results) + organic results for "[city] personal injury lawyer"
- **Typical spend:** $3,000–$10,000/mo
- **What it includes:** GBP optimization, local citations, review management, city-specific content, local link building
- **Per-location add-on:** $500–$1,000/mo per additional office location
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months for meaningful local rankings

### Regional/Multi-City SEO
- **Focus:** Ranking across multiple cities within a state or region
- **Typical spend:** $8,000–$20,000/mo
- **Complexity:** Each city requires its own content, citations, and potentially its own GBP listing
- **Rankings.io tip:** They recommend "multiple offices in the same city versus multiple cities" to maximize local visibility
- **Example:** PI firm wanting to rank in 5 Texas cities → need ~$10K-$15K/mo minimum

### National/Mass Tort SEO
- **Focus:** Ranking nationally for terms like "mesothelioma lawyer" or "[drug name] lawsuit"
- **Typical spend:** $15,000–$50,000+/mo
- **Competition level:** Extreme — CPC for "mesothelioma lawyer" exceeds $200/click
- **Required strategy:** Massive content production, aggressive link building, strong domain authority
- **Typical client:** Large PI/mass tort firms (Morgan & Morgan, etc.)

### Why Local is (Relatively) More Cost-Effective for PI
- PI cases are inherently local — clients want a lawyer in their city
- Local SEO targets fewer competitors (just lawyers in your metro vs. nationally)
- Local 3-Pack (map results) drives the majority of PI clicks
- 96% of PI clients begin their attorney search online, most with local intent
- **PPC comparison:** "Personal injury lawyer" CPC = $100-$300+ in major metros. SEO delivers the same traffic without per-click costs.

## 7. PI Premium vs Other Practice Areas

### PI is the Most Expensive Legal SEO Vertical

| Practice Area | Monthly SEO Budget Range | CPC (Google Ads) | Competition Level |
|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Personal Injury** | **$8,000–$15,000** | **$100–$300+** | **Extreme** |
| Criminal Defense | $4,000–$8,000 | $50–$150 | High |
| Family Law | $3,500–$6,500 | $30–$80 | Moderate-High |
| Immigration | $2,500–$5,000 | $20–$60 | Moderate |
| Estate Planning | $2,500–$5,000 | $15–$40 | Moderate |
| Bankruptcy | $2,500–$5,000 | $20–$50 | Moderate |
| Workers' Comp | $3,000–$6,000 | $30–$70 | Moderate-High |
| Business/Corporate | $3,000–$7,000 | $25–$80 | Moderate |

**PI SEO costs 2-3x more than estate planning** (Legal Brand Marketing, 2025):
> "Personal injury SEO costs 2-3 times more than estate planning because words like 'car accident lawyer' are expensive—$150-$300 per click—so you need to spend $8,000-$15,000 monthly."

### Why PI Costs More
1. **Highest case values:** Average PI case = $50,000+, with major cases worth $500K-$1M+. This attracts more competition.
2. **Highest keyword costs:** "Car accident lawyer" = $150-$300/click. "Estate planning lawyer" = $15-$40/click.
3. **Most law firms competing:** PI is the largest plaintiff practice area by number of firms
4. **Established competitors:** Major PI firms have been investing in SEO for 10+ years, making it harder for newcomers
5. **High-volume opportunity:** PI cases come in high volume compared to niche practices
6. **Content requirements:** PI requires more content, more frequently, covering dozens of case types (car accidents, truck accidents, slip & fall, medical malpractice, wrongful death, etc.)
7. **Link building difficulty:** Competitive PI markets require aggressive, high-quality link campaigns

### The "PI Tax" on SEO
- A family law firm might rank on page 1 in 6 months with $4K/mo spend
- A PI firm in the same city might need $10K/mo for 12+ months to achieve the same
- **Rough multiplier:** PI SEO costs **2-3x** what comparable less-competitive practice areas cost in the same market

---

## 8. Contract Terms & Setup Fees

### Standard Contract Structures

| Contract Type | Prevalence | Typical Agency |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| **Month-to-month** | Growing trend, especially smaller agencies | Acute SEO, BluShark Digital, many boutique agencies |
| **6-month initial** | Common for mid-tier agencies | Consultwebs, Grow Law, various |
| **12-month** | Most common for premium agencies | Rankings.io, Hennessey Digital, most established agencies |
| **12-24 months** | Enterprise/premium | Scorpion (often 24 months) |

### Setup Fees
- **No setup fee:** Common with month-to-month agencies or those absorbing cost into monthly retainer
- **$1,500–$5,000:** Typical for agencies that do initial audits and strategy development
- **$5,000–$25,000:** Common for agencies including website redesign/optimization in onboarding
- **$50,000–$100,000+:** Rankings.io-recommended budget for full website design + brand positioning + development

### Website Costs (Separate from SEO Retainer)
- Basic law firm website: $5,000–$25,000
- Custom PI website with conversion optimization: $15,000–$50,000
- Premium/enterprise PI website: $50,000–$100,000+ (Rankings.io's recommendation)
- Scorpion websites: $1,000–$200,000 (but you don't own it)

### What to Watch For
1. **Proprietary platform lock-in:** Scorpion builds on their own CMS — if you leave, you lose your entire website and start from scratch
2. **Content ownership:** Ensure you own all content created during the engagement
3. **Early termination fees:** Scorpion and some premium agencies charge significant penalties for early cancellation
4. **Minimum ad spend requirements:** Some agencies require minimum monthly PPC spend on top of management fees
5. **Reporting transparency:** Many agencies don't clearly separate management fees from ad spend

### Industry Trend: Moving Toward Month-to-Month
- Express Legal Funding study: Recommends "short-term contracts that transition into month-to-month engagements" to build trust
- More agencies are offering month-to-month to differentiate from Scorpion's long lock-in contracts
- However, most SEO experts agree 12+ months of commitment is needed for meaningful PI SEO results regardless of contract structure

## 9. Key Takeaways

### The Numbers That Matter for Our Positioning

1. **PI lawyers pay $5K-$15K/mo for SEO in competitive markets** — this is the core range we're targeting
2. **The market leader (Rankings.io) charges $10K+ minimum** — they own the premium tier
3. **There's a gap between $2K-$5K (too cheap for PI) and $10K+ (premium)** — the $5K-$8K range is underserved
4. **SEO CPL for PI is $183 vs $442 for Google Ads** — massive selling point for SEO services
5. **Expected ROI: 5:1 minimum, 8:1+ for good campaigns** — one $100K case pays for years of SEO
6. **PI pays 2-3x more than other practice areas** — the premium is real and justified by case values
7. **12 months is the realistic timeline** — firms need patience and agencies need to set expectations
8. **The average law firm spends $4,889/mo on SEO** — but PI firms spend well above average
9. **Month-to-month contracts are a growing differentiator** — Scorpion's 24-month lock-ins are widely criticized
10. **87% of law firms say online marketing is critical, but only 40% invest in SEO** — massive untapped market

### What PI Lawyers Complain About Most (from Reddit/forums)
- Agencies promising results and not delivering
- Being locked into long contracts with no exit
- Not understanding what they're actually paying for
- Lack of transparency in reporting
- Not being able to attribute cases to SEO spend
- Cookie-cutter strategies that don't account for their specific market
- Agencies that are better at selling than at doing SEO

### Market Opportunity
- Firms charging $2K-$5K often can't actually compete in PI markets
- Premium agencies ($10K+) are out of reach for solo and small firms
