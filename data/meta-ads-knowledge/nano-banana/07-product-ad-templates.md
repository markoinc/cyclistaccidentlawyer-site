## 3-Step Method for Realistic Product Ads

### Step 1: Build a Clean Base Scene

1. Upload your reference image (inspiration or competitor visual)
2. Use Nano Banana Pro to remove the product, text, or distracting elements
3. Keep the lighting, mood, and environment

**Outcome:** A stable visual foundation with correct lighting and depth

### Step 2: Add Key Visual Elements

Inject creative variables that shape your brand style:
- Lighting (golden hour, cool tech, soft lifestyle)
- Color tone and brand palette
- Props (fruits, ice, flowers, tech items)
- Composition changes (centered hero shot, overhead, low angle)

**Outcome:** A unique visual direction that doesn't look AI-generated

### Step 3: Enhance with Micro-Details & Text

Refine with subtle finishing touches:
- Glow highlights
- Condensation droplets
- Splash or motion effects
- Soft shadows and lens flares
- Clean text (slogans, CTA, product name)

**Outcome:** A polished, campaign-ready ad visual
