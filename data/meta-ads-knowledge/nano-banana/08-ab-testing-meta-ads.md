## The Science of Creative A/B Testing

### Establishing Measurable Hypotheses

Every successful A/B test begins with a clear, measurable hypothesis.

**Bad:** "Let's test different images"
**Good:** "Product videos with lifestyle context will generate 25% higher conversion rates than static product images"

### Creating Meaningful Creative Differentiation

Avoid testing variations that are too similar. Each version should represent a distinct creative approach:
- Video versus static formats
- Lifestyle versus product-focused imagery
- Problem-aware versus solution-aware messaging

### Statistical Significance Requirements

- **Minimum test duration:** 7-14 days
- **Minimum conversions per variant:** 100
- Ensures reliable and actionable results
