## How Nano Banana Pro in Topview Works

At its core, this integration bridges the gap between Generative AI and Marketing Workflows.

1. **Input** - You provide the text prompt or reference image.
2. **Process** - Nano Banana Pro generates brand-aligned visuals.
3. **Output** - Direct export to Topview Video Editor or Ads Manager.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open Topview & Select Tool

Log in to your Topview dashboard. Navigate to the Creative Video section and select "AI Image" to launch the generator.

### Step 2: Choose a Creation Mode

You have two powerful ways to create, depending on your starting point:

#### Option A: Text to Image
Best for creating new concepts from scratch.
- Describe product features, background, and mood.
- Use Prompt Enhance to automatically polish your description.

#### Option B: Image Edit
Best for modifying existing assets.
- Upload your own product photo.
- Input a prompt to change the background, lighting, or context.

### Step 3: Select Nano Banana Pro Model

Ensure you select the Nano Banana Pro model from the dropdown for the highest fidelity results. If your prompt is simple, we highly recommend toggling Prompt Enhance on.

### Step 4 & 5: Generate, Refine & Animate

Topview will generate up to 8 variations at once. Click on your favorite version to open the detail view for final checks.

**PRO TIP: Turn Static Images into Video Ads**

Need more than just a picture? You don't need to switch tools. Directly from the preview window, click the "Image to Video" button. Topview will take your high-fidelity Nano Banana Pro image and instantly animate it into a dynamic video ad.

Once satisfied, you can export your assets in high resolution for social media, or continue editing in the Topview Video Editor to add music, voiceovers, and captions.

## Practical Marketing Use Cases

- **E-commerce Launches:** Generate 50+ variations of product shots without booking a photographer.
- **Social Media Campaigns:** Keep your feed fresh with daily content generated in minutes, not hours.
- **A/B Testing:** Quickly create "Dark Mode" vs "Light Mode" ad variants to test conversion rates.
- **Seasonal Promotions:** Instantly add snow, pumpkins, or beach vibes to existing product shots.

## Complete Workflow Example

Edit Prompt:
"Please change the character's outfit to a luxurious emerald-green silk kimono-style wrap dress with intricate gold embroidery... Add glossy black ankle boots and delicate gold drop earrings..."
