**Source:** WordStream
**Type:** Targeting Reference Guide

## Overview

Facebook Ads targeting options provide tons of ways for advertisers to reach potential customers. You can build audiences based on demographics, interests, behaviors, and engagements.

## Three Main Targeting Types

### 1. Detailed Targeting (Demographics, Interests, Behaviors)

#### Age and Gender
- Most foundational demographic targets
- Users provide this info at signup
- Target down to single year of age

#### Demographics
Detailed demographic options include:
- Education level
- Parental status
- Work details
- Financial (income levels by ZIP code - US only)

**How Meta Sources This Data:**
- User-provided profile information
- Ads users click on
- Pages they engage with
- Activities across Meta
- Mobile device and connection speed

#### Interests
Target by topics users like based on content engagement:
- Events
- Pages they've liked
- Content they've engaged with

**Tip:** Search for interests directly rather than browsing dropdowns - many topics don't appear in category lists.

#### Behaviors
Target based on:
- Past purchasing behaviors
- Device type
- Intent data signals
- Gaming activities
- Travel behaviors
- Facebook/Instagram shop payment preferences

### 2. Lookalike Audience Targeting

**How It Works:**
1. Provide Meta a source audience
2. Platform analyzes the list and creates a persona
3. Meta builds audience of similar users

**Source Audience Requirements:**
- Minimum 100 users in a single country
- Recommended: 1,000-5,000 users
- Can use any custom audience type

**Percentage Match:**
- 1% = Top 1% most similar to source
- Higher % = Larger audience, less similar
- Choose based on reach vs. precision tradeoff

**Source Audience Options:**
- Customer lists
- Website visitors
- App users
- Video viewers
- Page engagers
- Lead form submitters

### 3. Meta Advantage+ Audience (AI Targeting)

Meta's machine learning does targeting automatically using:
- Past conversion performance
- Your pixel data
- User interactions with previous ads
- Other advertiser ads on platform

**How It Works:**
- Start with your audience suggestions (optional)
- Meta starts there, then expands based on patterns
- Less control, but often better optimization

**When to Use:**
- Testing when you don't have established benchmarks
- Accounts with strong pixel data
- When manual targeting isn't performing

**Important:** These are suggestions, not restrictions. Meta will branch out from your suggestions.

## Best Practices for Targeting

### Narrow Audience Strategy
- Not everyone is your ideal customer
- Narrower targeting = higher conversion rates
- Don't be so specific you limit ad delivery

### Test Different Audiences
- Same ad may perform differently across audiences
- Don't scrap ads - test them on different segments

### Don't Forget Current Customers
- Retargeting existing customers often converts better
- They already know and trust your brand

### AND-OR Logic
- **AND** = Must match ALL criteria
- **OR** = Match ONE OR MORE criteria
- Double-check before spending money
