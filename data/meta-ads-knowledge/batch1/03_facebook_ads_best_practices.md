**Source:** LocaliQ
**Type:** Best Practices Guide

## Targeting Best Practices

### Do: Stick with a Narrow Audience
- Not everyone is your ideal customer
- Narrower targeting = higher conversion rates
- Find the sweet spot between broad and specific

### Do: Test Different Audiences
- Same ad might work for one segment but not another
- Change targeting settings and test before scrapping ads

### Don't: Focus Only on Potential Customers
- Retarget people familiar with your business
- Previous customers may convert easier
- Earn easy wins while building trust with new audiences

### Don't: Confuse AND-OR Logic
- **AND** = All characteristics must match
- **OR** = One or more criteria match
- Double-check before spending money

## Copywriting Best Practices

### Experiment with Length
- Short copy isn't always better
- High-ticket items may need longer explanations
- Test longer and shorter variations

### Use Social Proof
- Mention positive reviews and ratings
- Include customer testimonials
- Build trust with real feedback

### Mention Your Location
- Local businesses: make location clear immediately
- Helps interested local customers take notice

### State a Clear Call to Action
- Don't assume people know what to do
- Give clear, specific instructions
- Reinforce benefits of taking action

**Example:** Instead of "Contact us" → "Call us at 1 (234) 567-8910 for your free 30-minute consultation!"

### Test Emojis
- Capture attention
- Make copy stand out
- Humanize your brand
