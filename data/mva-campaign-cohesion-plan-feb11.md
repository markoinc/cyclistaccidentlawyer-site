# MVA Campaign Cohesion Plan — February 11, 2026

**Objective:** Align ALL campaign assets around the **SIGNED CASES** offer
**Future Guarantee:** 10 signed cases in 30 days (HOLD — not deployed yet)
**Created by:** Sierra

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC SHIFT: LEADS → CASES

### The Change
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Mixed messaging (leads, transfers, cases) | **CASES ONLY** |
| FAQ about leads/transfers | FAQ about signed cases |
| $2k blended pricing | **$3k average for signed cases** |
| Conversion rates mentioned | We handle conversion — you receive cases |

### Core Message (Everywhere)
> "We don't sell leads. We deliver signed MVA cases."

## 📋 AUDIT: FINAL ADS DOC (1000-position-test-final-feb11.md)

### What's Working ✅

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| $3k signed case pricing | ✅ Aligned | Matches new cases focus |
| 87% retention stat | ✅ Strong | Good trust signal |
| MVA-trained intake | ✅ Aligned | Emphasizes our team closes |
| 10+ cases/month qualifier | ✅ Good | Filters for right clients |
| "No retainer, no setup fees" | ✅ Keep | Strong objection handler |
| Creative style (Ad #18b) | ✅ Winning | Dark, data-driven aesthetic |

### Issues to Fix ⚠️

| Issue | Location | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| 30-50% conversion rate in LP | Hero section | REMOVE — we handle conversion, client doesn't care |
| LP doesn't have 10+ qualifier | Hero | ADD "For firms signing 10+ cases/month" |
| "Apply" CTA implies rejection | CTA button | CHANGE to "Check Market Availability" |
| Mix of Offer 1 (cases) + Offer 2 (leads) | Campaign plan | **SIMPLIFY to cases only** |

### Recommendation: SINGLE OFFER FOCUS

**REMOVE Offer 2 (leads) from campaign entirely.** Why:
1. Confuses messaging
2. Attracts wrong audience (firms with strong intake)
3. Dilutes the unique value prop (we close cases)
4. Creates pricing confusion ($2k leads vs $3k cases)

**Keep ONLY:** Signed cases at ~$3k average

## 📋 AUDIT: LANDING PAGE (kuriosbrand.com)

Based on Feb 10 audit findings + new cases focus:

### Critical Changes Needed 🚨

| Section | Current | Change To |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Hero headline** | Generic | **"We Sign MVA Cases. You Receive Them."** |
| **Hero subheadline** | "Avg $2k cost per closed case" | **"~$3,000 per signed case. No leads. No intake burden."** |
| **Hero CTA** | "Apply to Sign More Cases" | **"Check If Your Market Is Available"** |
| **Conversion rate** | "30-50% conversion rate" | **REMOVE** (we handle this) |
| **Qualifier** | Not shown | ADD: "For PI firms signing 10+ MVA cases/month" |

### Section-by-Section Fixes

**1. Hero Section**
```
BEFORE: "END-TO-END CASE ACQUISITION FOR PI FIRMS"
AFTER:  "WE SIGN MVA CASES. YOU RECEIVE THEM."

BEFORE: "Avg $2k cost per closed case"
AFTER:  "~$3,000 per signed case | We handle intake | You focus on cases"

ADD: "For PI attorneys signing 10+ cases/month"
```

**2. Trust Bar**
- Keep 87% retention ✅
- Keep TCPA compliance ✅
- REMOVE conversion rate stat
- ADD: "100% exclusive — one firm per market"

**3. Service Tiers**
- **REMOVE Tier 1 (leads) and Tier 2 (transfers)**
- Keep ONLY Tier 3 (Signed Cases) — but don't call it "Tier 3"
- Rename to: **"Signed Cases — Our Core Offer"**
- Pricing: "~$3,000 avg per signed case (varies by state/volume)"

**4. How It Works**
Update to reflect CASES only:
1. **We Fund Marketing** — Meta ads, creative, targeting
2. **We Generate Demand** — MVA prospects in your market
3. **We Close Retainers** — PI-trained intake signs cases
4. **You Receive Cases** — Signed, verified, ready to work

**5. FAQ Section**
- Replace with new FAQ (02-faq-table-cases.txt)
- All answers about CASES, not leads

**6. Client Results Carousel**
- Update copy to show "cost per signed case" not "cost per lead"
- Remove any lead-based metrics
- Show: State, # Cases Signed, Avg Cost Per Case

---

## 📝 UPDATED AD COPY FRAMEWORK

### Remove From All Ads
- Any mention of "leads" (except to contrast: "not just leads")
- "15% conversion rate (you handle intake)" — NO, we close
- Tier 1/Tier 2 language
- $2k pricing (use $3k)

### Keep In All Ads
- PI ATTORNEYS / FOR PI LAW FIRMS (opener)
- 10+ cases/month qualifier
- $3k average cost per signed case
- 87% retention stat
- "We fund marketing, we close retainers"
- "No retainer, no setup fees"
- One firm per market exclusivity

### Updated Ad Template

```
**Opener:** PI ATTORNEYS signing 10+ cases/month:

**Hook:** [Pain point about lead quality / intake burden / vendor trust]

**Pivot:** Here's the real solution — stop receiving leads entirely.

**Offer:** We fund the marketing. We generate MVA prospects. Our PI-trained intake team qualifies and closes retainers on your behalf. You don't touch a case until it's already signed.

**Proof:** ~$3,000 average cost per signed case. 87% of law firms stay with us year after year.

**Risk reversal:** No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

**Scarcity:** One firm per market. Once your market is taken, your competitors can't work with us.

**CTA:** [Check availability / See if your market is open]
```

**Guarantee Copy (Draft — Hold):**
```
🎯 THE 10-CASE GUARANTEE

We'll deliver 10 signed MVA cases in your first 30 days — or we keep working for free until we hit that number.

Requirements:
- Respond to case deliveries within 24 hours
- Provide feedback on case quality within 48 hours
- Don't modify intake processes without telling us

This isn't a discount. This isn't a credit. It's a guarantee that we'll deliver.

If we can't sign 10 cases in your market in 30 days, we don't deserve your business.
```

**Why wait to deploy:**
1. Need baseline data on current conversion
2. Need to verify we can consistently hit 10/30 days
3. Guarantee is powerful — use it strategically when scaling

## 💡 KEY INSIGHT

**The shift from "leads" to "cases" isn't just copy — it's positioning.**

Leads = commodity (everyone sells them)
Cases = outcome (only we deliver this)

By focusing entirely on signed cases:
- We escape the lead vendor comparison trap
- We justify premium pricing ($3k vs $200 leads)
- We own the entire value chain
- We create a moat competitors can't cross

The guarantee (10 cases in 30 days) becomes the ultimate proof of this promise — but only after the foundation is solid.
