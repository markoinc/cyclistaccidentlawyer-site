## ✅ MESSAGE MATCH ANALYSIS

| Element | Ads | Landing Page | Match |
|---------|-----|--------------|-------|
| Signed case pricing | $3,000 avg | $3,000 avg (Hero + Tier 3) | ✅ MATCH |
| Tier pricing | $2k / $2.5k / $3k | $2k / $2.5k / $3k | ✅ MATCH |
| 87% retention | All ads mention | Trust bar shows | ✅ MATCH |
| MVA-trained intake | All ads say MVA | LP says "MVA-trained" in Hero | ✅ MATCH |
| 10+ cases/month | All ads include | LP does NOT mention | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| Exclusivity | "100% exclusive" | FAQ: "100% exclusive" | ✅ MATCH |
| No retainer | All ads | Hero checkmarks | ✅ MATCH |
| TCPA/compliance | Some ads | Hero + Trust bar | ✅ MATCH |

**Issue Found:** LP hero still says "30-50% conversion rate" — this was removed from ads per directive. Consider removing from LP for full consistency.

## 🎯 AUDIENCE FILTER EFFECTIVENESS

### Qualifier: "PI ATTORNEYS signing 10+ cases/month"

**Projected filter rates by segment:**

| Segment | See Ad | Click | LP | Book Call | Filter Stage |
|---------|--------|-------|----|-----------| -------------|
| Solo attorneys (<5 cases/mo) | 100% | 40% | 20% | 5% | ✅ Filtered at ad |
| Small firms (5-10 cases/mo) | 100% | 70% | 60% | 40% | ⚠️ Borderline |
| Mid-size (10-30 cases/mo) | 100% | 85% | 80% | 65% | ✅ Target |
| Large firms (30+ cases/mo) | 100% | 90% | 85% | 75% | ✅ Target |
| Non-lawyers | 100% | 15% | 5% | <1% | ✅ Filtered at ad |

**Verdict:** "10+ cases/month" qualifier effectively filters solos and non-targets. "PI ATTORNEYS" opener catches attention of target, repels non-lawyers.

## 💰 PRICING PERCEPTION TEST

### Simulated responses to $3k signed case price:

| Firm Type | Reaction | Likelihood to Book |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Solo** | "Too expensive for my volume" | 15% |
| **Small (5-10)** | "Interesting but need to see ROI" | 45% |
| **Mid-size (10-30)** | "Competitive with what we're paying" | 70% |
| **Large (30+)** | "If they deliver, this is a deal" | 80% |

**Key insight:** $3k is a "Goldilocks" price — expensive enough to signal quality, cheap enough vs. industry ($5k+) to be attractive.

### Tier pricing clarity:
- Leads $2k → Clear value for self-closers
- Transfers $2.5k → Middle ground understood
- Signed $3k → Premium tier = premium service

**No confusion detected.** Each tier has distinct value prop.

## 🔄 CONVERSION FUNNEL ANALYSIS

### Click → Landing Page → Book Call Journey:

**Step 1: Ad Click**
- Hook effectiveness: 9/10 (emotional hooks, pain points)
- Qualifier clarity: 9/10 (10+ cases/month filters well)
- CTA alignment: 8/10 (soft CTAs in ads, "Apply" on LP)

**Step 2: Landing Page Arrival**
- Message continuity: 9/10 (pricing matches, value prop consistent)
- Trust signals: 9/10 (87% retention, compliance badges, client results)
- Friction points: 7/10 (one issue below)

**Step 3: Book Call**
- CTA clarity: 8/10 ("Apply to Sign More Cases" is clear but "Apply" implies possible rejection)
- Form friction: Unknown (would need to test qualify page)

### Friction Point Identified:
LP hero mentions "30-50% conversion rate" but this stat was REMOVED from ads. Visitor may wonder: "Wait, they said nothing about conversion rate in the ad — is this bait?"

**Recommendation:** Either add 30-50% to ads OR remove from LP. Consistency matters.

## 🚨 ISSUES FOUND

### Critical (Fix Now): 0

### Important (Fix Soon): 1

1. **LP/Ad mismatch on conversion rate**
   - LP Hero: "30-50% conversion rate"
   - Ads: Not mentioned (per directive)
   - Risk: Prospects may feel misled
   - Fix: Remove from LP hero OR add to select ads

### Minor (Consider): 2

1. **10+ qualifier not on LP**
   - Ads filter for 10+ cases/month
   - LP welcomes all firm sizes
   - Risk: Solos may still book calls
   - Fix: Add qualifier to LP hero or CTA

2. **"Apply" CTA implies rejection**
   - Current: "Apply to Sign More Cases"
   - Better: "Check Market Availability" (adds scarcity)
   - Risk: Some prospects may not click due to fear of rejection
