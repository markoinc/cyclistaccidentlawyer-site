|--------|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| Revenue | "chillin at $4k/mo" | $6,325.59 | ❌ UNDERSTATED |

**Tweet said ~$4k/mo but actual was $6,325.** Delta: ~$2,325 understated.

- Or referring to recurring Stripe/subscription revenue only ($2,575 Stripe), which with Zelle is still $6.3k
- New Zelle clients appeared: Anthony Reddin ($250) and Alexander Shtabsky ($500)

Tweet (Dec 19): "I'm building a $9.6M lead gen biz this year" — Aspirational, not a financial claim.
Tweet (Dec 19): "Mark my words In 30 days I will be back over $10k/mo" — ✅ January came in at $9,321.79 (close, depending on timing)

## 🔑 Summary

### What's Accurate ✅
- **Revenue top-lines are generally correct** — June and July revenue match to the penny
- **Income source breakdowns are accurate** — R&R, commissions, SEO splits all check out
- **July was the best month** — $12,688 confirmed
- **Debt claims are roughly accurate** — CC debt and student loans consistent with accounting

### What's Off ❌
1. **June profit overstated by ~$980** — Tweeted $5,748.76 profit vs $4,769 actual (21% inflated)
2. **December revenue understated by ~$2,325** — Tweeted "$4k/mo" but actual was $6,325
3. **May profit inconsistent between own tweets** — $5,847 vs "$5,500" (4-day gap)

### Missing Data
- **No May 2025 spreadsheet** in Drive
- **No October 2025 spreadsheet** in Drive
- **August-November had zero tweets** with financial numbers — these were declining months ($7.8k → $6.5k → $5.0k)

### The Narrative Gap
Marko tweeted actively about numbers during growth (May-July) and went silent during decline (Aug-Nov). The last number tweet before the pivot was July ($12.7k). By November, revenue had dropped 60% to $5.1k — but no public update was posted. This creates a misleading impression of sustained growth for anyone following the account.
