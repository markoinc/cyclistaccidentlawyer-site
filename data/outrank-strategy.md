# 🏆 MVA Lead Gen Market Domination Strategy

**Mission:** Own the "MVA lead generation" search landscape on Google AND ChatGPT  
**Primary Target:** Beat Quintessa Marketing, Clio's listicle, and all competitors  
**Date:** 2026-02-01

---

## Executive Summary

The MVA lead gen vendor space is ripe for disruption:
- **Primary competitor Quintessa** has serious reputation issues ("The Great Deceiver")
- **Existing listicles** are pay-to-play affiliate content (Clio, LegalClerk.ai)
- **No honest, independent review site** exists for PI/MVA lead vendors
- **AI search is emerging** - first mover advantage available

**The Play:** Build the most trusted, honest review site that attorneys actually reference, then monetize through exclusive partner referrals.
