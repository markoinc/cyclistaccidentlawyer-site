## Pipeline Overview

**[00:00]**  
Okay, Mark. So I just want to show you something. Uh, so I created this simple pipeline. Uh, we have call booked, call no show, call completed, call completed second call, contract sent, and deal one. So just a few stages so that we don't make it too complicated.

But, um, what we want to automate is when a lead comes in and booked a call, you are going to put them right away into this bucket, into the call booked bucket, right? Um, so ideally, the system automatically is going to, is going to create this property here. So if you can automate that, that would be great.

## Call Completion Automation

**[00:42]**  
And then if we have the call, we, we come and manually do call completed. Um, and then we, we would automate whatever comes out of the call, like either is DocuSign or either is more information. So we might want to have like a couple properties where, okay, call successful and then send DocuSign or call need a second call. So we probably need to think about how to automate that.

## Second Call & Contract Flow

**[01:12]**  
Um, and then, um, the same for the second call, whether it's successful or not. If it is successful, send DocuSign. Um, and then we can have there after the call is successful, we have contract, we send the contract, and then this should have an automation to send the reminders, uh, for to get the contract signed. And then when we get the contract signed, it should update the deal as one, right?

---

## Deal Lost & Nurturing

**[01:52]**  
So, um, if any point the deal is lost, then it should go into an automation of nurturing, like, you know, um, just a few emails, uh, in the, in the future just to get them back.

---

## No-Show Handling

And, uh, also if there's a call no show, then you want to automate, uh, some tasks to call them physically on the phone and also to send them some texts and emails. So that's kind of the general idea. I hope this makes sense. Um, let me know if you have any questions.
