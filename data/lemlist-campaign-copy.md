## EMAIL 1 — Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** MVA cases for {{companyName}}

Hey {{firstName}},

Quick question — is {{companyName}} currently taking on MVA cases?

We're a lead gen firm that delivers exclusive, pre-qualified motor vehicle accident cases to PI attorneys across the US. Live transfers and signed retainers.

We guarantee 15 cases minimum for new partners.

Worth a quick call this week?

## LINKEDIN INVITE — Day 3

Hi {{firstName}}, we help PI firms like {{companyName}} fill their pipeline with exclusive MVA cases. Would love to connect.

## EMAIL 2 — Day 5: Follow-up + Value

**Subject:** Re: MVA cases for {{companyName}}

{{firstName}},

Just following up — I know your inbox is probably slammed.

Here's the quick version of what we do:

→ We generate exclusive MVA leads (not shared with other firms)
→ Live transfers directly to your intake team
→ 15-case minimum guarantee for new partners
→ You only pay for cases that meet your criteria

We work with PI firms across the US who are looking to scale without adding overhead to their marketing.

If you're open to it, I'd love to do a quick 15-min call to see if we're a fit.

## LINKEDIN DM — Day 7 (if accepted invite)

Hey {{firstName}} — thanks for connecting! 

Quick question: is {{companyName}} buying MVA cases right now? We've been delivering 100+ exclusive cases/month for PI firms and just opened up capacity for new partners.

Happy to jump on a quick call if you're interested.

## EMAIL 3 — Day 9: Social Proof

**Subject:** How PI firms are getting 100+ MVA cases/month

{{firstName}},

I'll keep this brief.

We recently helped a mid-size PI firm go from struggling to find quality MVA leads to receiving 100+ verified cases per month — with a cost per case well below what they were paying for shared leads.

The difference? Exclusive leads, live transfers, and a guarantee.

If {{companyName}} is looking to grow its MVA caseload, we should talk.

## EMAIL 4 — Day 12: Breakup

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

{{firstName}},

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back, so I don't want to keep clogging your inbox.

If MVA cases aren't a priority for {{companyName}} right now, totally understand. I'll close out your file on our end.

But if the timing just wasn't right and you'd like to revisit later, just reply "later" and I'll follow up in a few months.

Either way — no hard feelings.
