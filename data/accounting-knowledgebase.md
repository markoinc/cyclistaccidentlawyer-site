## 3. PROFIT FIRST FRAMEWORK

### Core Concept
Revenue - Profit = Expenses (NOT Revenue - Expenses = Profit)

### Target Allocation Percentages (TAPs) by Revenue Range

| Revenue Range | Profit | Owner's Comp | Tax | OpEx |
|--------------|--------|-------------|-----|------|
| $0-$250K | 5% | 50% | 15% | 30% |
| $250K-$500K | 10% | 35% | 15% | 40% |
| $500K-$1M | 15% | 20% | 15% | 50% |

### KuriosBrand Current Allocation (Based on ~$80K/yr revenue)
- **Target:** 5% Profit / 50% Owner's Comp / 15% Tax / 30% OpEx
- **Actual (Jan 2026):** ~0% Profit / ?? Owner's Comp / ?? Tax / 66% OpEx (ad-heavy)

### How It Works
1. Every deposit → allocate percentages to separate accounts
2. Profit account: NEVER touch (take quarterly distributions)
3. Tax account: Build up for quarterly estimated payments
4. OpEx: ALL business expenses come from here
5. Owner's Comp: Your salary/draws

### Bank Account Structure (Recommended)
1. **Income** — All revenue deposits here first
2. **Profit** — 5% allocation (savings account)
3. **Owner's Comp** — 50% allocation
4. **Tax** — 15% allocation (Wells Fargo Tax account exists!)
5. **OpEx** — 30% allocation (this is the business checking)

## 5. BUSINESS vs PERSONAL EXPENSE RULES

### IRS Rule: "Ordinary and Necessary"
An expense must be:
1. **Ordinary** — Common and accepted in your trade/business
2. **Necessary** — Helpful and appropriate (not required to be indispensable)

### Common Gray Areas for KuriosBrand

| Expense | Business? | Rule |
|---------|-----------|------|
| T-Mobile phone | Partial | Deduct business % (e.g., 70%) |
| Internet | Partial | Deduct business % |
| Flights (Peru, Israel) | Depends | Business if primarily for business; personal days ok if trip is mainly business |
| Meta Ads on personal CC | Yes | Still business expense — just paid from wrong card |
| Spotify | Depends | Business if used for content creation; personal otherwise |
| Apple subscriptions | Depends | iCloud for business files = yes; Apple Music = no |
| Robinhood transfers | No | Personal investment, not business expense |
| ATM withdrawals abroad | Depends | Business if for business expenses; track what cash was used for |
| Student loans | No | Personal debt |
| Affirm payments | Depends | If purchased business equipment = yes |
| Discover CC | Depends | Only business charges are deductible |
| SafetyWing | Yes | Travel health insurance for business travel |
| Wise transfers | Depends | Business if paying for business expenses abroad |

### Mixing Personal & Business (Owner's Draws)
- Single-member LLC: No legal requirement for separate accounts
- **BUT** mixing can "pierce the corporate veil" (reduce LLC protection)
- Personal expenses paid from business account = **Owner's Draw** (not expense)
- Owner's draws are NOT tax deductible
- Best practice: Transfer money to personal account FIRST, then spend

## 6. CASH BASIS ACCOUNTING RULES

### When to Record Revenue
- **Cash basis:** When money hits your bank account
- Stripe deposits: Record on the day the payout lands in Chase 4991
- Zelle: Record on the day received
- NOT when the invoice is sent or work is done

### When to Record Expenses
- **Cash basis:** When money leaves your bank account
- CC charges: Record when the charge posts (NOT when you pay the CC bill)
- **CC payments are NOT expenses** — they're debt repayment
- Subscriptions: Record each monthly charge as it posts

### Stripe Revenue (Cash Basis)
- Gross charges ≠ Revenue (some fail, some get refunded)
- **Revenue = Net amount deposited to bank** (after fees, refunds, chargebacks)
- Stripe fees: Separate expense (Line 10 or Line 27a)
- Stripe Capital repayments: Principal = not deductible; Fee portion = deductible interest

### Credit Card Accounting
- CC charge = Expense (record when charge posts)
- CC payment from checking = NOT an expense (it's paying down debt)
- CC interest = Deductible if business card (Line 16b)
- **Double-counting risk:** Don't count both the CC charge AND the checking payment
