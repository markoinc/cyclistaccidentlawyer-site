--- PART 1 (minutes 0-20) ---

Hello, this is Max. Hey, Max. Hey. Mark, let me get Mr. Scott in here. Okay. Don't remember what state he's in. I got to check, but... Hey, I've got my partner, Max, with Cases on Demand, on the call now. Hi. Hey. How you doing there? Good. Good. How are you? It's... I'm sorry. It's Mark. I mean, it's Scott. Scott. Correct. Nice to meet you, Scott. Are we getting Jeremy, or we're good? Oh, Jeremy? No, I think we're good with the three of us. Okay, Scott, how you doing? He's in Vegas, by the way. I'm good. Yeah, I know he's in Vegas. Okay, so this is the second conversation that we've had. Yeah, Mark, where should we start? Okay, so we talked about a lot of things on the last call. You talked about how you tried a lot of stuff with zero RY. You tried small pronation, and we sent you a follow-up email. Let me check exactly what I had. I'm sorry. We had a lot of calls this week. Do you remember where we left off? Can you hold on one second? I need to let this contractor in. I'm sorry. Hold on one second. All right. Sorry, Scott. I'm looking at our email right now. Yeah, I think where we left off was that I wanted to hear from, you know, someone from Cases on Demand, because my recollection was no one was on the phone from Cases on Demand. Correct. Yeah, that's pretty much where we were at. It's just, you know, we explained what we could, but we had double booked, so Max wasn't on the call. So now he's here. When he's back, I'll just let him know. Sure. All right, I'm back. Okay, so, Scott, we're talking about Vegas, okay? And I had heard that you had ran a lot of media, did a lot of opt-in lead gen with other agencies and didn't have luck. I think we talked about, you know, potentially giving you transfers. Well, how do you feel your own intake is? I know the assumption is that all the leads suck, okay? But in general, like, you know, are you doing well with anyone's opt-ins or no one's opt-ins? No, none so far. Okay, so, and do you guys get live transfers from anyone? How do you get cases from digital right now? Predominantly, I would say referrals, and then from my own branding ads on social media. Gotcha, okay, so just like word of mouth, referrals, you're running your own ads. Yeah, I wouldn't say so much word of mouth like that. I mean, we do get some like that, but on a consistent basis, I don't know if you know the low firm in Utah. I work with them, yeah. Okay, so I could probably get some of your leads that way. They send me, you know, I mean, I don't know if they send me everything, but I think they send me everything in New Mexico. They send me some stuff in Arizona and Nevada. I think I've proven myself to them. So, you know, they just keep sending things to me. My understanding is a lot of their partners in various states are not nearly as good in communicating and jumping and things like that as I am. So I think they're happy. So I get a lot from them. I do have my own, you know, branding. There's a firm in Philadelphia, Palmahockey. I get a bunch of stuff from them, but, I mean, their stuff has not been. Okay. I lived in Jamison for like one summer while I was in law school. My parents got transferred. Jamison, is that in PA? In Dwellstown, yeah. Oh, Dwellstown, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm in Westchester. I'm in the suburbs. Yeah, I don't. My parents moved there while I was in law school, so I don't. And then they transferred back to New York, so I don't know the area very well. Gotcha. I'm not a Villanova fan, I can tell you that. I'm a diehard Tar Heel and was at the Villanova Carolina finals in 2016, so I really don't like Villanova. But, yeah, so they send me stuff. Their stuff is. Go ahead. I'm sorry. No, no, I'm sorry. I was just going to say. The Palmahockey firm. Yeah, the Palm. I get a lot of referrals. I'm a lawyer's lawyer. I'm not a figurehead kind of thing. I know exactly what you're talking about. Yep. So, yeah, I think a lot of. I get referrals because other firms know that I'm a real lawyer. And then I've been running some branded ads on social media recently. And so I would say that's the predominant. And then referrals from past clients. Yep. And you are licensed in Nevada and New Mexico? Correct. And Arizona and Florida. Oh, okay. Do you want to sign cases in all four of those states? No interest in Florida. Did that for a really, really long time before opening up the Vegas office. Florida, I don't think it's great just because, I mean, it's too far from where I am now. I used to live in Florida. And, you know, as you probably know, there's no B.I. requirement in Florida. A lot of drops. I work with anger, green, and fine. They're there. And they're happy if they're under, like, a 50% drop rate. Wait, say that again. Because I know, I mean, I don't know them. I know of them because they have billboards all up and down 95 in South Florida. So, wait, what happened? A 50% drop off. Yeah, so, they, because of, you know, yeah, because of insurance and no requirement to have insurance in Florida, essentially, you know, with their online flow, like, with their digital, you know, signups from social media, they're happy if they sign 10 and keep five. Okay. Yeah, anything less than a 50% drop rate of cases is, like, good for them. Because everyone's driving around with no insurance. Yeah, no, I know South Florida well. I mean, my wife and I sold, we closed on our house in Fort Lauderdale in September. So, I mean, I'm, what I'd be curious in terms of what you know about Steiger is how, in this day and age, and it's really got nothing to do with South Florida, but it would translate to Vegas, to everywhere. What are they seeing in terms of getting cases from TV and billboards now? I would imagine that they're having a significant drop off from that. You know, more and more people are just using their phones and social media and stuff like that. But I'm curious, I've never heard from, you know, I've never asked someone that advertises heavily on TV and billboards, what changes they're seeing. Yeah. Well, I mean, a lot of that that they do is also for branding, right? So when you're doing it all together and you have the branding, yeah, obviously they get cases, they still get cases because they have so many billboards all over the place. But I think where they get a lift is in the brand recognition once they then buy leads. Because if people, you know, see your name everywhere and then they fill out a form online and then you're the one that calls them, you know, it obviously, it positively impacts the call for sure, as opposed to someone that doesn't know, you know, doesn't know who you are. Sure. We don't really talk much about their, you know, their other media and the efficacy of it. We just focus on the lead gen. Lead gen, they've been with me for five years. They spend about $150,000 a month on Florida, Arizona, and Texas, those three. They're live in all three of those states. And then, yeah, we work with Lowe in, you know, in all whatever, 18 or 20 of the states that they're in. And New Mexico is a great state for us, even though we don't have like, I mean, obviously we're live with Lowe, but we don't have any, like, big name New Mexico firms. But there's this one solo guy that's been buying from me, you know, $15,000 a month for five years, and he's happy. He never complains. I don't hear a peep from him. So I think it's a solid state as far as case values go. You obviously have a lot of trucking going on there. Nevada is the one that's a real pain in the ass. You know, the conversion rate on the Nevada leads, it's low. You know, like, there's just a lot of people willing to fill out a form for an attorney in Nevada. And, you know, all kinds of crazy scenarios come up as far as, like, what these people have happened to them. So conversion rates close to 10% there, whereas in New Mexico would be like 15%. And that's another part of this is the intake. Okay. So, like, you know, Steiger, Lowe, okay, Lowe has, I don't know, 100 intake reps or something crazy. They're signing, you know, hundreds and hundreds. They might be up close to 1,000 cases a month right now. They're very big. You know, they run it like a machine. And, you know, when a lead comes in, their system is all set up so that that lead is getting dialed within minutes. You know, it's getting called multiple times a day, the first day. And then at least for a week after that, every single day, each lead is getting followed up with at least three times. Obviously, you talk to a lot of people in the first day or two when you're, you know, when you're following up. But, you know, a lot of people need some additional follow-up. They don't know it's you when you're calling. So, you know, they're looking at their phone. They don't know who it is. They're busy. They're this or that. They're at work. And who really wants to answer a call from someone they don't know? So it takes a little bit of persistence, sometimes, you know, some texting, some text sequences. And I think that's where, like, if we plug that piece for you, I think that our marketing will be great. I mean, because, I mean, the leads work if you work them. Now, in regard to... Go ahead. Let me just stop you, Max, for a second, because here's my experience. Okay? Yeah. So intake currently is not the problem at all. I handle all the intake. And, you know, if I can't do something or track someone down, an associate attorney, you know, will do it. Okay. That's not the problem. The problem that I'm having is I would love to have a situation where I'm getting so overwhelmed, so many leads, that I can't do it. Okay. But that's not the problem. The problem is the leads are junk. And they're not, I mean, they're worthless. So, for example, and I do have a lot of experience with this, even dealing with the low cases, because I get signed retainers. You know, I mean, they, as you know, their system, they sign the cases and then they send them out. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, I mean, it's crazy to me how society is now. They send me stuff and, you know, I would say that it's probably, I don't know, you know, 50%, maybe even 60%. You can't even reach these people after they sign a retainer. And, you know, I don't give up. I mean, there was a case that I, in August, and I didn't, I never reached the, was able to actually reach the client until I think December. And now I have a $70,000 offer on it. You know, so I'm persistent. The problem, as I'm saying, is it's shit. Like, so, so, so that's, that's one thing. That's signed, actually signed cases. And then I've, I've run into a couple situations where Lowe's signed. I've got a retainer, but the person has also signed a retainer with another firm because we're just bouncing around. They have no clue what they're even doing. So that's one scenario because that, that just is interesting because it's actually signed retainers that then I have to track these people down. My situation, what I'm seeing from Law Pro Nation, from Louder Media, from some other companies that I've worked with is, you know, the leads, I mean, they suck. There's nothing. I blew through almost 50 grand in a month with top prone, with Law Pro Nation. And I forgot the guy's name that is the owner, but, you know, he, when I was like 43,000 spend, I think I'd gotten like maybe five cases from it, six cases. And he, you know, I was done. And, and, you know, he was like, yeah, no, I'm really sorry. He's apologizing to me. This usually works. You know, I don't know why it's not working. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You know, he just returned the 7,000 that was left. Yeah, no, that was, that was Law Pro Nation. Louder, so Louder, I was with them for three months. And similar to what you're talking about, like they use, you know, Robert Valente or whatever at HQ. Do you know what I'm talking about? Like they're, that's their intake company. Yes. Say that one more time. Cause you, you, you. Okay. So Louder. They use who? No. Louder uses a, Louder uses a company in California that a lot of people I've seen to know HQ. It's owned by some guy named Robert Valente. Yeah. Yeah. I have no, no problem. I had no problem with, with Robert's team. I think they're really good at tracking down people and, and selling and all that. But there wasn't anything to sell. It was, it was just, you know, every day I'm getting reports of, you know, rejection, rejection, rejection, rejection at a very high cost. When you throw in the intake company on top of, yeah. When, when I'm not getting anything, I mean, it, it, it adds a significant amount. And then I'm still using him with, do you know Forrest Zuckerman? Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think like leads or something like that. Yeah. Okay. I spent, I spent, yeah, legal leads. So I spent 23,000, I want to say like in October and they're close to running out of the 23,000. I mean, that's how slow it's been. And even just using the spend, it's taken months to spend 23,000. And I think I've gotten two cases from it. I mean, it's, it's like, you know, that's my experience. Yeah. Are they in Nevada? Are they running in Nevada for you? They've been running in Nevada, Nevada. And then, and then when they were, you know, not having luck or whatever, then they added New Mexico. And, you know, Forrest was telling me that, you know, he thought that that would be more fertile. I haven't gotten, I've not gotten one single thing from New Mexico from leads. Now they, they have a weird, you know, I don't know if you know what they do. Theirs is basically, yeah, exactly. Which sucks. Like, you know, I thought that it might, I thought it sounded good. And I talked to a lawyer. It can be good. It can be good. But I mean. I talked to a lawyer. I talked to a police report. Yeah. I talked to a lawyer in Florida who, you know, before I signed on and, you know, he was doing great in Florida from it. So it's like every time it seems like, you know, I try to do due diligence. I talked to, you know, some firms and stuff like that, references. And I end up just getting, I'm just burning money left and right like that. That's, that's what's been my situation. At this point in time, I'm not interested in just leads because leads suck. Like, I'm interested in actual cases. Yep. Well, because. First off, I do think that for me, I would actually not start us with Nevada. I would say Arizona, New Mexico, I feel very good about. I mean, I am reengaging this firm this week, Richard Harris. But I mean, I even worked with them a year ago in Nevada and they're like, you know, supposed to be the best. And, you know, they were at like four or four or five grand a case. Like, it's just a really difficult state. It is. I know. I know. Obviously. Wait, hold on. Let me let me know about because I know. I mean, I don't.


--- PART 2 (minutes 20-40) ---

I know Richard, I don't know Richard Harris. I know Richard Harris, the firm very, very well. Just so you know, from about 2010 to about 2019, we were consistently one of the top five TV ad spenders in Vegas. Richard Harris is one of them. We were usually like third. So I'm used to spending a lot of money on TV and I saw where that was going and got out. But Richard Harris, yeah, I know well. So if it's not working for Richard Harris, it's not gonna work for me properly in Vegas. Most likely. Vegas seems to be, every campaign I've ever run in Vegas, I mean, yeah, clients will sign some cases, but like at a four or five grand cost per case, because there's just, the leads are crazy. Like, you know, people that. What is it about Vegas? This is what I don't understand, because every market in this day and age is competitive. I mean, you know, every single market, like I said, I come from South Florida. Every market is competitive, but it just seems like there's something different going on in Vegas. Yeah, I don't even know that Vegas is, yeah, of course it's competitive, just like any place, but I don't think it's any extra competitive. I just think that, you know, look, at the end of the day, like as a marketing agency, we do a media buy. We're putting ads in front of eyeballs, right? And the algorithm is largely responsible for who sees the ads. Like, you know, I mean, there's no targeting for a motor vehicle accident case. The targeting is the fact that we've ran $40 million through ad accounts and they know now what a lead is and what's, you know, they know what the target. But in Vegas, it feels like the actual people that fill out the forms are like just a crazy mix. I mean, you've got people that are like, oh, I got shot or like my car got shot or, you know, just all kinds of crazy, wild things. Something happened three years ago, can you help me? Like, I've never seen a market where people are so willing to fill out a form when they do not have a case even close. It's just crazy. I don't know if it's like the gambling, you know, mentality of Vegas. Like, is it like, oh, let me see if I can get some free money. You know, I don't know. Right. But New Mexico and Arizona, I love. But now that you're saying this and I've tried Vegas a handful of times and you've tried Vegas with all my competitors and nobody has been able to do it, including myself, I would just say, let's just scrap Vegas. I'm sorry. And let's just do a couple of good states, New Mexico and Arizona. And I like, I mean, Robert works with a lot of my clients. I work with a lot of his clients. He refers, you know, clients to me when they want more leads. So like, I like him as far as their intake goes. I think he's solid. There is also another intake agency that I have been referring a little more than Robert only because they're a decent size now, HQ Intake. And, you know, I just, sometimes I like a smaller team. I feel like the client gets a little bit more, you know, TLC. So if you were wanting to test out anyone, meet new people, inquire to Esquire. Actually, you met Patrick. Yeah, Patrick on the last call. So Patrick is who I, Patrick and HQ are both equally great. I'll be honest, Patrick is a little bit cheaper. I mean, Patrick charges $350 a case for a sign up and all in HQ probably comes out to about 500 once you factor in their per minute fees and things like that. Right. But either way, you know, they're both good. I just would stay away from Nevada. And I think that's probably your main problem after hearing everything you've experienced and plus everything I've experienced in the state, which is not a good state. It's the only state in the whole country that I've experienced this with. It's just a weird thing. Yeah, that's crazy. So my only concern with, you know, I'm learning New Mexico. When I say learning, you know, there's the problem with New Mexico logistically for me right now. And it's not something that, you know, I'm steering away from because of, but it's just, it's more difficult than Las Vegas. Las Vegas, I have a whole network of doctors, like, yeah. And I have a physical office there, which more and more, that's not really important, but it's the doctors that is a big, you know, I don't, you know, everything, every time like I get something from low, it's like, we gotta go find a chiropractor that takes lean, that's close to the client, you know, and then forget about, you know, MRIs and pain management and orthos and all. Everything is like a research project, basically. And then because I don't have the volume there, I've never had the volume there like I have in Las Vegas. So just, you know, there's always a concern of, I don't know these chiros, and if it's a one and done type of case, you know, what are they gonna do at the end of the case with reductions and all that stuff? I'm open to New Mexico. I, you know, I think that it's probably a fertile ground and a place that I would like to eventually have a physical presence in with an office. So I'm open to that. I'm just telling you that, you know, from an ideal standpoint, it's not ideal compared to Las Vegas, but Las Vegas seems to suck. So. What about your network in Arizona? I don't have, Arizona is less than New Mexico. I get, I don't get a lot of stuff from Arizona. You know, I get stuff, but I don't have, it's the same situation. Like if I have to find someone, you know, if I get someone in Phoenix or something like that, I find that it's probably easier to deal with the people in New Mexico than Arizona, because Phoenix is such a, you know, they have Lerner and Rose in Mexico as well, but it's not the same as in, you know, Phoenix is such a big city that it's harder, I think, for someone that doesn't have a physical office right there to operate in Phoenix. You know, Northern Arizona, close to Vegas, you know, that's a little bit different, but then you're in a more rural area. So I've had some cases there where it's like, who are we gonna get to treat? Where's the closest chiropractor to some of these people? So I think New Mexico is probably better than Arizona. I agree, because if we do, I was just gonna say, if we do both, then, I mean, I think if you're gonna do one, you just pick one so you can build your medical network, right? Like- Exactly, I totally agree. So like, are the ads that you run, are they branded like with me or like, how are the- No, so I'll explain how we do it. So we do a media by style campaign. So it's a one-to-one dedicated campaign for you. So it's not a shared funnel or anything, but the ads are unbranded. So we run everything in our ecosystem, in our ad accounts, using our landing pages, our ads and everything. And they're just, you know, the pages that we run them on are just generically sounding, you know, personal injury pages. These ads are typically video style ads that have a spokesperson and it's just straight up like direct response marketing type of script, you know. It's speaking to the audience, you know, if you've been seriously injured in a car accident in New Mexico and you're missing work and you've had seriously serious injuries, you may be entitled to compensation. You know, it's important to seek, you know, advice from an attorney, blah, blah, blah. And then the call to action is just, you know, click to pre-qualify for a case evaluation and get contacted by a highly rated attorney in your state or some general, you know, just like that. What we don't do is we don't promise any timeframes or any turnaround times, any amounts of money. We don't have any ads that use like fake clients where we pretend it's a real client like getting money or waiving checks or anything like that. Really the secret sauce is just, it's just in the ad account. You're essentially in media by style. You're essentially renting our ad account that's run $40 million worth of marketing through it. Everything is nice and seasoned. So when we run a new campaign for you, everything starts, you know, not from zero, you know, it starts from a good place. The leads convert, you know, right out of the gate and so forth. So in New Mexico- I do have a question. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. No, no, finish your thought and then I'll ask you the question. Yeah, I was just gonna say that the last thing is in New Mexico, the leads are gonna be somewhere around like the 250 to 300 per lead mark. These are one year filtered leads, okay? So we found that the leads that are between one and two years, there are cases there, we know this, because if we don't send them to the client, we send them to Walker Advertising and they do monetize them and pay us for them. The amount of cases and the percentage of cases in those one to two year leads is very, very small. That it really becomes better just to send a fresh lead within one year. Everything you sign is gonna be everything within 30 days still, you know, within 30 days, 60 days tops. I don't anticipate you're gonna sign a lot of deals, a lot of cases that are, you know, almost a year from the accident, but they happen, you know, big injuries and big treatment in the beginning and they just haven't, you know, it just happened to not get an attorney. Sure. Yeah. So like, what is the difference? Why is it better to go through like you all or some other company versus me running my own branded ads? Like. Yeah, that's a good question. Legal and direct to meta, like I do in Nevada. What is it that makes it better to go through you all? Yeah, yeah, for sure. So when it comes to media buying and generating like quality leads on YouTube or meta or anywhere, like I said before, there's no special sauce as far as like, oh, I can figure out the right targeting to find the best cases. Like that doesn't exist because a motor vehicle accident is a motor vehicle accident. So really the only thing that makes, you know, one campaign better than another is the data, the data that it's already generated. And when in an ad account, you've spent millions of dollars on the same type of lead over and over and over again across the country and in all the states, the pixel learns, like the algorithm is like this AI, you know, smart AI algorithm that has all the data from every dollar you've ever spent. And it basically goes out and finds the people that are gonna become a lead that it thinks are gonna become a lead based on everyone's behaviors online. When you run a campaign with very little data, yes, you can get leads, you can sign cases, okay? But scalability is an issue. You might have a specific campaign like producing leads at a certain cost per lead. And then it just takes a shit, right? It just, it pops up and it's like a lot more per lead or just stops working all together. Like that's a very common thing when, you know, you haven't basically spent anything. So that's what I mean when I say like, you're basically renting an ad account that has all this MVA data and experience and history in it, over 250,000 leads generated to date. So when we start and we go live, like the leads are converting from the beginning. You know, you'll be closing the same percentage of leads in your first hundred leads as your third hundred leads. You know what I mean? Like it starts from the beginning doing what you expected to do. Whereas brand new campaigns are unpredictable. You don't really know what their costs or quality is gonna be, you know? Yeah, and as far as the branding goes, I mean, you know, this type of business, I'm not telling you anything you don't know, like, you know, unless they already really know you, it doesn't matter. You know, like the branding in our business is such that only the firms that, you know, have ample branding already get any benefit from running ads with their branding. If there's not a lot of branding and people don't know you, you know, one law firm is no different from another. They're just looking for who's gonna help them. Mainly it's what happens on the phone is how they feel about you personally, like you as a lawyer, you and their conversation. It's less about your name and your branding and more about just, do they trust you? Do they think that you can help them with their case? And if they do, they'll sign. Got it. Okay, so tell me what is the structure in terms of, like I said, I'm not interested in just leads. I want cases. So what- Yeah, you want cases. So yeah, so here's how we do it. So like cases on demand as an agency, we just do the one thing that we're good at. So no matter how the client, what end product the client gets, we take care of the leads. Okay, so we do the marketing. We don't sell cases internally ourselves, but we partner with HQ Intake is one of them and Inquire to Esquire to have our clients get either signups or a qualified transfer. And then we basically put those two pieces together and between the marketing and the qualified transfers or the signups, you end up with a good case cost, profitable cost for a new case, all wrapped up and delivered to you. The two options, I mean, I don't know if we should, I'll just give them to you. The two options are qualified transfers with our leads or a full signup. Do you have a, I mean, the qualified transfers convert at 50%. You would get the transfer during your hours and you would need to talk to them the rest of the way and sign them. Alternatively, a full signup is a full signup. Do you have any preference either way? I mean, a full signup would still be to your criteria, just like Robert at HQ signs only things that the criteria that you guys are on the same page about. So either way, it's your criteria, but do you have an affinity for, do you really wanna have spoken to them and do the signup yourself? Are you okay if someone else does that, the whole thing? I mean, I'm open to both. I mean, one of the things I would, I need to look at New Mexico, for example. Their bar rules. Nevada's rules are so strict, in general. I mean, we've been working around them, but I really like to do everything 100% by the book. And Nevada requires a lawyer involved in the intake. And so kind of with HQ, I mean, there just haven't been enough of them, so it hasn't really mattered. But I think HQ would sign, get a retainer signed, but tell the person on the phone that they need to talk to finalize everything. Yeah, they need to speak to me or something like that to kind of comply. Go ahead. No, no, go ahead. Whereas you were gonna say, whereas. Whereas in Florida, I'm really, I know Florida very well. And when we were really operating heavily in Florida, it was like, there's no requirement like that. So call comes in, intake person just calls one of our investigators. The investigator takes care of it. And there's no lawyer involved, but like in Vegas. And I have no idea what New Mexico is like. Yep, so I'll tell you how, I mean, HQ, they do it that way. Inquired Esquire, Patrick, he does it the same way. And he's added an additional step where when he signs them, he will do a transfer and introduce them to you live. And then you can continue the conversation or you could book a call or whatever you wanna do. But he attempts to transfer after signing to kind of hand them over. Obviously, he's reaching out to them on behalf of your law firm, like with the name. But then it feels to the client, like they go from intake to case management. You know what I mean? And I kinda like that, yeah. No, I like that a lot. And what happens if there is, if no one's available, for example, what should they do? Yes, if no one's available, they still were signed up and he basically tells them, hey, all of our case managers or whatever you wanted to say are unavailable. They're gonna call you back within hours today and talk to you and review your case and finalize your case. He never says anything like you have a case or any of that language. It's always just like, this is just the next step in the process. If they ask him, do you think I have a case? He may say like, based on my experience, similar situations have been a case, but everything is pending final review. I'm gonna get you over to a case manager or to an attorney that's gonna look at your file and they can decide, blah, blah, blah.


--- PART 3 (minutes 40-60) ---

So, yes, similar kind of thing, never promising them that it is a case. And they do call, you know, they do call on behalf of your firm, so it feels like everything is kind of all internal. And then on the qualified transfer side, I'll just tell you how his pricing works. So, if he's doing a sign-up, it's $350 a sign-up, okay, and he signs them up fully on all your paperwork and then does that transfer. If he's doing a qualified transfer, they're going to call our leads, work the leads, get them on the phone, and then they're going to check for a few things. So, first, treatment within the first 21 days, 30 days tops, okay? Make sure there's clear liability, they weren't at fault, you know, ask about police reports and things. There's clear insurance to go after the person wasn't already represented, or if the law firm accepts, you know, swapping people out, then obviously that's a different story, but that's kind of an optional decision for you to make, whether you want people with, you know, that are already represented or not. And then he'll transfer them over to you. The only thing you really are, you know, needing to check on are specifics, you know, regarding injury, ongoing treatment, making sure there's no gaps in treatment. And about 50% of the transfers turn into a signed case. So, he does a really good job of cleaning up the leads, getting, you know, clearing out the junk leads, and, you know, finding the people that are actually injured, they're at least in that first month, and getting them over to you. So, those are $100 per transfer, so, you know, you're basically paying the same, you know, for a transfer, or like, you're paying the same per case, no matter what you do. If it's, if it's exactly 50%, I guess you're saving a little bit. If you just do transfers, it'll cost you a couple hundred dollars versus $350, but, you know, obviously, conversion rates are fluid. It could be 40%, you know, this month, and 55% the next month. But he's made it so that they're largely comparable programs. It's really just a personal preference on whether you really like to speak to the clients and sign them, or whether you're okay with someone else just, you know, vetting it to your criteria, and signing them up, and getting them over to you. Got it. Okay, so, so, and then what is, what is your call? I mean, what are your charges? Yep, yep. So, so then, we run a media buy style campaign. So, essentially, we pick a budget together, we're spending basically that whole budget in the platform on ads, and getting you, you know, that roughly $250 to $300 lead cost that I talked about. That's all inclusive of our management fees. It's just baked in there. And as far as, like, minimums go, you know, I mean, I recommend $20,000 or $30,000, but I would say a hard minimum is $15,000. You know, $15,000 is like the lowest amount of budget to make sure you get enough leads so that whoever is signing them, you know, has enough to work with and can find the cases. You know, $20,000, $25,000, obviously $30,000, we're talking about now, like, close to 100 leads or maybe a little bit more than 100 leads. It's a really, really great sample size. Like, you're, you're almost, as much as guaranteeing yourself, you know, success, because even if you, you know, so let's say you sign out of 100 cases, you sign 12, you know, 12%. That's also enough cases that you probably have one or two commercial policies in there, because about 15% of our leads are commercial policy. You know, so when you get that many cases and one or two commercial policies, like, the whole campaign really gets, you know, it really gets juicy. You know, it gets good from an optics standpoint. But $15,000, you know, that comes out to, what, somewhere around 50 leads. So, at 300 a lead, 50, at 250, we'll call it 50 to 60 leads. Yeah, you know, he should sign seven, but it's only 50 leads. Like, he could sign five, right? So, if you do 15, you know, just keep that in mind when you look at the results, right? If we ended up signing, you know, five, which is 10%, or even four, because it's only a couple less than six and only one less than five, like, we're splicing individual small numbers here. You know, I would say if we did 15 grand and we signed even four, like, you should give it another go, because it's just kind of a small sample size of leads. But so, if we're talking New Mexico and I'm spending $30,000, about, like, how many cases? Yeah, so you're about, like, well, I mean, in New Mexico, the client that's live there is signing cases for around two grand a case-ish. So, 30 grand should get you somewhere around 15 cases. It might be, you know, 13. And then on top of that, like, let's say that I was doing the $350,000 model, then I pay Patrick. Yes, you'll pay him directly. No, only for the ones that end up signing. So, you're only paying him the $350,000 for, like, okay, so let's say, oh, yes, if you signed if you gave me 30 grand, yes, correct, you'd pay $350,000 for each of the sign-ups. Got it, okay. Yeah. So, all in between the leads and the sign-ups, you know, I'd put you somewhere around the $2,500 to $3,000 mark as far as a case cost goes. And I mean, for that to be all in, including the labor of the sign-up and the intake, you know, it's pretty good. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'm trying to think. And what is, from, what's the time period, the startup time period? Quick. So, I mean, after we get agreement, invoice, and I mean, that's really it, agreement and invoice, we would liaise directly with Patrick or HQ. We have internal Slack channels with both of them. We would set up the campaign within two days and, yeah, be live by day three. Okay, all right. And what is your experience, if any, regarding either slip and falls or dog bites? Hmm. So, the last time we ran any sort of general PI was actually when we just started five years ago in 2020. We had campaigns that were like general PI that included MVA and also slip and falls and dog bites. You know, because we were very green and young, you know, I can't necessarily say that, you know, what we experienced is, you know, what we'd experienced today. But in general, those types of leaves are, yeah, there's too, there's so many variables to what makes a good dog bite case and what makes a slip and fall an actual case. So, what we found then was that the conversion rate is less on those and just not really worth doing marketing for just because there's just a wide range of, you know, of situations that can happen and people that, you know, think they have a case or, you know, whatever and they don't or that sort of thing. So, generally, we just focus on our lanes, which is MVA, you know, brings in the money, it's got the cash flow, you know, converts consistently and, you know, we just focus there. I mean, but we do, we have a whole creative team. We do DUI ads for some people. We do family law ads for other people. Like, we can do general PI and slip and falls and dog bites if that's something you're super interested in. I just couldn't tell you, like, oh, yeah, like, this is the lead cost. I mean, the lead cost is going to be about the same, but I couldn't tell you, like, this is the case cost you definitely should expect. Yeah. No, the only reason I was asking is because I've noticed that Lowe has clearly made a strategic change to, at least in New Mexico, it seems like they're gunning much more dog bites than MVA. Yeah. And that's what I'm saying. I get a lot of insight because of what I, you know, so I think that it depends, I guess, on how the ads are and everything. I think what I'm seeing is a lot. So the problem with auto, as you know, is, you know, a lot of these people that are filling out forms, it's been over 30 days. They, you know, what I would see Lowe getting is these older auto cases with no treatment or only going to an urgent care center six months ago. You know, they're coming out of the woodwork because of the ads that are basically enticing them to fill out the form that they think they're going to get money or something like that. These people from experience, you know, with autos with them, then I'm calling the person. They have no police slip. They have no information on the person, you know, that was at fault for the accident. So many of them go nowhere because they either lack of treatment, have no clue, you know, who the at fault person was, have no information. You know, it's just, it's like a shit show, basically. Whereas dog bite stuff, at least from Lowe, what I'm finding is, for example, I just got one where the dog bite actually occurred in 2019, but it was to a five year old. So there's no statute of limitations issue. And the kid was bitten in his balls by a pit bull and had to be airlifted to a hospital in Tucson, Arizona, from New Mexico. So dog bites, like, you know, I keep getting stuff from Lowe where the dog bite might have occurred six months ago, eight months ago, whatever. You know, I settled one for 500 grand because there's the treatment is not like, again, and going back to what I was saying, you don't need a network of doctors. You know, they've had their treatment or they, whatever. So I just like, it's just been interesting because I used to think dog bites sucked. Like, and, you know, the issue ultimately is, is the person a homeowner that has homeowners insurance and all that kind of stuff. Like, you know, how much can you make on like that dog bite with the kid? Like, what's your, like, my clients say their average attorney's fees for MVA are 10 to 15 grand. So like, that's really good. Because I would say that for MVA, it's, it's less than that. I would say it's eight, eight to 10. Yeah. Well, also remember that. Yeah. I was going to, I wanted to comment on the Lowe thing. You know, Lowe is, you know, the model that they run, right? So like they're anything that even has legs, they want to sign up and see. Oh, yeah. Trust me. Yeah. Trust me. I know that because I'm the one that's running around. Because you're the one that's doing it, right? Yeah. Yeah. No, I fully understand their model. Yeah. But what would you make on dog bites? Well, like, I mean, it just depends. I mean, it depends on, like, any case, it depends on how bad what the medicals are and stuff like that. But in general, adjusters, because they're basing things off of what juries do, people are people really are sympathetic to dog bites. So the psychological component, so like the 500k one, and that wasn't a low one that was that was one of mine in Arizona. Um, like, she had very limited treatment, but it was a pit bull. And, and there were some aggravating circumstances that the, the pit bull was wearing a stupid placard, you know, an asshole owner with a has his dog with a wearing like a placard with a sign that says, you know, don't fuck with me or something stupid. I can't remember exactly what it was, but it was out. It was outrageous. And she, you know, she was good on the arm. And she got a good result. I mean, she, she had very, very limited treatment. The meds are like, you know, I think less than 20k, but they're they were afraid of that one. And I just find that a that some dog bite cases are better than, you know, someone that is in a fender bender with not much property damage and they go to a Cairo or something like that. And, and, you know, it's, it's just a, a whippy type case. So I think some dog bites are better than that. Like I said, the issue is, and there's, there's, you know, if there's homeowners insurance, the limits are way higher than state minimum limits. So same thing with slip and fall. I mean, that's why slip and falls are by and large, you get, they're harder. You got to litigate them usually. But like, if you've got a slip and fall at Walmart, the sky's the limit. I mean, you know, whatever the value of the cases, they can pay it. Whereas, whereas you can get an auto case with horrible injuries, but there's 25k policy and that's all you're going to get. So I was just curious because I've definitely seen a difference in Lowe's focus, at least what they're sending me is, is in the last two months, it's been way more dog bite cases than slipping, than MVAs. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't be, I mean, I'm kind of interested to see what it would do. I wouldn't be opposed to, or think it would be a bad idea to maybe take a portion of, you know, your MBA budget and just do a little, you know, five grand, you know, dog bite campaign, just to see what the lead costs are, to see what kind of conversations you have. And I assume if we did dog bites, maybe Nevada would come back into play. If the ad is specifically about dog bites and doesn't get all that junk traffic from the MBA stuff. It's just a thought. I mean, you know, cause you're willing, cause he, the reason why nobody else also does dog bites is because nobody wants to try cases. Nobody wants to go to court. So like you're in a different boat, like you'll, you'll go to court, you know, you'll. Yeah. And, and to be honest, I don't think, I don't think dog bite cases, Muslim go to court. I, like I said, I think that there's a serious fear factor, psychological component and all slip and falls completely different. I mean, slips and falls are litigated, but so far, you know, I'm just seeing the, like I said, the biggest difference is if a dog bite occurred six months ago and they went to the emergency room and they got stitched up and they have a scar or something like that. And they're, they're just now calling a lawyer. They don't need any more treatment. They already got whatever it's done. It's in the can. It's like you go right to, you get the stuff and you just pray that there's insurance and you send a demand letter and start negotiating versus someone that calls from an auto accident six months ago. And all they did was go to an urgent care center. You can't send them, you know, out for any more treatment. The case is worth, you know, an ER visit cost plus, you know, a little for inconvenience or something like that. That's just what I've seen. You know, I'm just, I just, like I said, because I get so much volume from, from seeing what Lowe is doing, like it's just, that's why I just threw it, threw it out and asked the question. I think for me initially, what I would want to do is probably go the traditional route with the MBAs and, and then, and then scale and, and then out in other things and, you know, try out dog bikes in, in Nevada or something like that. But like, yeah, I think, I think my thing would be initially to, to go the traditional route. So, so let me, let me think, think, think of, I've got a zoom call with a client. Yeah, yeah. All good. Me too. Yeah. Think about it. We'll, we'll, we'll send you an email, but yeah, I mean, when would make sense to chat again? Do you want to talk this week, next week, whatever? I mean, if I have any questions, it might be just, it's either a go or it's not a go kind of thing. I don't know that I'll have, I do have one other question because, because I, you guys know Matt Kerto, right? Like Kerto or Kerto from Sanguine. Oh yes, I know. Yes. I know Kevin from Sanguine the owner. Yeah. Okay. So, so Matt told me that I think they might've worked with you guys in the past and, and then, and then now, like he was kind of like very in a positive, spoke positively. I think he might've even talked to you guys yesterday or something. I just talked to him. I just talked to them yesterday. He said that, he said that the model changed for the better or something like that. So I'm curious, what was the model before? Yep. The model before was a pay per lead where it was a fixed price per lead and we had a standard filters, but like, for example, the leads were all within two years. So what happened was over the years, as this space became more competitive, more older leads got into the mix and just, yeah, the quality overall of our leads decreased over time. And then, so yeah, like a lot of the early people that they referred to us by 2024, they, you know, they weren't getting good results, but that's why we switched to this direct media buy model. We filter it now to one year and, you know, we can even, you know, go even lower than that. Just gives us more flexibility with the client and it's a dedicated campaign. So got it. Got it. Totally understood. Okay, great. I will be in touch. I really appreciate it. It was a good call. It was informative. I got to hop on this other Zoom and I will be in touch with you guys either, you know, today or tomorrow. Okay. All right. Thanks, Scott. Nice to meet you. Talk to you soon. Likewise. Thank you. Bye.
