      "question": "How much does it cost?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What's the minimum?",
      "answer": "We have a minimum to make sure we can deliver meaningful results. The team can explain the options on a call."

    {
      "question": "How do I know the leads are real?",
      "answer": "Every lead is OTP-verified (they confirm via text code) and goes through TrustedForm/Jornaya compliance. Real people, real contact info."

    },
    {
      "question": "What's the conversion rate?",
      "answer": "Our live transfers see 40-60% sign rates because they're pre-qualified and warm transferred while still on the line."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast do you contact leads?",
      "answer": "Within 5 minutes of form submit. Then 18 touches over 9 days. We do all the follow-up so your team just handles warm transfers."

      "question": "What CRMs do you integrate with?",
