## ⚠️ CONSTRAINTS (The Hard Truth)

### What I CANNOT Do Autonomously:
1. **Close sales calls** — Business is B2B, requires human relationship
2. **Send external emails** — My rules prohibit without Marko approval
3. **Create/send invoices** — Stripe API is read-only
4. **Approve ad spend changes** — Need human authorization
5. **Negotiate deals** — Requires nuanced human judgment

### What I CAN Do:
1. ✅ Optimize existing Meta campaigns
2. ✅ Monitor lead quality and flow
3. ✅ Set up automated reminder systems
4. ✅ Surface opportunities for follow-up
5. ✅ Track and report progress
6. ✅ Deploy/maintain MVA sites
7. ✅ Analyze and recommend actions

## 🎯 AUTONOMOUS STRATEGY

### Path 1: Collections Acceleration (Target: $6,000)
**ACI Enterprises owes $6,000 across 6 invoices**

Actions I'm taking:
- [ ] Research if Stripe dunning/auto-reminders are enabled
- [ ] Document collection status for human follow-up
- [ ] Surface this to any available team member

### Path 2: Subscription Revenue (Target: $2,000+)
**Weekly subscriptions are auto-collecting**

Expected this week:
- Koala Concrete: $500 (auto)
- David Monter: $187.50 (auto)
- **Weekly total: ~$687.50**

### Path 3: Lead Generation Optimization (Target: Indirect)
**Optimize Meta campaigns for better ROI**

- Current: $1,219/week spend, ~44 leads
- Goal: Same spend, higher quality leads
- Impact: More leads = more potential closes

### Path 4: Pipeline Preparation (Target: Speed-to-Close)
**Prepare everything so deals close faster when humans engage**

- Document all hot prospects with latest context
- Prepare proposal templates ready to send
- Have payment links ready
- Surface warmest leads daily

## 💀 BRUTAL HONESTY

**The $10K challenge, done 100% autonomously without human sales involvement, is essentially impossible in 7 days.**

Why:
1. B2B sales require trust, calls, negotiations
2. Average sales cycle: 2-4 weeks minimum
3. Payment collection requires human follow-up
4. Largest revenue opportunities need deal closers

**What IS possible autonomously:**
- Auto-collected subscriptions: ~$700-1,000/week
- If ACI pays (unlikely without chase): +$6,000
- Campaign optimizations for future value

**Total realistic autonomous revenue: $700-1,500**

To hit $10K, we need:
- ONE hot prospect to close ($15K-50K pipeline)
- ACI to pay their outstanding ($6K)
- OR a new creative revenue stream

## 🚀 CREATIVE OPTIONS (Thinking Outside the Box)

### Option A: Activate GHL Workflows
- GHL has draft workflows for automated follow-ups
- If published, could warm up cold leads automatically
- Still needs human close, but speeds the funnel

### Option B: Digital Product
- Package MVA research into sellable guide
- Use existing Stripe payment links
- Requires content creation + promotion

### Option C: Partner Revenue Share
- Cases on Demand relationship is active
- Could negotiate rev-share on leads we send
- Requires partnership discussion (human)

### Option D: Affiliate/Ads on MVA Sites
- 9 sites are live with 3,000+ pages
- Could add affiliate links or display ads
- Takes time to set up and generate traffic
