# 📝 Full Ad Copy + Nano Banana Prompts


## AD 1: Quality Volume ⭐ TIER 1
PI ATTORNEYS signing 10+ cases/month:

You have a lead quality problem disguised as volume.

Your vendor sends 100 MVA leads. Your intake qualifies 15. You sign 5. You blame intake for the 85 that didn't qualify.

But those 85 were never going to sign. They weren't real injury cases. They weren't high intent. They were clicks, not clients.

Here's the real solution: Stop receiving leads. Start receiving signed cases.

We fund the marketing. We generate the demand. Our MVA-trained intake team qualifies prospects and closes retainers on your behalf.

~$2,900 average cost per signed case. 87% of partners renew after 90 days.

No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

Quality isn't just upstream. It's delivery.
📌 PROMPT: Near-black (#1A1A1A) background with subtle data visualization texture. TOP: "THE MATH YOUR VENDOR DOESN'T SHOW YOU" in white header. CENTER: Side-by-side calculator displays. LEFT (LEAD MODEL): 100 leads → 15 qualified → 5 signed → CPA $4,000, "YOU DO THE WORK" stamp. RIGHT (CLOSED CASE MODEL): 100 prospects → 65 qualified → 25 signed → CPA ~$2,900 in #3399FF, "WE DO THE WORK" stamp. BOTTOM: "Same budget × We close = 5X signed cases". Financial calculator aesthetic. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, soft gradients, emojis.

## AD 2: Intake Defense
PI ATTORNEYS signing 10+ MVA cases/month:

They're not dropping the ball. They were handed garbage.

When 85% of your "leads" are unqualified from the start—wrong injury type, no treatment, liability issues, already retained—no amount of training fixes that.

Your intake team isn't a filter for junk. They're supposed to close real cases.

Here's how to actually fix it: We pre-qualify every prospect before you ever see them. Verified injury. Confirmed liability. Insurance checked.

Your team stops sorting and starts closing.

~$2,900 average cost per signed case. 87% partner retention.

No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

Stop blaming downstream for upstream problems.
📌 PROMPT: Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "YOUR INTAKE ISN'T THE PROBLEM" with crossed-out funnel icon. CENTER: Intake workers buried by avalanche of "JUNK LEADS" papers. Red "BAD LEADS" stamp. BOTTOM: Blue process flow "QUALIFIED DEMAND → MVA-TRAINED TEAM → SIGNED RETAINER → ~$2,900 PER CASE". DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, emojis.

## AD 3: Speed Myth
FOR PI LAW FIRMS signing 10+ cases/month:

You can call in 30 seconds. You can have the best intake script. You can follow up seven times. None of it matters if the lead wasn't a real injury case to begin with.

Most PI firms try to solve conversion problems at intake. They hire trainers. They buy dialers. They run reports.

But they're optimizing the wrong part of the funnel.

Here's the actual fix: stop receiving leads entirely.

We fund the marketing. Our MVA-trained intake team qualifies and closes retainers. You receive signed cases—not contacts to chase.

~$2,900 average cost per signed case. 87% of partners renew.

No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

Stop optimizing intake. Start receiving signed cases.
📌 PROMPT: Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "SPEED WON'T FIX BAD LEADS" with crossed-out speedometer in red. CENTER: Funnel with debris labeled "UNQUALIFIED LEADS". Red X callouts: "Faster dialer", "Better scripts", "More follow-ups". Red "ELIMINATED" stamp. BOTTOM: Blue flow "HIGH-INTENT → WE CLOSE → SIGNED RETAINER → ~$2,900". DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, emojis.

## AD 4: Vendor Secret ⭐ TIER 1
PI ATTORNEYS signing 10+ cases/month:

Most lead vendors don't generate leads. They aggregate them. They buy from the same sources as everyone else, then resell to multiple firms in your market.

That "exclusive" lead you just paid $300 for? Three other attorneys got the same one.

You're not competing on intake speed. You're competing against vendors who sold you the same prospect.

Here's actual exclusivity: We run one campaign per market. One firm. Your cases aren't shared, resold, or recycled. The demand we generate is yours.

~$2,900 average cost per signed case. 87% of partners stay past 90 days.

No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

Real exclusivity. Not vendor marketing speak.
📌 PROMPT: Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "THE VENDOR DIRTY SECRET" in bold white. CENTER: Split comparison. LEFT (red tint, "SHARED LEADS"): Single lead splitting to multiple firm icons, "Multiple firms = 1 lead", red X. RIGHT (blue tint, "EXCLUSIVE LEADS"): Single lead to single firm with checkmark, "One firm = one lead". BOTTOM: Blue glowing box "1 CAMPAIGN = 1 FIRM". DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, emojis.

## AD 5: ROI Simple
PI ATTORNEYS signing 10+ MVA cases/month:

$2,900 per signed MVA case. That's the average. No surprises. No intake burnout. No wondering which leads will convert.

How it works:
1. We fund the Meta ads targeting MVA victims in your state
2. Our MVA-trained intake team qualifies and closes retainers
3. You receive signed cases ready to litigate

You don't pay for leads. You don't pay for clicks. You don't pay for intake.

You pay for signed retainers.

~$2,900 average. 87% partner retention. No monthly retainer required.

Predictable cost. Predictable cases. Predictable growth.
📌 PROMPT: Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "$2,900 PER SIGNED MVA CASE" with $2,900 in large #3399FF glowing text. CENTER: Clean three-step process. STEP 1: "We Fund Ads" with Meta icon. STEP 2: "We Qualify & Close" with intake icon. STEP 3: "You Receive Signed Cases" with gavel in #3399FF. Calculator showing crossed-out "Cost per lead", "Cost per SIGNED CASE: $2,900" with checkmark. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, emojis.

## AD 6: Top Firms Quiet
PI ATTORNEYS:

It's not because they don't know. It's because the moment a source becomes public knowledge, it becomes crowded.

Every "best lead vendor" thread on Reddit is a list of sources that stopped working the moment they got popular.

The best acquisition systems aren't found in forums. They're built quietly, operated exclusively, and never shared.

That's what we do:

One campaign per market. One firm. No marketplace. No reselling. The demand we generate is yours—and only yours.

~$2,900 average cost per signed case. 87% partner retention.

No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

The best systems aren't crowdsourced.
📌 PROMPT: Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "WHY TOP FIRMS NEVER SHARE THEIR SOURCES" with lock icon. CENTER: Social media mockup "Best PI Lead Vendors?" with generic replies. Large "DECOY" stamp in muted blue. Arrow: "Where average firms shop". BELOW: Dark box with #3399FF border "What top firms use: Private systems. One firm per market." Badge: "LIMITED PER MARKET". DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, emojis.

## AD 7: Rage Bait ⭐ TIER 1
PI ATTORNEYS:

They sold you 100 "exclusive" leads at $200 each. That's $20,000.

You signed 5 cases.

$4,000 per signed case. For leads that three other attorneys also received.

Meanwhile, they collected $80,000 from four firms for the same 100 people.

You're not the customer. You're the product.

They don't want you to close cases. They want you to keep buying leads.

We're different. We don't sell leads. We deliver signed retainers.

~$2,900 average cost per signed case. 87% partner retention. You pay for results, not hope.

No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

Stop being the product. Start being the firm that wins.
📌 PROMPT: Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "YOUR LEAD VENDOR HOPES YOU NEVER READ THIS" in aggressive white font. CENTER: Calculator showing vendor math: "100 leads x $200 = $20,000" → "5 cases signed" → "$4,000 per case" in red. Contrast box: "THEIR TAKE: $80,000 from 4 firms for same leads". Arrow to "YOU'RE THE PRODUCT" stamp. BOTTOM: "Stop being the product." with "~$2,900 per signed case" in #3399FF. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, emojis.

## AD 8: FOMO
PI ATTORNEYS signing 10+ cases/month:

While you're sorting through junk leads and blaming intake.

While you're paying $4,000+ per case and calling it "normal."

While you're wondering why your cost per acquisition keeps climbing.

They're not smarter than you. They just found a better system first.

And every week you wait, they're signing more cases in YOUR market.

We only work with one firm per market. When it's taken, it's taken.

~$2,900 average cost per signed case. 87% partner retention.

No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

Your market is either yours or someone else's. Choose.
📌 PROMPT: Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "YOUR COMPETITORS ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS" in bold white. CENTER: Map with markets marked. Some highlighted green "TAKEN", others blue "AVAILABLE".

DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, emojis.

## AD 9: Time Angle
PI ATTORNEYS signing 10+ cases/month:

Every hour your team spends sorting junk leads is an hour not spent on billable work.

Every consultation with an unqualified prospect is time stolen from real cases.

Every follow-up on a dead lead is opportunity cost.

What if you got that time back?

We handle the entire front end. We fund the marketing. We generate demand. We qualify. We close. You receive signed cases.

~$2,900 average cost per signed case. 87% partner retention.

No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

Buy back your time. Receive signed cases.
📌 PROMPT: Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "YOUR TIME IS WORTH MORE THAN SORTING LEADS" with clock icon. CENTER: Two paths.

RIGHT (blue): "OUR MODEL" showing clean path "Signed cases delivered" with time freed up. BOTTOM: "Buy back your time." with "~$2,900 per case" in #3399FF. DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, photos, emojis.

## AD 11: Burnout Angle
PI ATTORNEYS signing 10+ cases/month:

Calling 100 leads to find 5 real cases is soul-crushing work.

Hearing "I already have a lawyer" 20 times a day breaks motivation.

Chasing people who don't remember filling out a form destroys morale.

Your team didn't sign up to be professional garbage sorters.

What if they only talked to qualified, interested prospects ready to sign?

That's what we deliver. Signed cases. No sorting required.

~$2,900 average cost per signed case. 87% partner retention.

No retainers. No setup fees. No ad spend required.

Give your team work worth doing.
📌 PROMPT: Near-black (#1A1A1A) background. TOP: "YOUR TEAM IS EXHAUSTED. HERE'S WHY." CENTER: Overwhelmed intake worker with stacks of rejected leads. Counter: "100 calls → 5 cases".

DO NOT INCLUDE: rounded corners, warm colors, actual people, emojis.
