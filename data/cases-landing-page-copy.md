## WHY IT WORKS SECTION

### Section Headline
**Why Firms Switch to Signed Case Delivery**

### Pain Point 1: Lead Quality
**The Problem:** You're paying $200-500 per "lead" that's been sold to 3 other firms. You're racing competitors to the phone.

**Our Solution:** Every case we deliver is generated exclusively for your firm. Never shared. Never resold.

### Pain Point 2: Intake Burden
**The Problem:** Your team spends hours chasing bad leads. 85% don't qualify. Morale suffers. Time bleeds.

**Our Solution:** We handle all intake. Your team only sees signed cases ready to work.

### Pain Point 3: Unpredictable Costs
**The Problem:** You spend $20k on leads, sign 5 cases, and realize you paid $4,000+ per case after intake costs.

**Our Solution:** ~$3,000 per signed case. Predictable. No hidden costs. No hoping.

## FAQ SECTION

### Section Headline
**Questions Attorneys Ask**

---

**Q: How is this different from buying leads?**

When you buy leads, you're buying contact information. You still have to call, qualify, follow up, and close. Most leads don't convert, and you're paying your intake team to sort through garbage.

With signed case delivery, we handle all of that. You receive cases with retainers already signed. Your only job is to litigate.

---

**Q: What does "signed case" actually mean?**

A signed case means the prospect has executed your fee agreement. We use YOUR retainer documents. The case arrives with: signed agreement, intake notes, and recorded call. Ready for your docket.

---

**Q: How do you guarantee 7 cases in 30 days?**

We've delivered thousands of signed cases. We know what it takes. If we don't hit 7 in your first 30 days, we keep running campaigns at our cost until we do. No credits — actual case delivery.

---

**Q: Are the leads exclusive to my firm?**

Yes. Every case we deliver is generated exclusively for your firm. We never share or sell cases to other firms.

---

**Q: What states do you operate in?**

We generate MVA cases in 30+ states including Texas, Florida, California, Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and more. Apply to check availability in your market.

---

**Q: What if a signed case doesn't meet quality standards?**

If a case we deliver doesn't meet our agreed qualification criteria (verified injury, clear liability, not currently represented), we replace it. We stand behind our work.

---

**Q: How fast can we start?**

Most firms see their first signed cases within 2-3 weeks of kickoff. We need a few days to set up your campaign and fee agreement integration, then our intake team starts working the pipeline.

---

**Q: Is there a long-term contract?**

No. No auto-renew. No long-term commitment. Run a campaign, get your cases, decide if you want to continue.

---

## FINAL CTA SECTION

### Section Headline
**Ready to Stop Buying Leads?**

### Final Copy
You've paid enough for leads that don't convert. You've spent enough hours chasing bad prospects. You've lost enough cases to firms with better marketing.

It's time to buy outcomes, not hope.

~$3,000 per signed case. 7 cases in 30 days — guaranteed.

We fund the marketing. We close the cases. You litigate.
