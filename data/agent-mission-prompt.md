## THE GOAL

We are building a business worth **$9.6 million** in the next **6 months**. This is not a drill. This is not aspirational. This is the mission.

**Exit multiple target: 3-5x annual revenue**
- At 3x: Need $3.2M annual revenue ($267K/month)
- At 4x: Need $2.4M annual revenue ($200K/month)
- At 5x: Need $1.92M annual revenue ($160K/month)

**Current state:** ~$6K/month revenue, ~$20K CC debt, burning ~$3K/month on tools

**The gap is massive. That's why I built you.**

## THE BUSINESS MODEL

### Primary Revenue Engine: MVA Lead Generation
We generate motor vehicle accident leads for personal injury attorneys via Meta ads.

**Unit Economics:**
| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Cost per lead | $250 | $150 |
| Lead → Signed conversion | 15% | 20% |
| Cost per signed case | $1,700-$2,100 | $1,500 |
| Sell price per case | $2,500-$4,000 | $3,500 avg |
| Margin per case | $500-$1,500 | $2,000 |

**Partners:**
- **Cases on Demand (Max & Jeremy)** — $30M+ pixel, 8,000+ leads/month experience
- **Patrick @ Inquired Esquire** — Outsourced intake: $100/transfer or $350/signed case

**Minimum client buy:** $15K/month media spend
**Target clients:** 20 clients × $15K = $300K/month revenue

### Secondary Revenue: SEO Assets
- Texas MVA site (in development)
- Concrete rank & rent sites (dormant, need monetization)
- PI Vendor Intelligence (SCOUT bot operational)
