# MVA OFFERS v2 - KURIOS + COD

## Pricing Logic
- **Signed Cases** = Anchor (best deal per case)
- **Live Transfers** = 1/2 signed price (at 40% sign rate → ~1.25x cost per case vs signed)
- **Form Fill Leads** = Priced so 10% conversion → ~1.5-1.75x cost per case vs signed

This creates upsell ladder: Leads → Transfers → Signed Cases
