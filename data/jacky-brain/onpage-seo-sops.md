## 📌 Title Tag Formulas

*Based on Jacky Chou's research and testing*

### Best Practices

1. **Include primary keyword at the beginning** of title
2. **Keep under 60 characters** to avoid truncation
3. **Include location for local SEO** - e.g., "Best Roofer in Vancouver"
4. **Use power words** - "Best", "Top", "#1", "2026"
5. **Match search intent** - transactional vs informational

### Formulas

```
[Primary Keyword] in [Location] | [Brand]
Best [Service] in [City] - [Company Name]
[Number] Best [Product/Service] in [Location] ([Year])
[Primary Keyword] - [Secondary Keyword] | [Brand]
```

### Examples

- `Best Vancouver Roofing | ABC Roofing`
- `10 Best Deck Builders in St. Louis (2026)`

## 📑 Content Structure & Formatting

*How to structure articles for maximum SEO impact*

### Header Hierarchy

```
H1: Main Keyword (Only ONE per page)
  H2: Major Section Topics
    H3: Subsections
      H4-H6: Further breakdowns
```

### Content Structure Rules

1. **Keyword in first 100 words** - Get your main keyword in the first paragraph
2. **Use subheadings every 200-300 words** - Break up content for readability
3. **Bullet points and numbered lists** - Makes content scannable
4. **Short paragraphs** - 2-3 sentences max for better mobile readability

## 🔗 Internal Linking Strategies

*How to build topical authority through internal links*

### Core Principles

1. **Pillar-Cluster Model** - Main pillar page links to cluster content, cluster links back
2. **Contextual links within content** - Natural links within paragraphs
3. **Every page should have internal links** - Both incoming and outgoing
4. **Use descriptive anchor text** - Include keywords naturally

### Implementation

```
Pillar Page (eg. "Local SEO Guide")
    ├── Cluster: "GBP Optimization" → links back to pillar
    ├── Cluster: "Citation Building" → links back to pillar
    ├── Cluster: "Review Management" → links back to pillar
    └── All clusters link to each other
```

### Best Practices

- Link new content to existing related pages
- Update old content with links to new posts
- Use 3-5 internal links per 1000 words
- Footer and sidebar links for important pages
- Don't overuse exact-match anchor text

---

## 🎯 Keyword Placement Rules

*Where and how to place keywords for maximum impact*

### Primary Keyword Placement

1. ✅ **URL slug** - `example.com/best-roofer-vancouver`
2. ✅ **Title tag** - At the beginning
3. ✅ **H1 heading** - Exactly once
4. ✅ **First paragraph** - Within first 100 words
5. ✅ **Meta description** - Naturally included
6. ✅ **Alt text** - On at least one image
7. ✅ **Subheadings** - In 1-2 H2s

### Secondary Keywords

- Distribute throughout body content
- Use in H3-H4 subheadings
- Include in alt text for other images
- Use in FAQ section questions

### Avoid

- ❌ Keyword stuffing
- ❌ Exact match keywords in every heading
- ❌ Multiple H1 tags
- ❌ Forced, unnatural placement

## 🤖 AI SEO/GEO Strategies (2026)

*From EP 744 - The Complete AI SEO/GEO Course*

### Google AI Overviews

- Takes front page of Google, sometimes extends to position 10-20 with YouTube embedded
- To rank: press releases → parasites → guest posts → blog articles + backlinks + BrowserBlast
- Getting mentions on Reddit posts that rank on Google >>> you don't even need to be ranked, just be in the thread
- YouTube videos are highly cited - "best xyz" content works great
- Facebook Groups emerging but not being cited yet

### ChatGPT Rankings

- **Schema is overrated BUT just do it** - it's a "why not"
- **Press releases help** - Use services like abnewswire.com
- **Listicles, comparisons, and reviews everywhere** - On your blog, other blogs, PBNs
- **BrowserBlast works esp well** if you don't have a lot of traffic

### LLM Citation Strategies

- LLM Citations work best for enterprise
- LLM PBN works best for "best seo companies in [location]" queries
- LLM guest posts work best for "best [service]" queries
- LLM research paper works best for product queries (like "best vpn canada")

## 🏠 Rank and Rent SEO

*From EP 587 - The Complete Rank and Rent Course*

### What is Rank and Rent?
Build and rank a website for specific local keywords, then rent out the site (and its leads) to a business for a monthly fee.

### Pricing Formula

```
Search Volume × CTR × CR × AOV × Margins × 50%

Example: "vancouver roofing" → 2.9k searches/month
2900 × 0.3 (CTR) × 0.15 (form fill) × 0.05 (close rate) × $20,000 × 0.25 × 0.5 = $16k/mo potential
```

### Domain & Website Setup

- **Domains:** Use exact match domains (EMDs)
- **Website:** GeneratePress or simple builders
- **Structure:** Single page sites work for local keywords (very easy!)
- **On-Site SEO:** Use ChatGPT, include keyword in H1s, meta title, FAQ schema + local schema

### Ranking Strategy

**90% of people will rank #1 with:**
1. Citations + foundational links
2. After that: niche edits + BrowserBlast

### Cold Email Template for Pitching

**Subject:** quick question {first name}

```
Hi {first name},

We have extra leads who are looking for [service] in [City].

Do you have the capacity to service an extra 20-25 clients a month?

Best,
[Name]
```

## ❌ Common Local SEO Mistakes

*From EP 555 - Audited 1000+ businesses*

1. **Refreshing rankings at wrong times of day**
2. **Not indexing citations** - Build them AND make sure they get indexed
3. **Aggressive CTR software = clap city** - Don't overdo it
4. **Caring about citation 'quality'** - Quantity matters more
5. **Not enough reviews = bad CTR = bad rankings**

---

## 💡 Easy Local SEO Wins

*From EP 499 - Quick wins for immediate results*

### 1. Real businesses = easy wins
- Actual brick-and-mortar locations are easiest to rank
- Strong brand signals: Directions CTR, Brand searches
- If you're using fake GMBs... you're probably going to get clapped

### 2. Tons of real reviews = walk in the park
- If a client has way more legit reviews than top snack pack listings, it means the community loves them
- They just need foundational tweaks

### 3. High foot traffic + no rankings = goldmine
- Businesses with real traffic but no visibility
- They're likely one small tweak away from blowing up
- Technical issue → fix it → rankings in 7 days

### 4. Review optimization = easy lever
- Check if reviews mention target keywords (if not, missed opportunity)
- Are they replying to reviews? If not, fix it
- Prompt customers to drop keywords in their reviews
