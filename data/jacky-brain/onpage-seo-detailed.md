Google AI Overviews

- Takes front page of Google, but sometimes it extends out to position 10-20 if you have YouTube embedded
- To rank on Google, easiest way is press release, parasites, guest posts, then articles on your blog (AI overviews identifies self shilling) + backlinks + browserblast
- Getting mentions on Reddit posts that rank on Google >>>>>> you dont even need to be ranked, as long as you’re in the thread you are crawled
- YouTube videos are highly cited, best xyz ones, check out what James Dooley is doing
- Facebook Groups emerging, but not being cited
ChatGPT

- Schema is overrated BUT just do it its a why not
- Press releases help, just do it,  abnewswire.com  
- Listicles, comparisons, and reviews everywhere
- On your blog, on other peoples blogs, on PBNs just fucking everywhere

## 📄 Complete Rank and Rent Course

*96 items*


📄 **July 18 EP 587 (The Complete Rank and Rent SEO Course)**


📄 **Build in Public References**


#### What is a rank and rent?

Rank and rent is an SEO strategy where you build and rank a website for specific local keywords, then rent out the site (and its leads) to a business for a monthly fee (could be pay per lead as well).


#### Why rank and rent?

Very easy to rank so low barrier, recurring revenue, and easy sell


#### How to pick niches?

TL;DR just go through localrank’s local lead packs


#### How to validate demand?

Pricing Rank and Rents

Search volume x CTR x CR (form fill rate x client conversion) x AOV x Margins x 50%

Example:

“vancouver roofing” → 2.9k searches per month

CTR @ position 1 is roughly 30%

Form fill rate is roughly 15%

Lead to client rate is roughly 5%

AOV is $20k

Margins is roughly 25%

2900 x 0.3 x 0.15 x 0.05 x $20,000 x 0.25 x 0.5 = $16k/mo

IF you get 100 leads a month

100 x 5% x $20k x 25% x 25%= $6.25k/mo


#### Domain & Website Setup

Domains: TLDR just go with exact match domains

Website setup: if you know how already, just go with generatepress and design it yourself, if you can’t, we’ll do it for you if you host with  https://simplehost.so/ . First designs on us, and you can replicate and change the content yourself.

Site Structure: most sites can get away with single page site since its local keywords VERY EASY

On-Site SEO: Just use chatGPT lol, remember to include your target keyword in H1s and have meta title, maybe FAQ schema + local schema use  ‣


#### Bonus: Get a GBP

If you can, register a GBP, either legit or not legit

Legit = rent an office in your city etc.

Not legit = pay someone to reg $150-$300 a pop (not recommended)


#### Ranking your Rank and Rent

90% of people will rank #1 directly with citations + foundational links

Foundational links, use the free swipe files found on Local Rank Academy (3000+ sites to build backlinks)

Citations, just use Local Boost + Local Rank citations

After that just use niche edits  https://indexsy.spp.io/order/niche-edits  + BrowserBlast and you’ll get there TRUST


#### Tracking

Use  https://callscaler.com/pricing/?via=indexsy  

Whisper + call recording + call tracking

Contact form fills


#### Monetizing Your Site (Renting/Selling Leads)

Pricing model, already covered flat 

PPL networks or pay per call networks work well, i used ringpartner, was pretty great

There’s a couple ways to pitch your rank and rents…

1. Cold email (scalable) ← works best for me
1. Cold call (only if you’re not awkward af and NO ACCENT)
1. Walk in and pitch (only if you have that chad aura)

#### Cold Email

Setup

1. Buy domain eg. tryindexsy.com, instead of sending indexsy.com
1. Create 3 email accounts per domain, eg.  jacky@tryindexsy.com ,  jack@tryindexsy.com ,  jackson@tryindexsy.com
1. Setup email forwarding eg. all the above should forward to  hello@indexsy.com
1. Technical setup eg. DMARC and DKIM need to be setup
Leads, can be done via Fiverr or scraped using Outscraper

Email Template (FOR DIRECTORIES)

Subject: Best {{personalization}} (Location) Realtor Listicle on Indexsy.com

{{Hi | Hey | Hello}} there,

I'll be quick, we rank on the front page of Google for the term "best {{personalization}} realtor" and just about every variation of it.

Would you be interested in being included at #1 here?

{{INDEXSY URL}}

Email Template (FOR RANK AND RENTS)

Subject: quick question {first name} OR quick question OR Deck Builder Quote

Hi {first name},

We have extra leads who are looking for deck builders in St. Louis.

Do you have the capacity to service an extra 20-25 clients a month?

Best,

Jacky


#### Cold Call

This isn’t something I’m super confident with, but it’s something where you need to get your reps in. Just pick up the phone and pitch. If you are young, just say that, eg. Hi there, I’m an 18 year old marketer, do you have 5 minutes where I can tell you about how I can make your business show up higher on Google?

## 📄 Easy Local SEO WINS

*47 items*


📄 **April 9 EP 499 (Easy Local SEO WINS (Checklist ✅))**


📄 **Build in Public References**

1. Real businesses = easy wins

- Should go without saying, but actual brick-and-mortar locations are easiest to rank.
- Why? Strong brand signals like:
- If you're using fake GMBs... you’re probably clapped.
2. Tons of real reviews = walk in the park

- If a client has way more legit reviews than top snack pack listings?
- It means the community loves them — they just need foundational tweaks.
3. High foot traffic + no rankings = goldmine

- Businesses with real traffic but no visibility?
- They’re likely one small tweak away from blowing up.
- Technical issue → fix it → rankings in 7 days.
4. Review optimization = easy lever

- Check if reviews mention target keywords. If not, that’s a missed opportunity.
- Are they replying to reviews? If not, fix it.
- Tell them to prompt customers to drop keywords in their reviews. Easy win.
