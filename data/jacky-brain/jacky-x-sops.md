### Google AI Overviews Strategy

**Ranking Priority Order:**
1. Press releases
2. Parasites (Digg, FB Groups, LinkedIn)
3. Guest posts
4. Articles on your blog (AI overviews identifies self-shilling!)
5. Backlinks
6. BrowserBlast CTR

**Key Insights:**
- AI Overviews takes front page of Google
- Sometimes extends to position 10-20 if you have YouTube embedded
- **Getting mentions on Reddit posts that rank on Google >>> your own rankings**
- You don't even need to be ranked - as long as you're in the thread you get crawled
- YouTube videos are highly cited (check what James Dooley is doing)
- Facebook Groups emerging but NOT being cited yet

### ChatGPT Ranking Strategy

**Schema:** Overrated BUT just do it - it's a "why not"

**Press Releases:** Help. Just do it. Use abnewswire.com

**Listicles, comparisons, and reviews EVERYWHERE:**
- On your blog
- On other people's blogs
- On PBNs
- Just fucking everywhere

**Different tactics for different query types:**

| Query Type | Best Tactic |
|------------|-------------|
| Enterprise queries | LLM Citations from LocalRank.so (ONLY ChatGPT) |
| "best seo companies in [city]" | LLM PBN (ONLY ChatGPT) |
| "best seo companies" | LLM guest posts |
| "best vpn canada" style | LLM research paper method |

## 📊 Microsoft AEO/GEO Official Guide (Jan 2026)
> **Source:** EP 741 - Microsoft's official PDF breakdown

### The Big Idea (Simple Terms)

AI tools decide who to recommend based on:
1. What they can read about you
2. Whether they trust it
3. Whether they can actually buy from you

**If any one breaks → you don't get mentioned or you lose the sale.**

### 7-Step Implementation Checklist

#### 1. Make Your Website Work for AI Buyers (CRITICAL)

AI doesn't "browse" like a human — it tries to:
- Add product to cart
- Apply discounts
- Calculate shipping
- Checkout
- Confirm order

**If any step fails → AI gives up and recommends someone else.**

**Do Today:**
- Buy one of your own products on desktop + mobile
- Test with discount code + different shipping location
- Fix anything that errors or feels flaky

**If checkout is broken, nothing else matters.**

#### 2. Make Product Info Identical Everywhere

AI hates confusion.

**If:**
- Your page says $49
- Your feed says $59
- Your schema says "out of stock"

**→ AI just stops trusting you.**

**Do This:**
- Make price, availability, sizes, colors match:
  - On the page
  - In your product feed
  - In the code behind the page
- Update inventory and pricing automatically, not manually

#### 3. Explain Products Like Talking to a Smart Friend

AI pulls answers from clear explanations, not marketing fluff.

**Bad:** "Premium high-quality solution for modern lifestyles"

**Good:** "Best for cold weather walks, stays warm below 40°F, lightweight, waterproof zipper"

**On every product page, clearly say:**
- Who it's for
- What problem it solves
- When it's a bad fit (yes, really)

#### 4. Add Q&A Section to Every Product Page

AI LOVES Q&A because it can quote it directly.

**Add 5-10 real questions like:**
- Is this good for winter?
- Does it fit true to size?
- Can I use this with X?
- How long does shipping take?

Write short, direct answers. This makes AI more likely to cite you.

#### 5. Show Proof That Real Humans Trust You

AI doesn't trust claims. It trusts evidence.

**Do This:**
- Show real reviews (with star ratings)
- Highlight how many people bought it
- Link to articles mentioning you
- Link to certifications/badges
- Avoid hype words you can't prove

#### 6. Describe Your Images and Videos Properly

AI can't "see" — it reads descriptions.

**Do This:**
- Write clear image descriptions: "Black insulated jacket with reinforced zipper and extended hood"
- Add captions/transcripts to videos explaining features

#### 7. Don't Lie, Exaggerate, or Be Vague

**AI penalizes:**
- "Best ever"
- "#1 product"
- Claims with no proof

**Do instead:**
- Use specific facts
- Use comparisons
- Admit limitations

**AI prefers boring truth over flashy lies.**

### TL;DR Checklist (Do These 5 Things First)
1. ✅ Fix checkout + purchasing flow
2. ✅ Make prices/stock identical everywhere
3. ✅ Clearly explain who the product is for
4. ✅ Add Q&A blocks to product pages
5. ✅ Show real reviews and proof

**That alone puts you ahead of 90% of sites right now.**

### Schema Types to Deploy (Non-Negotiable)
Deploy JSON-LD for:
- Product
- Offer
- AggregateRating
- Review
- Brand
- ItemList
- FAQ

**Required dynamic fields:** price, availability, color, size, SKU, GTIN, dateModified

## 🔴 Reddit Marketing SOP (Jan 2026)
> **Source:** EP 742 | **Stats:** 10k+ comments, 85% stick rate

### The 10-Minute Reddit Domination Method

**Goal:** Get your brand into threads that already rank on Google, push comment to top 3 for evergreen traffic.

#### Step 1: Pick 5 "Money Keywords"
- "best [category]"
- "[category] recommendations"
- "[category] vs [category]"
- "is [brand] worth it"
- "best [category] for [use case]"

**Rule:** If you can imagine someone buying within 7 days = money keyword

#### Step 2: Find Ranking Threads
Use Trackings.ai → Discover

**Look for:**
- Threads already ranking on Google
- 20+ comments
- Recent activity OR evergreen

#### Step 3: Placement Type (Safest → Riskiest)

| Type | Risk | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Unlinked mention | Safest | "I've been using Trackings.ai and it's been solid…" |
| Nofollow link | Medium | Link to neutral resource page |
| Direct link | Highest | Only if subreddit allows |

**Rule:** Start with unlinked, graduate to links after proving survivability

#### Step 4: "Human Stack" Comment Template

```
Line 1: Empathy → "I had the same problem…"
Line 2: Mini story → "Tried 2–3 options, wasted money/time…"
Line 3: Soft recommendation → "Trackings.ai ended up being the easiest…"
Line 4: Balanced comparison → "If you just need X, tool A works. If you want Y, this is better…"
Line 5: Anti-shill exit → "not sponsored, just what worked for me"
```

**Survival tips:**
- Lowercase is fine
- One small typo is fine
- DON'T say "game changer", "revolutionary", "introducing"

#### Step 5: Timing Strategy

**New thread:** Be early (first 5 comments = most lifetime visibility)

**Existing ranking thread:** Be useful, answer OP directly, add specific detail proving you're real

#### Step 6: "Conversation Stack" for Top 3

To rank top 3, need replies + upvotes:
- Main comment
- 1st reply (agree / add detail)
- 2nd reply (tiny tip / personal note)

Make each reply feel like different person.

#### Step 7: Safe Boost Pattern
- Zero votes first 2 weeks
- Drip over 2 days
- Stop at top 3 (you're "visibility locked")

#### Step 8: Maintenance
- Removed? Rewrite and re-place in different thread
- Slipping from top 3? Small drip boost
- Every 30-60 days → add fresh reply to keep alive
