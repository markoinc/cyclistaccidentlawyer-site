## Local SEO Fundamentals

### The 3 Core Google Ranking Factors
1. **Relevance** - Does your business listing match searcher intent?
2. **Distance/Proximity** - How close is your business to the searcher?
3. **Prominence** - How popular/reputable is your business (reviews, backlinks, mentions)?

### Key Insight from Jacky Chou
> "Local SEO = Google Map Pack visibility. Ranking is hyper-local. You can't rank a suburban office for a downtown query—get an address near your target market."

## On-Site SEO Checklist

*From @boringlocalseo: "On-site SEO for local is stupid easy and shouldn't take more than 30 mins"*

### 1. Local Business Schema Markup
- Add LocalBusiness schema to every page
- Include: business name, address, phone, email, hours, logo, description
- Use Google's Structured Data Testing Tool to validate
- **Free Tool:** LocalRank.so/tools/local-business-schema-generator/

### 2. NAP Data (Name, Address, Phone)
- Display NAP info in the footer of every page
- Create individual location pages if you have multiple locations
- Ensure NAP consistency across site AND all listings
- Format: Pick one format and use it EVERYWHERE (e.g., "Street" not "St.")

### 3. Title Tags
- Create unique, relevant title tag for each page
- Include your keyword toward the beginning
- Mention your location (city, neighborhood)
- Example: "Heating & Cooling in Dallas, TX – Joe's HVAC Services"

### 4. H1 & Headers
- Include city + service keywords in H1s
- Use keyword variations in H2-H6 headers
- One H1 per page, be specific to the service/location

### 5. Homepage Content
- Add city + service keywords naturally
- Mention the neighborhood/areas you serve
- Write a solid description of what you do and where

### 6. Location-Specific Pages
- Create pages like /city/service (e.g., /dallas/hvac-repair)
- Each location page should link to its own GBP listing
- Unique content per location (no copy-paste!)

### 7. Mobile Optimization
- 88% of local searches happen on mobile
- Fast loading (under 3 seconds)

## Google Business Profile (GBP) Optimization

### GBP = 33% of All Local Pack Signals

### Core GBP Optimization Steps

1. **Claim & Verify Your GBP**
   - Verify via postcard, phone, or email
   - For multiple locations: Use Google's Bulk Location Management Tool

2. **Complete ALL Fields**
   - Business name (exact match to real name - NO keyword stuffing)
   - Address (exact, consistent format)
   - Phone number (local number preferred)
   - Website URL
   - Business hours (including special hours/holidays)
   - Business description (include local keywords naturally)

3. **Choose the Right Categories**
   - Primary category = most important (e.g., "Pizza Restaurant" not just "Restaurant")
   - Add ALL relevant secondary categories
   - Categories determine which searches you appear for

4. **Upload Photos & Videos**
   - Profile photo (eye-catching, represents business)
   - Cover photo
   - Interior & exterior photos
   - Product/service photos
   - Team photos
   - Update regularly (shows activity)
   - Businesses with lots of photos get more clicks and calls

5. **Services & Products**
   - Add all services with descriptions
   - Include keywords in service descriptions
   - Add products if applicable

6. **Q&A Section**
   - Seed common questions yourself
   - Answer quickly when new questions appear
   - Include keywords in answers naturally

7. **Google Posts**
   - Post updates, offers, events regularly
   - Makes listing more dynamic
   - Shows Google you're active

8. **Attributes**
   - Add all relevant attributes (wheelchair accessible, free Wi-Fi, etc.)
   - Helps with specific searches

### GBP Engagement Signals (Ranking Boost)

From Jacky Chou's workshop:
- Encourage "Directions" clicks on GBP
- Staff/friends can search → click directions → visit office (sends strong signals)
- Hosting meetups or events at your office = mass "directions" signals
- Website clicks & CTR manipulation boost rankings
- **"Treat Google like a popularity contest—engagement tells them you're the winner"**

## Citation Building

### What Are Citations?
Online mentions of your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) on directories, websites, and platforms.

### Citation Types
1. **Structured** - Business directory listings (Yelp, YellowPages, etc.)
2. **Unstructured** - Mentions in blog posts, news articles, "Best of" guides

### Why Citations Matter
- Account for ~7% of local search signals
- Validate your business exists and is legitimate
- Inconsistent NAP = lower rankings

### Priority Citation Sites
1. Google Business Profile
2. Apple Maps
3. Bing Places
4. Yelp
5. Facebook Business
6. YellowPages
7. BBB (Better Business Bureau)
8. Industry-specific directories (Healthgrades, Avvo, Angi, etc.)
9. Local chamber of commerce
10. Local city/regional directories

### Citation Building Strategy

1. **Audit Existing Citations**
   - Search your business name, address, phone
   - Find inconsistencies and duplicates
   - Note incorrect listings

2. **Correct Inconsistencies**
   - Update incorrect NAP across all platforms
   - Use exact same format everywhere
   - Remove duplicates

3. **Build New Citations**
   - Start with major directories
   - Add industry-specific directories
   - Include local/regional directories
   - **LocalRank.so can build 500+ citations with one click**

4. **Index Citations Faster**
   - Use Telegram Indexer bot to submit URLs to Google
   - Speed up the indexing process

### Jacky's PBN Citation Hack (Gray Hat)

## Review Generation & Management

### Reviews = Top 3 Local Pack Ranking Factor

### Why Reviews Matter
- Social proof for customers
- Direct ranking factor
- 63% of consumers check Google reviews before visiting
- Quality + Quantity + Velocity (how often you get reviews)

### Review Generation Strategies

1. **Ask Directly** - Train staff to ask happy customers
2. **Post-Visit Emails** - Automated follow-up with direct link
3. **SMS Notifications** - Text message review requests
4. **QR Codes** - At checkout, on receipts, on tables
5. **Review Landing Page** - Create easy URL (yoursite.com/review)

### Review Response Strategy

**For Positive Reviews (4-5 stars):**
- Thank them for the review
- Mention specific details they mentioned
- Include target keywords naturally
- Invite them back

**For Negative Reviews (1-3 stars):**
- Respond calmly and professionally
- Apologize for their experience
- Take conversation offline (provide contact)
- Show you care about fixing issues

### Review Velocity
- Steady stream of reviews > bulk reviews at once
- Aim for consistent new reviews monthly
- Don't fake reviews (Google will catch you)

### Automated Review Response (LocalRank.so feature)
- If 4 stars or higher: Thank + plug target keywords
- If 3 stars or lower: Apologize + ask to make it right
