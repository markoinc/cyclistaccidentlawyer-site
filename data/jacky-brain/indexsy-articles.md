## CTR Statistics 2026 & AI Overview Impact
**Source:** https://indexsy.com/ctr-statistics/
**Date:** January 2026 - ⭐ CRITICAL READ

### The Core Problem in 2026
Ranking positions are no longer the only "positions" that matter. A #1 blue link can be visually displaced by:
- AI Overviews
- Featured snippets
- Local packs
- "People Also Ask"
- Video/image blocks
- Shopping units

### 2026 CTR Baseline Table (Clean SERPs)

| Google Rank | CTR (2026) |
|-------------|------------|
| Ad Position 1 | 2.10% |
| Ad Position 2 | 1.40% |
| #1 | 26.40% |
| #2 | 12.10% |
| #3 | 6.70% |
| #4 | 4.80% |
| #5 | 3.40% |
| #6 | 2.90% |
| #7 | 2.00% |
| #8 | 1.40% |
| #9 | 1.20% |
| #10 | 1.00% |

### CTR by SERP Feature (2026)
| Element | CTR |
|---------|-----|
| Featured Snippet (top) | 42.9% |
| AI Overview (top) | 38.9% |
| People Also Ask | 3.0% |
| Knowledge Panel | 1.4% |

### 🚨 AI Overviews: The CTR Squeeze

**Key Finding:** AI Overviews reduce the need to click and concentrate remaining clicks.

#### AI Overview Prevalence
- ~30% of U.S. desktop keywords show AI Overviews (late 2025)
- Strong skew toward informational intent
- Expanded to 100+ countries, 1B+ monthly users (Oct 2024)

#### The Data on CTR Impact

**BrightEdge (May 2025):**
- Impressions: +49%
- CTR: **-30%**

**Seer Interactive:**
- Organic CTR dropped from ~1.41% → ~0.64% on queries with AI Overviews
- Being CITED in AI Overview = better CTR than being excluded

### The "Two-Curve" Model for 2026

#### Curve A: Classic CTR (Clean SERPs)
Use for:
- Branded/navigational queries
- Transactional queries without heavy modules
- SERPs without AI Overviews

#### Curve B: AI/Feature-Heavy CTR
Expect:
- More impressions
- Lower CTR
- Bigger performance difference based on AI Overview citation

### Local SERP CTR (Remains Strong)
| Local Pack Position | CTR |
|---------------------|-----|
| #1 | 17.6% |
| #2 | 15.4% |
| #3 | 15.1% |

### How to Protect Clicks in 2026

#### 1. Optimize for AI Citations
Content patterns that get cited:
- Clear, definition-first sections (40-70 words)
- Tight subsections answering single sub-questions
- Tables summarizing comparisons/steps
- Evidence: quotes, references, dates, screenshots
- Consistent entity language

#### 2. Make Snippets "Obviously Worth Clicking"
Promise what AI summary won't deliver:
- Templates, scripts, checklists, calculators
- Step-by-step SOPs with screenshots
- Updated numbers with dates
- Tools or datasets
- Nuanced answers for specific audiences

#### 3. Shift KPI Expectations
New metrics to track:
- Share of queries where you're cited in AI Overviews
- Brand search lift
- Conversion rate and revenue per click
- Diversification metrics (email, community, YouTube)

#### 4. Build Assets AI Can't Replace
- Proprietary data
- Fresh experiments and screenshots
- Tools and calculators
- Real-world case studies
- Experience-based recommendations

### Zero-Click Trend
- Zero-click news searches: 56% → 69% YoY
- Organic traffic to news sites: -26% since AI Overviews launch
