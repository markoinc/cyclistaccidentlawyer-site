## 🔴 REDDIT DOMINATION (Your #1 Priority)

### The Core Strategy
Reddit ranks for "best X" queries on Google. Get your comment into top 3 = evergreen traffic.

### Account Setup
1. **Buy aged accounts** with karma (PlayerUp, Accs Market)
2. **Warmup SOP:** https://x.com/indexsy/status/1965126923425587621
3. **Or use cloud phones** (DuoPlus, VMOS) to run multiple accounts
4. **crowdreply.io** for comments/upvotes boost

### Finding Targets
- Search "best [your category]" on Google
- Find Reddit threads that rank
- Use Trackings.ai to discover ranking threads
- Look for threads with 20+ comments (alive enough to blend in)

### The "Human Stack" Comment Template
```
Line 1: Empathy — "I had the same problem…"
Line 2: Mini story — "Tried 2–3 options, wasted money/time…"
Line 3: Soft rec — "[Brand] ended up being the easiest…"
Line 4: Balanced comparison — "If you just need X, tool A works. If you want Y, this is better…"
Line 5: Anti-shill exit — "not sponsored, just what worked for me"
```

### Style Rules (Survival)
- lowercase is fine
- one small typo is fine
- DON'T say "game changer", "revolutionary", "introducing"
- DON'T sound like a landing page
- DON'T link directly to your brand (mention name only)

### The "Conversation Stack" (Boost to Top 3)
Use multiple accounts to create replies under your comment:
- Account 1: Main comment
- Account 2: Short reply agreeing — "+1, same experience"
- Account 3: Slightly more detailed reply
- Account 4: Tiny tip / personal note

Makes your comment look like a real mini-thread.

### Upvote Pattern
- DO NOT nuke with upvotes instantly
- Drip over 2 days
- Stop once you hit top 3
- Once top 3 = "visibility locked"

### Maintenance
- Every 30-60 days: add a fresh reply to keep it alive
- If comment gets removed: rewrite and re-place in different thread
- If slips from top 3: small drip boost

### For Your Business (leads.kuriosbrand.com)
Target keywords:
- "best truck accident lawyer Texas"
- "MVA attorney recommendations"
- "PI lawyer worth it"
- "best personal injury lawyer [city]"

Sample comment:
> "Had a friend go through this after a semi wreck on I-35. They tried a few lawyers who wouldn't take the case. Ended up finding someone through Kurios (some lead matching service) and got way more than they expected. Not sure if they're nationwide but worth checking if you're in Texas."

## 🔴 7-DAY APPOINTMENT SEQUENCE

### Speed-to-Lead Rules
- **Call within 5 minutes** (critical)
- No pickup → immediate SMS → Email fires instantly
- Call window: 9am-7pm
- 3 call attempts/day for first 2 days
- Then 1 call/day until day 5

### Sequence Structure
**Day 0:** Lead comes in → Call immediately → SMS → Email 1
**Day 1:** 3 more call attempts → Email 2
**Day 2:** 3 more call attempts → Email 3 (shift tone to educational)
**Day 3-5:** 1 call/day → Nurture emails
**Day 5+:** Move to long-term nurture if no response

### Automation Logic
- If "Booked" tag applied → exit sequence
- If no answer after Day 3 → shift tone to education + trust
- Track in simple sheet: Status = New / Called / Booked / No Answer / Not Interested
