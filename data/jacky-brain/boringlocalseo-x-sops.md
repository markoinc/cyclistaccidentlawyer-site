## 🤖 GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Strategy for 2026

### What is GEO?
**Generative Engine Optimization** = optimizing content to appear in AI-generated answers (ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, Claude).

### GEO vs Traditional SEO:
| Traditional SEO | GEO |
|-----------------|-----|
| Rank pages | Get cited in AI answers |
| Clicks to website | Brand mentioned without click |
| Keyword targeting | Entity/concept optimization |
| Backlink quantity | Authority density |
| Traffic metrics | Citation tracking |

### Top GEO Tactics for Local Businesses:

#### 1. Create "Best Of" Listicles
- **43.8% of ChatGPT citations** come from listicle content
- Create your own: "Best [Service] in [City] 2026"
- Get featured in others' listicles (local news, bloggers)
- **Unstructured citations** (mentions in "Best of [City]" even WITHOUT links) now stronger than directory profiles

#### 2. Answer Engine Optimization
- Write conversational FAQ content
- Structure content for AI summarization
- Use clear headers, bullet points, tables
- Target question-based queries

#### 3. Build Topical Authority
- Create content clusters around your services
- Connect concepts (not just keywords)
- AI seeks **connected concepts**, not keyword density
- Studies show **no correlation** between keyword density and AI rankings

#### 4. Entity Optimization
- Consistent NAP across ALL platforms
- Schema markup (LocalBusiness, Service, Review, FAQ, Event)
- Wikipedia/Wikidata presence (if possible)
- Directory listings for LLM recognition

#### 5. Content Depth Matters Most
> "When it comes to securing AI mentions and citations, content depth (sentence and word counts) and readability matter most, while traditional SEO metrics like traffic and backlinks have little impact." — Growth Memo, March 2025
