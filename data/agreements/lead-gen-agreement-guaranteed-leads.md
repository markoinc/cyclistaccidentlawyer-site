## 1. SCOPE OF SERVICES

Provider will generate and deliver exclusive Motor Vehicle Accident ("MVA") leads to Client in the following state(s): {{contact.custom_field.state}}.

Leads will be delivered 24/7 unless otherwise specified during onboarding.

## 2. LEAD DEFINITION & TCPA COMPLIANCE

A "Lead" is defined as a unique consumer submission that includes:
- Valid contact information (name, phone number, email address)
- State/ZIP code within approved geography
- Incident type (Auto, Truck, Uber/Lyft, Pedestrian, Motorcycle)
- Incident timing within approved timeframe

All Leads are captured via TCPA-compliant web forms with verifiable one-to-one consent specific to Client, as required by FCC regulations effective January 27, 2025. Consent includes: consent text, timestamp, and IP address.

Leads are generated exclusively for {{contact.company}} and are not shared with or transferred from other buyers.

**Prepayment:** Full investment amount is due prior to campaign launch.

**THE GUARANTEE:** Provider guarantees delivery of the specified number of Leads for the stated investment. If Provider does not deliver the guaranteed number of Leads, Provider will continue delivering Leads at Provider's cost until the guarantee is fulfilled.

Expected Delivery is an estimate, not a guarantee. Actual delivery timeline may vary based on campaign performance and market conditions.

This is a lead-count guarantee only. No refunds will be issued; all performance adjustments are made via additional lead delivery.

Provider may adjust ad creative, targeting, and delivery based on campaign data to improve performance.

## 7. COMPLIANCE & ADVERTISING
