## LEADS (Raw Form-Fill Leads) - Top 10 Objections

### 1. "I've tried lead gen before and it didn't work"
**Response:** "Most lead gen fails because vendors aggregate old, shared leads. Our campaigns generate fresh, exclusive leads from $30M+ in seasoned ad accounts. The pixel knows what converts. Our clients see 15% conversion rates because we only do 1-year-old leads, not the 2-year garbage everyone else sells."

### 2. "I don't want to chase leads - it's a waste of my time"
**Response:** "I completely understand - that's why we partner with our intake director at our intake team. He calls within 5 minutes, 4x on day one, 3x daily for a week. He filters the junk and only transfers qualified prospects. You just answer warm transfers. Or for $350/case, he signs them for you."

### 3. "The leads cost too much - I need guarantees on cost per case"
**Response:** "Our media buy model means you get the raw cost of the lead. In Michigan that's ~$200-250. At 15% conversion, you're at $1,500-2,000 per case. California is $350/lead, ~$3,500/case. We'll put a cap in writing - if your case cost exceeds our target, we credit you with more media until you hit it."

### 4. "What if the leads are junk - wrong numbers, no injury, not in my area?"
**Response:** "About 85% won't be cases - that's industry standard. But the 15% that do convert are worth $10-15k in attorney fees each. That's 5-7x ROI on marketing. our intake director's team filters them so you only talk to qualified prospects with clear liability, treatment within 21 days, and real injuries."

### 5. "I need to know exactly what I'm getting - I hate black-box media buys"
**Response:** "Total transparency. You'll see every lead in real-time. You get email/text notifications instantly. We can tie into your API. You see the lead's accident date, injury type, treatment status. Nothing hidden - we just run dedicated campaigns for you, nobody else shares your funnel."

### 6. "I've been burned by agencies - they all say the same thing"
**Response:** "I hear you. The difference is we don't charge per lead - we run media buys so you pay raw ad cost. Our incentive is your success so you renew. We've run $30M through our accounts. We work with Angel Reyes, Jacobi, Walker Advertising - they've been with us for years because it works."

### 7. "15% conversion seems low - that's 85 leads I'm paying for that go nowhere"
**Response:** "That 15% is industry standard for raw leads. The question is: what's your cost per case? If you're paying $250/lead x 100 = $25,000 and sign 15 cases, that's $1,666 per case. Your fee is $10-15k per case. That's 6-9x return. The math works even if conversion seems low."

### 8. "I want pay-per-lead, not a media buy I can't control"
**Response:** "I can do pay-per-lead at $350/lead if that's more comfortable for a first test. But you're paying more for no extra value - just our risk margin. In media buy, you get leads at $250 because we pass the savings through. Try 50 leads at $350 ($17.5k), then switch to media buy once you see it works."

### 9. "What happens if the campaign underperforms?"
**Response:** "We'll have a conversation and fix it. If leads are $400 instead of $250, I'm not going to just shrug - we'll adjust targeting, creative, whatever it takes. And we guarantee a minimum case cost. If we don't hit it, we run more media until we do. No auto-renew - you're in control."

### 10. "I need cases, not leads - I could give a shit about leads"
**Response:** "Then let's skip the middleman. For $350/case, our intake director signs them for you. You get signed retainers delivered to your door. All you do is litigate. That's our 'We Close' tier - about 10-12 signed cases for $35k. Real cases, not prospects."

## LIVE TRANSFERS - Top 10 Objections

### 1. "I've paid for transfers that were garbage - wrong numbers, no injury, no case"
**Response:** "our intake director's team calls 4x on day one, 3x daily for a week before they transfer. They verify: clear liability, treatment within 21 days, no prior attorney (or definitely wants new one). You're only charged $100 for transfers that actually happen - and 40-60% of those convert to signed cases."

### 2. "I want to vet the lead myself before I pay"
**Response:** "You can. Raw leads are $250 and you call them yourself. Or our intake director calls and transfers - you talk to them, decide if it's a case, THEN sign. You're only paying $100 for the transfer. If you don't want the case, don't sign it. The $100 covers the qualification work."

### 3. "What qualifies as a 'qualified transfer'?"
**Response:** "Clear liability, treatment within 21 days of accident (or still within that window), they're not represented or actively want to switch, real injury that's monetizable. our intake director was a Director of Intake for 4 years - he knows what a case looks like. You set your criteria and he follows it."

### 4. "30% transfer rate seems low - I'm paying for 70% dead leads"
**Response:** "You're not paying for the 70%. You pay $100 per transfer that happens. So 100 leads × 30% = 30 transfers × $100 = $3,000. You sign ~15 cases from those 30 transfers (50% close rate). Your transfer cost per case is $200. The leads cost ~$2,500/case total. Still 5x ROI."

### 5. "What if the 'qualified' transfer isn't actually qualified when I talk to them?"
**Response:** "Every call is recorded. You can review and dispute. If our intake director's team said they have insurance and they don't, or said clear liability and they got the ticket - talk to our intake director about credits. Reasonable drops happen to everyone, but blatant misqualification can be credited."

### 6. "I don't have capacity to take calls during business hours"
**Response:** "Tell our intake director your hours. He only transfers during your availability window. Morning only? Afternoons only? Specific days? He'll work around your schedule. Leads get worked until they transfer on YOUR timeline."

### 7. "Live transfers feel like pressure - the prospect doesn't get to think"
**Response:** "These are people who actively filled out a form saying they want to talk to an attorney. our intake director confirms they're ready to talk NOW before transferring. They want this. If someone needs time, our intake director notes it and follows up later. You only get warm, ready prospects."

### 8. "I've used call centers before - they don't know legal, just read scripts"
**Response:** "our intake director was Director of Intake at a law firm for 4 years. He built the firm from zero. He's not reading scripts - he's having real intake conversations, hearing things that matter, knowing what has legs. He's trained his team the same way. Night and day from Alert Communications or LCC."

### 9. "I'm already working with another transfer vendor - why switch?"
**Response:** "Don't switch - diversify. Vendors have good months and bad months. Multiple sources smooth out your pipeline. Our leads are exclusive to you, fresh (within 1 year), and come from dedicated campaigns. Test us with one buy and compare conversion rates side by side."

### 10. "$100/transfer seems cheap - what's the catch?"
**Response:** "The 'catch' is you're also paying for the leads that generate those transfers. Total cost is leads ($250/ea) plus transfers ($100/ea on the 30% that convert). Works out to ~$2,000-3,000 per signed case. We make money on volume and retention, not by overcharging per transfer."

## SIGNED CASES (Retainers Delivered) - Top 10 Objections

### 1. "I've paid for signed cases that fell apart - no insurance, lied about fault"
**Response:** "Some attrition is inevitable - it happens when you sign cases in-house too. The question is: what percentage? Industry standard is 10-15% attrition. Everything is recorded. If pattern issues emerge, we adjust criteria. our intake director can credit cases that clearly shouldn't have been signed."

### 2. "Quintessa signed people who didn't even know they signed - I got bar complaints"
**Response:** "We're not Quintessa. our intake director has real conversations - he's a former intake director, not a click-farm. The prospect actively fills out a form, answers a call, goes through qualification, and signs YOUR retainer on a recorded line. No surprises, no 'I never agreed to this.'"

### 3. "$350/case sounds too cheap - Walker charges $2,500"
**Response:** "You're paying for the leads AND the signup. $250/lead, 15% convert, plus $350 signup = ~$2,000-2,500 total cost per signed case. It's the same economics as Walker, just unbundled so you see exactly what you're paying for. No hidden margin."

### 4. "$350/case sounds too expensive - why not just take transfers and close myself?"
**Response:** "Transfers are $100, you close ~50% of them. So 2 transfers per case = $200 + your time. If your time is worth more than $150/case, let our intake director close. If you love intake and want that relationship-building, take transfers. Most attorneys prefer to litigate, not sell."

### 5. "What's your criteria for a 'signed case'?"
**Response:** "We set it together before launch. Standard: accident within 1 year, treatment within 21 days (or still in window), clear liability, insurance coverage, no prior attorney (or confirmed switch). You want trucking only? Specific injury minimums? We match your criteria exactly."

### 6. "What if the signed case drops after 30 days?"
**Response:** "If they drop for reasons our intake director should have caught (no insurance when they said yes, at-fault when they said not), let's review the recording. Credits are possible. If they drop because the client went ghost or changed their mind after signing - that's cost of doing business. Happens in-house too."

### 7. "I need skin in the game from the vendor - I've had all the risk before"
**Response:** "We guarantee a minimum case delivery. You pay $35k, we guarantee 10 cases minimum. If we don't hit 10, we run more media until we do. That's our skin in the game. We only win if you win. No 'sorry it didn't work out, keep your invoices.'"

### 8. "How do I know you won't sign garbage just to hit quotas?"
**Response:** "our intake director's reputation and livelihood depend on quality. He's building a business, not burning bridges. Everything is recorded. Your criteria is documented. If we start pushing junk, you stop buying and tell everyone. We're incentivized to deliver real cases you can monetize."

### 9. "I want to meet who's signing my cases before I commit"
**Response:** "Absolutely. Let's set up a call with our intake director. Talk criteria, hear his background (4 years as intake director, built a firm from zero). He'll explain his process. You should feel good about who's representing your firm on the phone. This isn't some random offshore call center."

### 10. "The attrition rate from these vendors is always higher than they claim"
**Response:** "Ask about attrition upfront and we'll be honest. Signed cases will have some attrition - 10-15% is normal. The question is: at what cost per RETAINED case are you profitable? If cost per signed is $2,500 and 15% drop, cost per retained is $2,940. Still 3-4x ROI on $10k fees."
