## 🎯 KURIOS BUSINESS MODEL

Kurios is a **fixed-price lead whitelabeler** for personal injury (PI/MVA) law firms. We buy from wholesale providers (Cases on Demand, Inquire2Esquire) and resell with guaranteed delivery.

**Not a media buy agency** — we sell **guaranteed quantities** at fixed prices.

## 📞 SALES TERMINOLOGY

| Signed Cases | Retainers delivered, ready to litigate |
| Contingency Fee | 33-40% (standard PI structure) |
| Gap in Care | Time between accident and treatment (7-14 days = red flag) |

## 🚫 MARKET GAPS WE SOLVE

1. **Pre-qualification gap** — Solos can't handle lead volume
2. **Transparency gap** — Vendors won't disclose ad spend vs fees
3. **Contact freshness gap** — Old leads, wrong numbers
4. **Non-exclusive leads** — Multiple attorneys racing for same case
5. **Agency trust gap** — $60k contracts, no results
6. **Small firm options** — Big agencies don't serve smaller budgets
7. **Lead verification** — No way to validate before paying
8. **Intake support** — Solos need help sorting junk leads

## 🎯 CALL PREP CHECKLIST

Before each call:
1. Research their firm (size, locations, practice areas)
2. Check their current lead sources (ask: "What's working? What's not?")
3. Identify their persona (Skeptical Veteran, Solo Scaler, Ops Partner, Expansionist)
4. Know their state's pricing
5. Prepare 2-3 case studies relevant to their situation

### Discovery Questions to Ask
1. "What's your current cost per signed case?"
2. "How many cases do you need per month to hit your goals?"
3. "What's been your experience with lead vendors so far?"
