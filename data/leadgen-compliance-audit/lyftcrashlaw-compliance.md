# About Lyft Crash Law

## Who We Are

Lyft Crash Law is a free consultation service connecting Lyft accident victims with experienced rideshare attorneys. **We are not a law firm** — we're a resource that helps injured passengers, drivers, and bystanders find qualified legal representation after a Lyft-related accident.

We specialize exclusively in rideshare accidents because we understand the unique insurance complexities, corporate liability questions, and time-sensitive evidence involved in these cases.

## What We Do

We make it easy for accident victims to get help:

- **Free Case Evaluation** - We review your Lyft accident to help you understand your options
- **Attorney Matching** - We connect you with attorneys who specialize in rideshare accidents in your state
- **Zero Cost to You** - Our service is completely free for accident victims
- **No Obligation** - Get information without any pressure or commitment

## How It Works

### Step 1: Tell Us What Happened
Complete our quick form with basic information about your Lyft accident — takes about 2 minutes.

### Step 2: We Review Your Case
Our team evaluates your situation and identifies the best attorney match based on your case type, location, and specific circumstances.

### Step 3: Attorney Contact
A qualified rideshare accident attorney reaches out to discuss your case, explain your rights, and answer your questions — all at no cost.

## Why It's Free

We're paid by law firms in our network when they take on a case. This means:
- ✅ You never pay us anything
- ✅ Attorneys work on contingency — no fees unless you recover money
- ✅ Our incentive is to connect you with an attorney who will actually help

We don't sell your information to a dozen lawyers who all call at once. We connect you with ONE qualified attorney for your case.

## Why Lyft Accidents Need Specialized Help

Lyft accidents involve complex legal issues:
- **$1 Million Policy** - Lyft provides up to $1M in coverage, but accessing it requires proving driver status and fault
- **Multiple Insurance Layers** - Driver's personal insurance, Lyft's commercial policy, and potentially third-party coverage
- **App Status Critical** - Different coverage applies depending on whether driver was waiting for a ride, en route, or had a passenger
- **Time-Sensitive Evidence** - Lyft trip data, driver ratings, and GPS records must be preserved quickly

An attorney who handles rideshare cases regularly knows how to navigate these complexities.

## Our Promise

- No high-pressure sales tactics
- No selling your info to multiple lawyers
- Transparent about who we are and how we operate
- Committed to connecting you with real help
