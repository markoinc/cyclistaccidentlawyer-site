## Key Insight: Compliance Doesn't Kill Conversions

The compliance language actually **helps** conversions when positioned correctly:

1. **"Not a law firm"** → Reframe as "free consultation service"
2. **"Attorney matching"** → Position as value (we find the right expert)
3. **"One attorney"** → Differentiator vs lead mills
4. **"Paid by law firms"** → Explains why it's free (removes suspicion)

Transparency builds trust. Trust converts.
