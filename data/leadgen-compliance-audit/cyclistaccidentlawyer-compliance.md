# About Cyclist Accident Lawyer

## Who We Are

Cyclist Accident Lawyer is a free consultation service for bicyclists who have been injured in accidents with vehicles, road hazards, or other dangerous conditions. **We are not a law firm** — we're a service that connects injured cyclists with attorneys who understand bike accident cases.

We know the cycling community. We understand that cyclists face unique dangers on the road, often deal with dismissive attitudes from drivers and insurance companies, and deserve attorneys who take their cases seriously.

## What We Do

- **Free Case Evaluations** - We help you understand your legal options after a bike accident
- **Attorney Matching** - We connect you with attorneys who handle bicycle accident cases
- **Cyclist-Focused** - We work with attorneys who respect cyclists' rights on the road
- **No Cost** - Our service is always free for injured cyclists

## How It Works

### Step 1: Tell Us What Happened
Fill out our simple form with details about your bicycle accident — takes about 2 minutes.

### Step 2: We Review Your Case
Our team evaluates your situation and identifies the best attorney match for your specific case.

### Step 3: Attorney Contact
A qualified bicycle accident attorney contacts you to discuss your case and options — free and no obligation.

## Why It's Free

We're paid by law firms when they take on cases. This means:
- ✅ Free for every injured cyclist
- ✅ Attorneys work on contingency — they only get paid if you win
- ✅ We connect you with ONE attorney, not a flood of calls

## Why Cyclist Cases Need Specialized Attorneys

Bicycle accident cases have unique challenges:

- **Serious Injuries** - Cyclists lack vehicle protection; broken bones, head trauma, and road rash are common
- **Anti-Cyclist Bias** - Some drivers, jurors, and insurance adjusters blame cyclists unfairly
- **Road Design Issues** - Poor bike infrastructure, door zones, and lack of bike lanes can be factors
- **Multiple Liable Parties** - The driver, city, vehicle manufacturer, or road maintenance company may share fault
- **Insurance Complexity** - Driver's policy, your health insurance, possibly UM coverage
- **Helmet Arguments** - Insurance companies may use helmet status against you (even where legal)

An attorney experienced in cycling cases knows how to counter anti-cyclist bias and maximize recovery.

## Our Commitment to Cyclists

- We work with attorneys who understand cycling and cyclists' road rights
- We never assume you were at fault
- One qualified attorney — not multiple competing calls
- Transparent about our service and business model
