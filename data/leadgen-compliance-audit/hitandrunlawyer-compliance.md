# About Hit and Run Lawyer

## Who We Are

Hit and Run Lawyer is a free consultation service for victims of hit-and-run accidents. **We are not a law firm** — we're a service that connects hit-and-run victims with experienced attorneys who know how to pursue these challenging cases.

Being the victim of a hit-and-run is devastating. The driver who hurt you fled the scene, and you may feel helpless. But you have options — and we help you find attorneys who specialize in tracking down responsible parties and maximizing your recovery.

## What We Do

- **Free Case Evaluations** - We help you understand your options even when the driver fled
- **Attorney Matching** - We connect you with attorneys experienced in hit-and-run cases
- **All Scenarios** - Pedestrian, cyclist, driver, parked car — we cover all hit-and-run situations
- **No Cost** - Our service is always free for accident victims

## How It Works

### Step 1: Tell Us What Happened
Complete our form with whatever details you have about your hit-and-run accident — about 2 minutes.

### Step 2: We Review Your Case
We evaluate your situation and identify an attorney who handles hit-and-run cases in your area.

### Step 3: Attorney Contact
A qualified attorney contacts you to discuss investigation options, insurance claims, and your legal rights — no cost, no obligation.

## Why It's Free

Law firms pay us when they accept cases. This means:
- ✅ You never pay us anything
- ✅ Attorneys work on contingency — no fee unless you recover compensation
- ✅ We connect you with ONE qualified attorney — not a flood of calls

## Why Hit-and-Run Cases Need Specialized Help

Hit-and-run cases present unique challenges — and opportunities:

### Finding the Driver
Even when the driver flees, they can often be found through:
- Security camera footage
- Witness statements
- Paint transfer analysis
- Debris examination
- Social media investigation
- Police reports

### When the Driver Isn't Found
You may still have options:
- **Uninsured Motorist Coverage (UM)** - Your own auto policy may cover hit-and-run injuries
- **Underinsured Motorist Coverage** - Additional protection if the driver is found but has minimal insurance
- **Crime Victim Compensation** - State programs that help crime victims
- **Third-Party Liability** - Bars that overserved the driver, employers of fleeing drivers, etc.

### The Stakes Are High
Hit-and-run is a crime. This creates:
- Police involvement and investigation
- Potential criminal restitution
- Strong leverage if the driver is identified
- Statute of limitations considerations

An attorney experienced in hit-and-run knows how to investigate, work with police, and pursue all available compensation sources.

## Our Commitment

- Help you even when you think there's no hope
- Connect you with attorneys who investigate aggressively
- One qualified attorney — no spam
- Transparent about who we are
