# About Pedestrian Accident Lawyer

## Who We Are

Pedestrian Accident Lawyer is a free consultation service for people who have been injured while walking, jogging, crossing the street, or simply being a pedestrian. **We are not a law firm** — we're a service that connects pedestrian accident victims with experienced personal injury attorneys who handle these specific types of cases.

Being hit by a car while on foot is terrifying and often results in severe injuries. We're here to help you understand your options and find qualified legal help.

## What We Do

- **Free Case Evaluations** - We help you understand if you have a claim worth pursuing
- **Attorney Connections** - We match you with attorneys experienced in pedestrian accident cases
- **Support for All Situations** - Crosswalk accidents, parking lot incidents, hit-and-run, and more
- **No Cost to You** - Our service is completely free for accident victims

## How It Works

### Step 1: Share Your Information
Complete our brief form with details about your pedestrian accident — just 2 minutes.

### Step 2: We Review Your Case
Our team reviews your situation to find an attorney who handles pedestrian cases in your area.

### Step 3: Attorney Contact
A qualified attorney reaches out to discuss your case, explain your rights, and answer your questions — free of charge.

## Why It's Free

Law firms pay us when they take on cases from our service. This means:
- ✅ You never pay us anything
- ✅ Attorneys work on contingency — no fees unless you recover compensation
- ✅ Our goal is connecting you with real help

We don't sell your information to dozens of lawyers. We match you with ONE qualified attorney.

## Why Pedestrian Accidents Need Special Attention

Pedestrian accidents often involve:

- **Severe Injuries** - Without the protection of a vehicle, pedestrians suffer broken bones, head injuries, spinal damage, and worse
- **High Medical Costs** - Hospitalizations, surgeries, and rehabilitation add up quickly
- **Liability Questions** - Who's at fault? The driver? The city for poor crosswalk design? Multiple parties?
- **Insurance Complexity** - Driver's auto policy, your health insurance, possibly uninsured motorist coverage
- **Hit-and-Run Challenges** - When the driver flees, special legal strategies are needed

An attorney experienced in pedestrian cases knows how to investigate properly and maximize your recovery.

## Our Promise

- No pressure, no obligation
- One qualified attorney, not a swarm of calls
- Transparent about who we are
- Committed to helping accident victims
