# About Rideshare Lawyers Near Me

## Who We Are

Rideshare Lawyers Near Me is a free consultation service for victims of Uber, Lyft, and other rideshare accidents. **We are not a law firm** — we're a specialized service that connects injured victims with attorneys who have experience handling rideshare accident claims.

Whether you were a passenger, another driver, a pedestrian, or even a rideshare driver yourself, we help you find qualified legal representation in your area.

## What We Do

Our service is simple:

- **Free Consultations** - We provide free case evaluations to help you understand your situation
- **Attorney Connections** - We match you with rideshare accident attorneys near you
- **All Rideshare Platforms** - We handle Uber, Lyft, Via, and other TNC accidents
- **Zero Cost** - Our service is always free for accident victims

## How It Works

### Step 1: Share Your Story
Fill out our brief form with details about your rideshare accident — it takes just 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Case Review
We review your submission to understand your situation and identify the right attorney for your case type and location.

### Step 3: Get Connected
A qualified rideshare accident attorney contacts you to discuss your case and options — no cost, no obligation.

## Why We're Free

Law firms in our network compensate us when they accept cases. This creates a win-win:
- ✅ Victims get free help finding an attorney
- ✅ Attorneys connect with people who need their help
- ✅ No one pays unless they win their case

We're selective about our attorney partners — they must have experience with rideshare accident cases specifically.

## Why Rideshare Accidents Are Complex

Rideshare cases involve unique legal challenges:

- **Three Insurance Policies**: Driver's personal coverage, rideshare company's policy, and potentially at-fault third parties
- **App Status Rules Everything**: Coverage varies dramatically based on whether the driver was offline, waiting for a ride, or transporting a passenger
- **$1M+ Policies Available**: But accessing rideshare company insurance requires proving specific circumstances
- **Digital Evidence**: Trip records, driver history, and GPS data need to be preserved quickly

A general personal injury lawyer might not know these nuances. We connect you with attorneys who do.

## Our Standards

- We connect you with ONE qualified attorney — not a list of lawyers fighting for your case
- We're transparent about our business model
- We never pressure you to take action
- We protect your privacy
