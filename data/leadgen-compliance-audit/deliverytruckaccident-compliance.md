# About Delivery Truck Accident

## Who We Are

Delivery Truck Accident is a free consultation service for people injured in accidents involving delivery vehicles — Amazon vans, FedEx trucks, UPS vehicles, USPS trucks, food delivery drivers, and more. **We are not a law firm** — we're a service that connects accident victims with attorneys experienced in delivery company accident cases.

The explosion of e-commerce and food delivery has put millions more delivery vehicles on the road. When these vehicles cause accidents, victims face unique legal challenges. We help you find attorneys who know how to handle these cases.

## What We Do

- **Free Case Evaluations** - We help you understand your options after a delivery truck accident
- **Attorney Matching** - We connect you with attorneys who handle delivery vehicle cases
- **All Delivery Vehicles** - Amazon, FedEx, UPS, USPS, DoorDash, Instacart, and more
- **No Cost to You** - Our service is always free

## How It Works

### Step 1: Tell Us What Happened
Fill out our form with basic information about your delivery truck accident — about 2 minutes.

### Step 2: We Review Your Case
We evaluate your situation and identify an attorney with experience handling delivery company cases.

### Step 3: Attorney Contact
A qualified attorney contacts you to discuss your case and legal options — free and no obligation.

## Why It's Free

Law firms pay us when they accept cases. This means:
- ✅ You never pay us anything
- ✅ Attorneys work on contingency — no fee unless you win
- ✅ We match you with ONE attorney — not a dozen competing calls

## Why Delivery Truck Cases Are Different

Delivery vehicle accidents involve unique factors:

- **Corporate Defendants** - Amazon, FedEx, and UPS have deep pockets and aggressive legal teams
- **Contractor vs. Employee** - Many delivery drivers are "independent contractors" — companies use this to avoid liability
- **Route Pressure** - Delivery drivers face intense time pressure, leading to rushed driving
- **Vehicle Maintenance** - Delivery vehicles rack up huge mileage; maintenance issues are common
- **Surveillance Evidence** - Many delivery vehicles have cameras and GPS that can prove fault
- **Varying Coverage** - Insurance varies dramatically depending on driver status and company

You need an attorney who understands how to pierce corporate defenses and hold the right parties accountable.

## Companies We Handle Cases Against

- Amazon Delivery (DSP drivers and Amazon Flex)
- FedEx (Ground and Express)
- UPS
- USPS
- DoorDash
- Uber Eats
- Instacart
- Grubhub
- Local and regional delivery services

## Our Commitment

- No pressure, no obligation
- Transparent about our service
- Focused on getting you real help
