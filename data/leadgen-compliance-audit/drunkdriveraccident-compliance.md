# About Drunk Driver Accident

## Who We Are

Drunk Driver Accident is a free consultation service for victims of accidents caused by drunk, impaired, or intoxicated drivers. **We are not a law firm** — we're a service that connects DUI accident victims with experienced attorneys who pursue maximum compensation for these preventable tragedies.

Being hit by a drunk driver is infuriating. Someone chose to drink and drive, and you're paying the price. We help you find attorneys who hold drunk drivers — and everyone who enabled them — accountable.

## What We Do

- **Free Case Evaluations** - We help you understand your legal options after a drunk driving accident
- **Attorney Matching** - We connect you with attorneys who handle DUI accident cases aggressively
- **All Impaired Driving** - Alcohol, drugs, prescription medications — we cover all forms of impaired driving
- **No Cost** - Our service is always free for accident victims

## How It Works

### Step 1: Tell Us What Happened
Fill out our form with details about your drunk driving accident — about 2 minutes.

### Step 2: We Review Your Case
We evaluate your situation and identify an attorney experienced in DUI accident cases in your area.

### Step 3: Attorney Contact
A qualified attorney contacts you to discuss your case and options — no cost, no obligation.

## Why It's Free

Law firms pay us when they accept cases. This means:
- ✅ You never pay us anything
- ✅ Attorneys work on contingency — no fee unless you win
- ✅ We match you with ONE attorney who will fight for you

## Why Drunk Driving Cases Are Different

DUI accident cases offer unique legal advantages for victims:

### Punitive Damages
Because drunk driving is reckless and intentional, many states allow **punitive damages** — money awarded to punish the drunk driver beyond just compensating your losses. This can significantly increase your recovery.

### Multiple Liable Parties
It's not just the drunk driver who may owe you:
- **Bars & Restaurants** - Dram shop laws hold establishments liable for overserving
- **Party Hosts** - Social host liability in some states
- **Employers** - If driver was working or at a work event
- **Vehicle Owners** - If someone lent their car to an intoxicated person

### Criminal Case Helps Civil Case
When the drunk driver is criminally charged:
- Police gather evidence for you
- BAC tests prove intoxication
- Criminal conviction can be used in your civil case
- Restitution may be ordered

### Higher Settlements
Insurance companies know juries hate drunk drivers. Cases often settle for more because the defense knows they'll lose badly at trial.

## The Justice You Deserve

An experienced DUI accident attorney knows how to:
- Pursue punitive damages
- Investigate who served alcohol to the driver
- Use criminal proceedings to strengthen your case
- Maximize your total recovery
- Hold everyone responsible accountable

## Our Commitment

- Connect you with attorneys who fight drunk drivers aggressively
- One qualified attorney — not multiple competing calls
- Transparent about our service
- Focused on getting you justice
