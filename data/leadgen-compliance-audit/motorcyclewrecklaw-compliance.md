# About Motorcycle Wreck Law

## Who We Are

Motorcycle Wreck Law is a free consultation service for riders who've been injured in motorcycle accidents. **We are not a law firm** — we're a service that connects injured motorcyclists with experienced attorneys who specialize in motorcycle accident claims.

We understand the riding community. We know that motorcycle accidents often result in serious injuries, that riders face unfair bias, and that insurance companies frequently try to blame the motorcyclist. That's why we connect victims with attorneys who actually understand motorcycle cases.

## What We Do

- **Free Case Evaluations** - We help you understand if you have a viable claim
- **Attorney Matching** - We connect you with motorcycle accident attorneys who know bikes and riding
- **Rider-Focused** - We work with attorneys who won't blame you for being on two wheels
- **Always Free** - You never pay us anything

## How It Works

### Step 1: Tell Us About Your Wreck
Fill out our simple form with details about your accident — less than 2 minutes.

### Step 2: We Review Your Case
Our team evaluates your situation to find the best attorney match based on your injuries, location, and case specifics.

### Step 3: Attorney Contact
A qualified motorcycle accident attorney reaches out to discuss your case, your rights, and your options — no cost, no pressure.

## Why It's Free for Riders

We're paid by law firms when they accept cases. This means:
- ✅ Free for every injured rider
- ✅ Attorneys work on contingency — they only get paid if you win
- ✅ Our job is to connect you with someone who will actually fight for you

## Why Motorcycle Cases Are Different

Motorcycle accidents aren't like car crashes:

- **Catastrophic Injuries Common** - Broken bones, road rash, TBI, spinal injuries, and amputations are far more frequent
- **Higher Stakes** - Medical bills often reach six or seven figures
- **Bias Against Riders** - Insurance companies and juries often assume the motorcyclist was at fault or reckless
- **Helmet Law Variations** - State laws affect your claim; some insurers use helmet status against you
- **Visibility Arguments** - "I didn't see the motorcycle" is a common defense that skilled attorneys know how to counter

You need an attorney who understands motorcycle dynamics, rider behavior, and how to combat anti-rider bias.

## Our Commitment to Riders

- We work with attorneys who ride or respect the riding community
- We never assume you were at fault
- We connect you with ONE attorney who knows motorcycle cases
- We're straight with you about our service and how we operate
