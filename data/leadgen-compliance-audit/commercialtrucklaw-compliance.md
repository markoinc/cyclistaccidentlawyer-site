# About Commercial Truck Law

## Who We Are

Commercial Truck Law is a free consultation service for victims of commercial truck and 18-wheeler accidents. **We are not a law firm** — we're a specialized service that connects truck accident victims with experienced attorneys who handle these complex, high-stakes cases.

Truck accidents are different from car accidents. They involve federal regulations, multiple liable parties, and significantly higher damages. We exist to help victims find attorneys who have the resources and experience to take on trucking companies and their insurers.

## What We Do

- **Free Case Evaluations** - We help you understand your situation after a truck accident
- **Attorney Matching** - We connect you with attorneys who specialize in commercial trucking cases
- **All Commercial Vehicles** - 18-wheelers, semi-trucks, delivery trucks, tankers, and more
- **No Cost** - Our service is always free for accident victims

## How It Works

### Step 1: Share Your Information
Complete our form with details about your truck accident — takes about 2 minutes.

### Step 2: We Review Your Case
Our team evaluates your situation to identify an attorney with the right experience and resources for your specific case.

### Step 3: Attorney Contact
A qualified trucking accident attorney reaches out to discuss your case and legal options — no cost, no obligation.

## Why It's Free

Law firms pay us when they accept cases. This creates a system where:
- ✅ You never pay us anything
- ✅ Attorneys work on contingency — no fee unless you win
- ✅ We connect you with ONE qualified attorney, not multiple

## Why Truck Accidents Need Specialized Attorneys

Commercial truck cases are significantly more complex than car accidents:

- **Federal Regulations (FMCSA)** - Hours-of-service rules, maintenance requirements, driver qualification files
- **Multiple Defendants** - Driver, trucking company, cargo loader, manufacturer, maintenance provider
- **Black Box Data** - Electronic logging devices contain critical evidence that must be preserved quickly
- **Corporate Legal Teams** - Trucking companies have lawyers on scene within hours
- **Higher Damages** - Catastrophic injuries mean cases worth $1M+ are common
- **Evidence Destruction Risk** - Trucking companies may "lose" maintenance records or repair damaged trucks quickly

You need an attorney who can move fast, has resources to investigate properly, and has taken on trucking companies before.

## Why Speed Matters

After a truck accident, trucking companies immediately:
- Send investigators to the scene
- Preserve (or destroy) evidence that helps them
- Document everything in their favor
- Prepare their defense

You need an attorney working for YOU just as quickly. We help you find one fast.

## Our Commitment

- We match you with ONE experienced trucking attorney
- No pressure, no spam calls from multiple firms
- Transparent about who we are and how we operate
- Focused on getting you real help
