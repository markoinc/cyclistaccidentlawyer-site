## CREATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS

**For all ads:**
- Test VIDEO vs. static image
- Test carousel format for case studies
- Use lawyer-specific imagery (courtroom, handshake, scales)
- Avoid stock photos — they scream "agency"

**Best hooks to A/B test:**
1. "You've been burned by agencies before"
2. "One case pays for everything"
3. "Only 1 firm per city"
4. "Does your agency own your website?"
5. "Is your law firm visible to AI?"
