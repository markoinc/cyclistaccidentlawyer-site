## Overview

Follow-up is where deals are won or lost. 80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups, yet most salespeople stop after 1-2. SMS follow-up sequences automate persistence while maintaining a personal touch.

---

## Core Principles

### The Follow-Up Rules

1. **Provide Value Each Time** - Don't just "check in"
2. **Vary Your Approach** - Different angles, same goal
3. **Respect Timing** - Space messages appropriately
4. **Make It Easy to Reply** - Clear CTAs
5. **Know When to Stop** - Respect opt-outs and silence

### Optimal Follow-Up Timing

| Touch | Timing | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Immediate | Initial response |
| 2 | 2-4 hours | If no reply, gentle nudge |
| 3 | 24 hours | Add value, new angle |
| 4 | 3 days | Social proof/case study |
| 5 | 7 days | Urgency or new offer |
| 6 | 14 days | Last attempt / breakup |

[Implied "you could have this too" CTA]
```

Curious if we could do the same for you?
```

[Time-sensitive element]

[What they'll miss]

[Easy action to take]
```

If things change, just text me. I'll be here!
