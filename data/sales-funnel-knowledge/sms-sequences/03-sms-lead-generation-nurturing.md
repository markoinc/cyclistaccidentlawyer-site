### Timing Optimization

**Best Times to Send:**
- 10am - 12pm (pre-lunch engagement)
- 2pm - 4pm (afternoon slump = phone check)
- 7pm - 9pm (evening downtime)

**Avoid:**
- Early morning (before 9am)
- Late night (after 9pm)
- Commute times (6:30-8:30am, 4-7pm)
- Mondays (lowest response rates)

### Frequency Guidelines

| Relationship Stage | Recommended Frequency |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| First 7 days | 3-4 messages |
| Weeks 2-4 | 2-3 messages/week |
| Ongoing | 4-6 messages/month |
| Re-engagement | 1 message, then wait |

**Warning Signs of Over-Messaging:**
- Opt-out rate exceeds 2%
- Response rates declining
- Complaints or negative replies

### Message Length

- **Ideal:** 160 characters or less (1 SMS segment)
- **Maximum:** 320 characters (2 segments)
- **Front-load value:** Most important info first
- **One CTA only:** Don't confuse with multiple asks

## Summary: SMS Lead Generation Formula

1. **Capture** → Use multiple opt-in touchpoints
2. **Confirm** → Double opt-in for quality list
3. **Welcome** → Immediate value + set expectations
4. **Nurture** → Value-first content over 7-14 days
5. **Segment** → Personalize based on behavior
6. **Convert** → Clear CTAs with urgency
7. **Measure** → Track metrics, optimize continuously
8. **Comply** → Always respect consent and regulations

**The Golden Rule:** Every SMS should either provide value or give them a reason to reply. If it doesn't do either, don't send it.
