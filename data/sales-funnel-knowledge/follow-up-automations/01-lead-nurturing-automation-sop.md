## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Define Your Goals and Objectives

Before building any automation, clearly define:

- **Primary Goal:** Increase lead generation? Boost conversions? Nurture existing customers?
- **Measurable Target:** Example: "Convert 20% of trial users into paying customers"
- **Timeline:** How long is your typical sales cycle?

### Step 2: Segment Your Audience

**Segmentation Criteria:**

| Factor | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Demographics | Age, gender, job role, location |
| Behavior | Site activity, email engagement, downloads |
| Purchase History | New vs. repeat, cart value, product interest |
| Engagement Level | Highly engaged vs. inactive |
| Lifecycle Stage | Awareness, consideration, decision |

**Action:** Create dynamic lists that auto-update based on criteria.

### Step 3: Map the Customer Journey

**Journey Stages to Address:**

1. **Awareness** - How do they first hear about you?
2. **Consideration** - What information do they need?
3. **Decision** - What convinces them to purchase?
4. **Post-Purchase** - How do you keep them engaged?

### Step 4: Create Your Email Sequences

**Email Types for Each Stage:**

| Stage | Email Content | Timing |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Awareness | Welcome, brand introduction | Immediate |
| Early Interest | Educational content, blog posts | Days 2-4 |
| Building Trust | Case studies, testimonials | Days 5-10 |
| Consideration | Product benefits, comparisons | Days 11-15 |
| Decision | Offer, demo invite, urgency | Days 16-21 |

### Step 5: Set Up Automation Triggers

**Common Triggers:**

- Form submission
- Content download
- Page visits (especially pricing pages)
- Email opens/clicks
- Cart abandonment
- Time-based delays
- Lead score threshold reached
- Segment membership change

### Step 6: Implement Conditions and Branching

**If/Else Logic Examples:**

```
IF subscriber clicks product link A
    → Send product A follow-up sequence
ELSE IF subscriber clicks product link B
    → Send product B follow-up sequence
ELSE (no click)
    → Send general value email
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Personalize Beyond First Name
- Reference specific actions they took
- Tailor content to their industry/role
- Use dynamic content blocks

### 2. Focus on Value First
- Don't always push for the sale
- Send helpful resources, tips, webinars
- Position yourself as an expert

### 3. Use Behavioral Triggers
- If lead visits pricing page multiple times → Send demo offer
- If lead downloads resource → Follow up with related content
- If lead goes inactive → Trigger re-engagement sequence

### 4. Maintain Consistent Timing
- Don't overwhelm: 2-4 emails per week maximum
- Allow breathing room between messages
- Respect time zones

### 5. Clean Your Database Regularly
- Data decays at 2-3% per month
- Remove bounced emails
- Re-engage or remove inactive contacts quarterly

3. **Generic Content** - Personalize based on behavior
4. **Wrong Timing** - Too frequent = annoying; too rare = forgotten
