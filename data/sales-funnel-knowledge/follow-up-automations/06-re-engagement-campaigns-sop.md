## What is a Re-Engagement Campaign?

A re-engagement campaign is a targeted series of communications designed to "win back" subscribers or leads who have stopped engaging with your brand. These contacts once showed interest but have gone cold.

**Why It Matters:**
- Acquiring new customers costs 5-25x more than retaining existing ones
- Re-engaged customers spend 45% more than newly acquired ones
- A clean, engaged list improves deliverability for all emails

## When to Launch Re-Engagement

### Defining "Inactive"

| Business Type | Inactive Definition |
|---------------|---------------------|
| B2B SaaS | No login in 30+ days, no email open in 60+ days |
| B2B Services | No email engagement in 90+ days |
| E-commerce | No purchase in 90+ days, no email open in 45+ days |
| Media/Content | No email open in 60+ days |
| High-ticket B2B | No engagement in 120+ days |

### Segmentation Criteria

Create re-engagement segments based on:

**By Engagement Level:**
- Last email opened: > 30/60/90 days ago
- Last link clicked: > 30/60/90 days ago
- Last website visit: > 30/60/90 days ago
- Last purchase/conversion: > 90/180 days ago

**By Value Tier:**
- High-value (previous purchasers, high engagement history)
- Medium-value (some engagement, never converted)
- Low-value (minimal engagement, low intent signals)

## Measuring Re-Engagement Success

### Key Metrics

| Metric | How to Calculate | Target |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Re-engagement Rate | (Re-engaged ÷ Total targeted) × 100 | 5-15% |
| Open Rate | (Opens ÷ Emails sent) × 100 | 15-25% |
| Click Rate | (Clicks ÷ Opens) × 100 | 3-5% |
| Conversion Rate | (Conversions ÷ Re-engaged) × 100 | 1-3% |
| List Hygiene | Contacts removed | 50-80% of inactive |

### What to Track

**Campaign Level:**
- Total contacts entered
- Re-engaged (by email number)
- Unsubscribed
- Remained inactive (removed)

**Email Level:**
- Open rate (compare to regular campaigns)
- Click rate
- Unsubscribe rate (expect higher than normal)

**Business Impact:**
- Revenue from re-engaged contacts
- LTV of re-engaged vs. new contacts
- Cost savings from cleaner list
