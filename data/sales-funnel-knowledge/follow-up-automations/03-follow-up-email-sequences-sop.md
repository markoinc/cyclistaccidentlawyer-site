## Follow-Up Email Fundamentals

### What is a Follow-Up Email?

A follow-up email is a polite, concise message sent after an initial contact (email, meeting, call) to:
- Remind someone of a previous interaction
- Prompt a response
- Provide additional information
- Keep the conversation moving forward

### Why Send Follow-Up Emails?

1. **Shows Professionalism** - Demonstrates you're organized and serious
2. **Restores Context** - Brings the conversation back
3. **Confirms Next Steps** - Clarifies actions after meetings/calls
4. **Increases Response Rates** - Improves chances of hearing back
5. **Drives Conversions** - Essential for sales where decisions need multiple touchpoints
6. **Builds Relationships** - Nurtures connections after initial introductions

## Step-by-Step: Writing Effective Follow-Ups

### Step 1: Check Your Timing
Before writing, verify:
- [ ] When was the initial email sent?
- [ ] Have you waited appropriate time (2-5 business days)?
- [ ] Is this a reasonable number of follow-ups?

### Step 2: Use the Same Thread
- **Always:** Reply to the original email thread
- **Why:** Provides context, easier for recipient to respond
- **Exception:** After 3+ follow-ups, consider fresh thread

### Step 3: Craft a Clear Subject Line

**Good Subject Lines:**
- "Following up on [Topic]"
- "Quick question about [Subject]"
- "Next steps for [Project]"
- "RE: [Original Subject]" (same thread)

**Bad Subject Lines:**
- "Just checking in"
- "Touching base"
- "Following up" (no context)

### Step 4: Write a Personalized Opening

**Good:**
```
Hi [Name],

Hope your week is going well!
```
```
Hi [Name],

I enjoyed our conversation about [topic] last week.
```

**Avoid:**
- "Hope this email finds you well" (overused)
- No greeting at all
- Overly formal ("Dear Sir/Madam")

### Step 5: Provide Context

Reference the previous interaction in 1-2 sentences:

```
"I wanted to follow up on the proposal I sent last Tuesday regarding [project]."

"Following up on our demo last week where we discussed [topic]."

"I'm circling back on my email from [date] about [topic]."
```

### Step 6: State Your Purpose Clearly

Be direct about why you're following up:

```
"I wanted to check if you had a chance to review the proposal."

"I'm reaching out to see if you have any questions about [topic]."

"I'd love to schedule our next call to discuss implementation."
```

### Step 7: Add New Value

Don't just repeat your previous email. Add something new:

- Relevant case study
- Industry insight
- Helpful resource
- New feature/update
- Different perspective on their problem

```
"I came across this article about [topic] that made me think of our conversation."

"Since we last spoke, we helped [similar company] achieve [result]."

"I wanted to share a quick tip that might help with [their challenge]."
```

### Step 8: Include One Clear CTA

**Good CTAs:**
```
"Would you have 15 minutes this Thursday at 2pm to discuss?"

"Could you reply with your top questions so I can address them?"

"Would you prefer I send the proposal to someone else on your team?"
```

**Avoid:**
- Multiple CTAs
- Vague asks ("Let me know your thoughts")
- No CTA at all

### Step 9: Close Professionally

```
Thank you for your time.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title/Company]
[Phone Number]
[LinkedIn/Website]
```

### Step 10: Proofread

Check for:
- [ ] Typos and grammar
- [ ] Correct recipient name
- [ ] Working links
- [ ] Accurate dates/times
- [ ] Professional tone
- [ ] Under 125 words

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

## Automating Follow-Up Sequences

### When to Automate

**Automate when:**
- Sending 10+ follow-up sequences per day
- Running outbound sales campaigns
- Following up with multiple leads simultaneously
- Needing consistent timing

**Keep manual when:**
- High-value/relationship-critical contacts
- Complex or sensitive situations
- Fewer than 5 follow-ups per day
- Post-meeting/call follow-ups

### Automation Setup Steps

1. **Choose your tool** (HubSpot, Saleshandy, ActiveCampaign, etc.)

2. **Create email templates** for each step in sequence

3. **Set triggers:**
   - Email sent + no reply in X days
   - Link clicked (remove from sequence)
   - Reply received (remove from sequence)

4. **Configure stops:**
   - Reply detected
   - Meeting booked
   - Unsubscribe requested
   - Maximum emails reached

5. **Personalize variables:**
   - {{first_name}}
   - {{company}}
   - {{pain_point}}
   - {{recent_event}}

6. **Test the sequence** with yourself before launching

### Sample Automated Sequence Logic

```
START: Lead enters sequence
  ↓
Send Email 1 (initial outreach)
  ↓
Wait 3 days
  ↓
CHECK: Did they reply?
  ↓ YES         ↓ NO
  EXIT          ↓
              Send Email 2
              ↓
              Wait 4 days
              ↓
              CHECK: Did they reply?
              ↓ YES         ↓ NO
              EXIT          ↓
                          Send Email 3
                          ↓
                          Wait 5 days
                          ↓
                          Send Email 4 (final)
                          ↓
                          Mark as "No Response"
                          ↓
                          END
```
