# Campaign Kickoff Call Outline
*From Cases on Demand Training — Feb 6, 2026*

---

## Purpose
Set client expectations to prevent frustration, reduce support requests, and improve renewal rates.

---

## The Script

### 1️⃣ TIMELINE — What Happens Next
> "Your campaign is going live. You should receive leads within 24-48 hours."

*(Internally: usually same day, but under-promise)*

---

### 2️⃣ CONVERSION EXPECTATIONS
> "It may take 10-25 leads before conversions start coming in."

- You need ~15 conversations to hit your first conversion (at 15% rate)
- Don't be concerned if you get 10 leads without signing anything
- Probabilities require larger sample sizes

---

### 3️⃣ LEAD QUALITY MIX — Set Expectations
Tell them they'll get three types:

| Type | What It Looks Like |
|------|-------------------|
| **Good** | Signable cases you're excited about |
| **Bad** | Unqualified — at-fault, treatment gap, etc. (turn down) |
| **Junk** | Non-responsive, wrong number, "I didn't fill this out" |

> "Do NOT be concerned when this happens. You're just working through leads to find the cases."

---

### 4️⃣ FOLLOW-UP PROTOCOL — Critical Success Factor

**This is the single most important factor for results:**

| When | Calls |
|------|-------|
| **Within 5 minutes** | First call immediately |
| **Day 1** | 4 total calls |
| **Days 2-14** | 3 calls/day for 1-2 weeks |

> "Five calls should have been on day ONE, not total."

---

### 5️⃣ DELIVERY SETUP
- Confirm state(s) for lead delivery
- Provide webhook / API endpoint
- Walk through CRM/GHL if applicable

---

## Who Needs This Call?

✅ **Do it for everyone** — even large firms with intake teams may not know internet leads

> "We were on with Bush and Bush yesterday, and they've got a giant intake team, but it's clear that they don't know what they're doing." — Jeremy

**Benefits:**
- Sets expectations for renewal
- Reduces churn
- Fewer support requests

**Skip only if:** Experienced buyer + limited time
