## Core Thesis

**Before you pay your expenses, take your profit first.** This simple inversion of the traditional accounting formula transforms how you think about and manage business money. Instead of hoping profit appears after all expenses are paid, you guarantee profit by taking it off the top.

Traditional formula: **Sales - Expenses = Profit**  
Profit First formula: **Sales - Profit = Expenses**

This isn't just accounting—it's behavioral economics applied to business. By removing profit first and constraining available cash for expenses, you force yourself to become innovative, efficient, and truly profitable. Run your business based on what you can afford now, not what you hope to afford someday.

## Key Principles

### The Four Core Principles

These principles are based on dietary science research (Parkinson's Law meets behavioral psychology):

#### 1. Use Small Plates
- We consume whatever is on our plate (food or money)
- With one big bank account, you feel rich and spend freely
- Multiple smaller accounts constrain spending and force discipline
- Less available cash = smarter, more innovative spending

#### 2. Serve Sequentially  
- Eat vegetables first (nutritious, low-calorie), then other foods
- Take profit FIRST, pay expenses LAST
- Allocation sequence: Income → Profit → Owner's Pay → Tax → Operating Expenses
- Profit is never forgotten when it comes first

#### 3. Remove Temptation
- Don't keep junk food in the house if you want to eat healthy
- Keep profit accounts out of sight and out of mind
- Use a separate bank (the "no temptation" bank) for Profit and Tax
- Make it hard to "borrow" from yourself

#### 4. Enforce a Rhythm
- Small, regular meals prevent overeating
- Allocate income twice monthly (10th and 25th)
- Check balances daily (a few seconds)
- Pay bills twice monthly
- Quarterly distribution of profit as reward

## The Account Structure

### 5 Core Accounts (Primary Bank)
| Account | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **INCOME** | All revenue deposits here first |
| **PROFIT** | Predetermined profit percentage |
| **OWNER'S PAY** | Your salary |
| **TAX** | Tax reserves |
| **OPEX** | Operating expenses |

### 2 "No-Temptation" Accounts (Secondary Bank)
| Account | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **PROFIT HOLD** | Where profit accumulates (savings) |
| **TAX HOLD** | Where tax reserves accumulate |

**Why a separate bank?** It takes 1-2 days to transfer between banks, adding friction and removing temptation to "borrow" from profit.

## Target Allocation Percentages (TAPs)

Mike provides benchmark TAPs based on "Real Revenue" (Total Revenue minus Materials & Subcontractors if >20% of costs):

### For Service Businesses (Like MVA Lead Gen)

| Real Revenue Range | Profit | Owner's Pay | Tax | OPEX |
|-------------------|--------|-------------|-----|------|
| $0 - $250K | 5% | 50% | 15% | 30% |
| $250K - $500K | 10% | 35% | 15% | 40% |
| $500K - $1M | 15% | 20% | 15% | 50% |
| $1M - $5M | 10% | 10% | 15% | 65% |
| $5M - $10M | 15% | 5% | 15% | 65% |
| $10M - $50M | 20% | 0% | 15% | 65% |

**Note:** These are TARGETS. Start with your Current Allocation Percentages (CAPs) and gradually shift toward TAPs.

## Actionable Frameworks

### The Instant Assessment
1. Calculate Real Revenue (Revenue - Materials/Subs if applicable)
2. Look at actual expenses for last 12 months
3. Calculate what percentage goes to each category currently (CAPs)
4. Compare CAPs to TAPs
5. The gap shows you where to improve

### Implementation Steps

**Week 1: Setup**
1. Open 5 accounts at your primary bank (Income, Profit, Owner's Pay, Tax, OpEx)
2. Open 2 accounts at a different bank (Profit Hold, Tax Hold)
3. Calculate your current CAPs
4. Determine your target TAPs

**Week 2-4: Start Small**
1. Start with 1% to Profit (you won't miss it)
2. Transfer on 10th and 25th
3. Move Profit and Tax to "no-temptation" bank monthly
4. Pay all bills from OpEx only

**Ongoing: Gradual Increase**
1. Increase allocation percentages 1-3% per quarter
2. Goal: Reach TAPs within 12-18 months
3. Review and adjust quarterly
4. Take quarterly profit distributions (50% payout, 50% reserve)

### The 10/25 Rhythm
- **10th of month:** Allocate income based on TAPs, transfer Profit/Tax to no-temptation bank
- **25th of month:** Allocate income based on TAPs, pay bills from OpEx
- **Quarterly:** Distribute 50% of accumulated profit to yourself

### Expense Cutting Framework
When OpEx is too tight, cut in this order:
1. Eliminate expenses that don't serve clients
2. Renegotiate existing contracts
3. Find more efficient alternatives
4. Delay non-essential purchases
5. **Never cut quality to customers**

## Application to MVA Lead Gen Business

### Setting Up Your Accounts
| Account | Bank | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Income | Primary | All client payments deposit here |
| Profit | Primary | 5-15% allocation (start at 5%) |
| Owner's Pay | Primary | Your salary |
| Tax | Primary | 15% reserve |
| OpEx | Primary | Team, tools, ads, etc. |
| Profit Hold | Secondary | Accumulating profit |
| Tax Hold | Secondary | Tax reserves |

### Determine Your Starting TAPs
Based on revenue range, adjust these to match your Current Allocation Percentages initially:

For a ~$250K-$500K lead gen business:
- **Profit:** Start at 5%, target 10%
- **Owner's Pay:** Start at current, target 35%
- **Tax:** 15% (adjust for your actual tax bracket)
- **OpEx:** What remains

### Practical Considerations

**Client Payment Structure:**
- Deposit retainers into Income account
- Allocate immediately on 10th and 25th
- Never spend retainers before allocation

**Managing Variable Revenue:**
- Base percentages on rolling 3-month average
- Build Profit Hold to buffer slow months
- Review allocations quarterly

**Team Costs:**
- Contractors and team come from OpEx
- As you scale, Owner's Pay % decreases, but dollar amount should increase
- If OpEx is too tight, re-evaluate team efficiency

### Profit Distribution Strategy
- Quarterly "owner bonus" from 50% of accumulated Profit
- Celebrate! This reinforces the system
- Other 50% stays as emergency reserve
- Never skip distribution—it's your reward for discipline

## Common Mistakes People Make

### 1. Reducing Quality to Cut Costs
- **Mistake:** Cutting expenses by lowering product/service quality
- **Reality:** This destroys customer satisfaction and long-term revenue
- **Solution:** Find efficiencies; never sacrifice what clients experience

### 2. Not Adjusting Tax Percentages
- **Mistake:** Using old tax estimates as profits increase
- **Reality:** More profit = higher tax liability
- **Solution:** Recalculate tax needs quarterly

### 3. Planning for High-Income Months
- **Mistake:** Setting expenses based on your best months
- **Reality:** Low-income months leave you strapped
- **Solution:** Base planning on your 3 slowest months

### 4. Setting Unrealistic TAPs Too Early
- **Mistake:** Jumping straight to target percentages
- **Reality:** Creates cash shortfalls and system abandonment
- **Solution:** Start at 1% profit, increase 1-3% per quarter

### 5. Skipping Regular Transfers
- **Mistake:** Being inconsistent with the 10/25 rhythm
- **Reality:** System falls apart without discipline
- **Solution:** Set calendar reminders, automate if possible

### 6. Ignoring Seasonal Fluctuations
- **Mistake:** Same percentages year-round
- **Reality:** Some businesses have predictable highs and lows
- **Solution:** Adjust percentages during slow periods

### 7. Paying Expenses from Wrong Accounts
- **Mistake:** Dipping into Profit or Tax for "emergencies"
- **Reality:** Destroys the behavioral foundation of the system
- **Solution:** Strict separation; let OpEx constraints force innovation

### 8. Failing to Take Profit Distributions
- **Mistake:** Always reinvesting profit back into the business
- **Reality:** No reward = no motivation to continue
- **Solution:** Take 50% distribution quarterly, celebrate

### 9. Thinking It Will Increase Revenue
- **Mistake:** Expecting Profit First to grow sales
- **Reality:** It's a cash management system, not a growth strategy
- **Solution:** Use it alongside (not instead of) growth efforts

### 10. Not Revisiting TAPs
- **Mistake:** Setting percentages once and forgetting
- **Reality:** Business changes; percentages should too
- **Solution:** Quarterly review of CAPs vs TAPs; adjust as needed

## Connection to Other Frameworks

- **The 80/20 Principle:** Find the 20% of expenses that don't serve the business—cut them
