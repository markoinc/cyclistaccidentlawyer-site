    content: `Dooring accidents occur when someone in a parked car opens their door into the path of an oncoming cyclist. These crashes can be devastating, often throwing cyclists into traffic or causing severe injuries from direct impact.

## How Dooring Accidents Happen

Most dooring accidents occur in urban areas where cars park alongside bike lanes or travel lanes. The driver or passenger opens their door without checking for approaching cyclists, giving the rider no time to react.

## Common Injuries from Dooring Accidents

- Broken collarbone (most common cycling injury)
- Traumatic brain injuries
- Facial lacerations and dental damage
- Shoulder dislocations
- Severe road rash

## Who is Liable?

In most cases, the person who opened the door is liable. Many states have specific laws against opening doors into traffic. However, insurance companies may try to argue the cyclist was traveling too fast or should have been watching for doors.

## Preventing Dooring Accidents

**For cyclists:**
- Ride at least 4 feet from parked cars when possible
- Watch for signs of occupancy (brake lights, movement)
- Slow down when passing parked cars

**For drivers:**
- Use the "Dutch Reach" - open the door with your far hand, forcing you to look back
- Check mirrors before opening
- Exit on the curb side when possible

## What To Do After a Dooring Accident

1. Get medical attention immediately
2. Call police and file a report
3. Document the scene with photos
4. Get the driver's insurance information
5. Contact a bicycle accident attorney`

    content: `A right hook accident occurs when a vehicle passes a cyclist and then turns right, cutting across the cyclist's path. These are among the most dangerous and deadly types of bicycle accidents.

## Why Right Hooks Are So Dangerous

- Cyclists have no escape route
- High-speed impact is common
- Large vehicles have significant blind spots
- Often occurs at intersections where cyclists have the right of way

## Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Pass and Turn**
A vehicle passes a cyclist, then immediately turns right at a driveway or intersection, not realizing the cyclist is still alongside.

**Scenario 2: Simultaneous Approach**
Both the vehicle and cyclist approach an intersection. The driver turns right without yielding to the cyclist going straight.

**Scenario 3: Commercial Vehicle Blind Spot**
Trucks and buses have large blind spots on the right side. Drivers simply don't see the cyclist.

## Liability in Right Hook Accidents

Drivers who turn right across a cyclist's path typically bear full liability because:
- The cyclist had the right of way going straight
- Drivers must yield to through traffic before turning
- Passing then immediately turning is negligent

## Prevention Tips

**For Cyclists:**
- Make eye contact with drivers at intersections
- Don't pass trucks or buses on the right
- Take the lane at intersections when safe
- Watch for turn signals (but don't rely on them)
- Assume you're not seen

**For Drivers:**
- Always check mirrors and blind spots before turning
- Don't pass cyclists near intersections
- When in doubt, let the cyclist go first`

## Immediate Steps After a Hit and Run

### 1. Don't Chase the Driver
Focus on your safety. Attempting to follow the vehicle could lead to further injury.

### 2. Call 911 Immediately
Police response time is crucial for:
- Searching for the vehicle
- Canvassing for witnesses
- Accessing traffic cameras

### 3. Document Everything
- Write down any vehicle details you remember (color, make, model, partial plate)
- Note the direction the vehicle fled
- Take photos of your injuries and the scene
- Get names and numbers of any witnesses

### 4. Check for Cameras
Look for:
- Traffic cameras
- Business security cameras
- Doorbell cameras (Ring, Nest)
- Dashcams from other vehicles

## How Drivers Are Found

**Police Investigation**
- Traffic camera footage
- Witness statements
- Matching paint transfers
- Body shop notifications

**Attorney Investigation**
- Private investigators
- Canvassing for additional witnesses
- Social media monitoring
- Reward offers for information

## Compensation Options If Driver Isn't Found

### Uninsured Motorist Coverage
Your own car insurance policy's UM coverage may cover you even when you're on a bicycle. This is often the best source of compensation in hit and run cases.

### MedPay/PIP Coverage
Medical payments coverage can help with immediate medical bills regardless of fault.

### Health Insurance
While not ideal (no pain and suffering coverage), health insurance ensures you get treatment.`

    tags: ["intersection", "accident types", "safety"],
    content: `Over 50% of bicycle accidents occur at intersections. Understanding why these locations are so dangerous can help you stay safe and establish liability if you're injured.

## Why Intersections Are Dangerous

- Multiple traffic movements crossing paths
- Drivers focused on other vehicles, not cyclists
- Limited sight lines
- Confusion about right of way
- Red light runners and stop sign rollers

## Most Dangerous Intersection Types

### 1. Multi-Lane Intersections
More lanes mean more potential conflicts and longer crossing distances.

### 2. Intersections Without Bike Infrastructure
When there's no bike lane or box, cyclists must navigate with cars.

### 3. Right Turn on Red Locations
Drivers checking left for gaps may not see cyclists from the right.

### 4. Freeway On-Ramps
High-speed merging traffic rarely yields to cyclists.

## Common Intersection Crash Types

**Left Cross**
A vehicle turning left fails to yield to an oncoming cyclist going straight.

**Right Hook**
A vehicle turning right cuts across a cyclist's path.

**Red Light Violation**
A driver or cyclist runs the red light.

**Failure to Yield**
Driver enters intersection without yielding to cyclist with right of way.

## Liability at Intersections

Generally, the party violating traffic laws is liable:
- Running red lights or stop signs
- Failing to yield to through traffic
- Making improper turns
- Speeding through intersections

## Safe Intersection Navigation

1. **Make eye contact** with drivers
2. **Take the lane** to prevent right hooks
3. **Don't pass on the right** at intersections
4. **Assume you're invisible** and ride defensively
5. **Use lights** even during the day`

## Common Bike Lane Violations

### Parking in Bike Lanes
Delivery trucks, Ubers, and private vehicles illegally parking force cyclists into traffic.

### Driving in Bike Lanes
Vehicles using bike lanes to pass traffic or make turns.

### Crossing Without Yielding
Vehicles crossing bike lanes without yielding to cyclists.

### Opening Doors Into Bike Lanes
Occupants of vehicles parked adjacent to bike lanes opening doors without looking.

## Types of Bike Lanes

**Class I: Bike Path**
Completely separate from vehicle traffic.

**Class II: Bike Lane**
Painted lane on roadway, often with buffer.

**Class III: Bike Route**
Shared lane with sharrows or signs.

**Protected Bike Lane**
Physical barrier separates bikes from traffic.

## Legal Protections

Most states and cities have laws that:
- Prohibit parking in bike lanes
- Prohibit driving in bike lanes except to turn
- Require yielding when crossing bike lanes
- Set fines for violations

## Documenting Bike Lane Violations

1. Photo of the violation
2. License plate number
3. Time and location
4. Names of witnesses

    content: `Rear-end collisions with cyclists often result in the most severe injuries because there's no warning and no way to brace for impact. These accidents are almost always the driver's fault.

## Why Rear-End Crashes Are So Severe

- Speed differential (car at 40mph vs. bike at 15mph)
- No warning to the cyclist
- Cyclist is thrown forward, often into traffic
- Vehicle weight vs. unprotected human body

## Common Causes

### Distracted Driving
Texting, phone use, eating, or adjusting GPS.

### Impaired Driving
Alcohol, drugs, or fatigue.

### Speeding
Higher speeds mean less time to react.

### Poor Visibility
Dawn, dusk, night, or bad weather conditions.

### Following Too Closely
Not leaving enough space to stop.

## Liability Is Usually Clear

In rear-end collisions, the following driver is almost always liable because:
- Every driver must maintain a safe following distance
- Drivers must be able to stop for obstructions
- Rear-ending someone is prima facie negligence

### Insurance Company Arguments

Despite clear liability, insurers may argue:
- Cyclist had no lights (night accidents)
- Cyclist was on a road where bikes aren't permitted
- Cyclist stopped suddenly without reason

## Safety Tips

1. Always use rear lights, even during day
2. Wear bright, reflective clothing
3. Avoid roads without shoulders when possible
4. Use a rear-view mirror
5. Listen for traffic (earbuds can be deadly)`

    content: `Bicycle accidents involving commercial vehicles—trucks, buses, delivery vehicles—are disproportionately likely to result in fatal or catastrophic injuries. Understanding the unique dangers is essential for safety and liability.

## Why Commercial Vehicle Accidents Are So Dangerous

- Massive weight differential (80,000 lbs vs. 200 lbs)
- Large blind spots on all sides
- Long stopping distances
- Drivers under time pressure
- Right turns across bike lanes

## Commercial Vehicle Blind Spots

**Front:** Up to 20 feet directly ahead
**Rear:** Up to 200 feet behind
**Right Side:** Two lanes wide (the "kill zone")
**Left Side:** One lane wide

### The "No Zone"
If you can't see the driver's mirrors, they can't see you. Never ride in a truck's blind spots.

## Common Accident Scenarios

### Right Turn Squeeze
Truck turns right at intersection, crushing cyclist between truck and curb.

### Rear Underride
Cyclist rear-ends or is rear-ended by truck and goes under.

### Mirror/Cab Strike
Cyclist is struck by extending mirrors or cab during pass.

### Door Strike
Delivery truck door opens into cyclist's path.

## Multiple Liable Parties

Commercial vehicle accidents often involve multiple defendants:
- **Driver** - direct negligence
- **Trucking Company** - vicarious liability, negligent hiring
- **Vehicle Owner** - if different from operator
- **Shipper** - if cargo issues contributed
- **Manufacturer** - if vehicle defect involved

## Higher Insurance Limits

Commercial vehicles typically carry $750,000 to $1 million+ in liability coverage, meaning adequate compensation is more likely available than with personal vehicles.`

**Criminal Case**
- Prosecuted by the state
- Driver faces jail time, fines, license suspension
- You're a witness, not a party

**Civil Case**
- Your personal injury lawsuit
- Seeks compensation for damages
- Independent of criminal outcome

### The criminal case doesn't pay your bills—your civil claim does.

## Proving Drunk Driving in Civil Court

- Police reports and arrest records
- Blood alcohol test results
- Witness testimony
- Bar or restaurant records
- Criminal conviction (if obtained)

## Damages Available

### Compensatory Damages
- Medical expenses
- Lost wages
- Pain and suffering
- Loss of enjoyment of life
- Permanent disability

### Punitive Damages
Many states allow punitive (punishment) damages in drunk driving cases because:
- Drunk driving is willful misconduct
- Serves to punish and deter
- Can significantly increase recovery

## Dram Shop Laws

In some states, you can also sue:
- Bars that over-served the driver
- Social hosts who served alcohol
- Restaurants or event venues

## Time Sensitivity

Act quickly because:
- BAC evidence must be preserved
- Witness memories fade
- Criminal cases move fast

It's the legal deadline for filing a lawsuit, starting from the date of your accident. Different states have different deadlines, ranging from 1 to 6 years.

## State-by-State Breakdown

### 1 Year
- Kentucky
- Louisiana  
- Tennessee

### 2 Years
- Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia

    content: `How much compensation you can recover often depends on whether you share any fault for the accident. Your state's negligence system determines how partial fault affects your case.

## Contributory Negligence States

**States:** Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington D.C.

### The Harsh Rule
If you're found even 1% at fault, you recover NOTHING.

### Example
A cyclist runs a stop sign and is hit by a speeding driver. Even though the driver was speeding, the cyclist's violation could bar all recovery.

### Why It's Devastating
Insurance companies in these states aggressively argue any fault to avoid paying anything.

## Pure Comparative Negligence States

**States:** Including California, New York, Florida, and about 10 others.

### The Fair Rule
Your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault, but you can always recover something.

### Example
You're 30% at fault for $100,000 in damages. You recover $70,000.

## Modified Comparative Negligence States

**Most states follow this system.**

### 50% Bar Rule
You can recover if you're less than 50% at fault.

### 51% Bar Rule  
You can recover if you're 50% or less at fault.

### Example
At 49% fault with $100,000 damages, you recover $51,000.
At 51% fault, you recover nothing under the 51% bar rule.

## How Fault Is Determined

Factors insurance companies and juries consider:
- Traffic law violations
- Helmet use (in some states)
- Visibility and lighting
- Road position
- Speed
- Impairment
- Distraction

## Protecting Yourself

1. Follow all traffic laws
2. Use lights and reflectors
3. Wear visible clothing
4. Don't admit any fault at the scene
5. Get witness contact information`

### Wrongful Death
**Range:** $500,000 - $10,000,000+
**Factors:** Age of deceased, earnings, dependents, circumstances

## Factors Affecting Settlement Value

### Liability Clarity
Clear liability = higher settlement. Disputed fault = lower.

### Injury Severity
More severe injuries justify higher compensation.

### Medical Documentation
Well-documented treatment supports your claim.

### Insurance Coverage
Can't get more than available coverage (usually).

### Your Credibility
Juries and adjusters assess believability.

### Jurisdiction
Some areas have higher verdict averages.

### Attorney Quality
Experienced attorneys often achieve better results.

## Why You Shouldn't Compare Cases

Every accident is unique:
- Different injuries
- Different treatment
- Different insurance limits
- Different local laws
- Different juries

Your case value depends on YOUR specific circumstances.`

    content: `Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death in bicycle accidents. Even with a helmet, the forces involved in a collision can cause devastating brain damage.

## Types of Traumatic Brain Injury

### Concussion (Mild TBI)
- Brief loss of consciousness or none
- Temporary confusion
- Headache, dizziness
- Usually recovers within weeks

### Moderate TBI
- Loss of consciousness for minutes to hours
- Persistent confusion
- Physical, cognitive, behavioral changes
- May have lasting effects

### Severe TBI
- Extended unconsciousness or coma
- Significant brain damage
- Life-altering disabilities
- May be permanent

## Symptoms to Watch For

**Immediate:**
- Loss of consciousness
- Confusion or disorientation
- Headache
- Nausea/vomiting
- Dizziness

**Days/Weeks Later:**
- Memory problems
- Difficulty concentrating
- Mood changes
- Sleep disturbances
- Sensitivity to light/sound
- Personality changes

## The Helmet Debate

Helmets reduce severe brain injury risk by about 50%, but:
- They don't prevent all TBI
- Rotational forces still cause damage
- Insurance companies unfairly blame unhelmeted cyclists

### Important: Not wearing a helmet doesn't make the accident your fault.

## TBI Case Values

TBI cases often have higher values because:
- Long-term medical care needs
- Lost earning capacity
- Life care planning required
- Significant pain and suffering
- Impact on relationships and enjoyment of life

## Proving TBI Damages

- Neurological testing
- Brain imaging (MRI, CT, PET)

## States with No Helmet Laws

About 23 states have no statewide bicycle helmet requirements:
- Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming
- Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada
- Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma
- Arkansas, Mississippi, Iowa
- Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana
- Kentucky, South Carolina
- Vermont, New Hampshire

### Local Laws May Apply
Many cities and counties have helmet laws even when the state doesn't.

## States with Youth Helmet Laws

Most states require helmets for riders under a certain age:
- **Under 16:** California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee
- **Under 18:** Alabama, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, West Virginia
- **Under 12:** Louisiana

## How Helmet Use Affects Your Case

### If You Weren't Wearing a Helmet

**In states with no requirement:**
Generally, helmet use can't be used against you. The driver is still responsible for the accident.

**In states with requirements:**
If you violated the law, insurance companies may argue:
- Contributory negligence
- Your injuries would be less severe

**Reality:**
Even in no-requirement states, insurers try to reduce compensation by blaming unhelmeted cyclists for head injuries.

### If You Were Wearing a Helmet

Wearing a helmet:
- Shows you were being responsible
- Undermines any negligence argument
- May increase credibility with juries

## The Bottom Line

Wear a helmet regardless of legal requirements. But don't let insurance companies blame you for an accident that wasn't your fault.`

### 5 Feet
- New Mexico (when speed >35mph)

### "Safe Distance" (Not Specified)
Some states require a "safe distance" without specifying feet:
- Iowa
- Massachusetts
- Oregon (3ft minimum recommended)

## How Safe Passing Laws Help Your Case

When a driver passes too closely and causes an accident:

### Negligence Per Se
Violating the safe passing law is automatic negligence in many states.

### Clear Liability
Traffic code violation strongly supports your case.

### Supporting Evidence
- Witness testimony on close pass
- Damage pattern on bike
- Camera footage

## Problems with Safe Passing Laws

### Enforcement
- Rarely enforced
- Difficult to prove exact distance
- Police often don't witness violations

### Driver Awareness
- Many drivers don't know the law
- Underestimate 3 feet
- Impatient on narrow roads`

## Legal Requirements

Most states require:
- **Front white light** visible from 500+ feet
- **Rear red reflector** visible from 300+ feet
- May require reflectors on wheels/pedals

## Beyond the Minimum

### Lights

**Front Light**
- Minimum 200 lumens for urban
- 500+ lumens for rural/unlit roads
- Steady mode for being seen, flash for attention

**Rear Light**
- Red color required
- 50+ lumens
- Flash mode increases visibility
- Consider multiple lights

**Side Visibility**
- Spoke lights or reflectors
- Pedal reflectors
- Frame-mounted side lights

### Clothing

**Colors**
- Fluorescent yellow-green most visible in daylight
- White and orange also effective
- Avoid dark colors, especially at night

**Reflective Material**
- Moving reflective elements (ankles, shoes) catch attention
- Reflective vest or jacket
- Reflective tape on bike and helmet

### When to Use Lights

**Always use lights:**
- Dawn and dusk (most dangerous times)
- Cloudy or overcast days
- In shadows (tree cover, buildings)
- Anytime visibility is reduced

**Daytime running lights**
Studies show daytime lights reduce accidents by 19-33%

## Visibility and Your Legal Case

### If You Were Visible
Undermines "I didn't see them" defense.

### If Visibility Was Poor
Insurance companies will argue you contributed to the accident. However:
- Driver still had duty to watch for road users
- Poor visibility doesn't excuse hitting someone
- You can still recover (reduced in comparative negligence states)`

### Dooring Zone
- Ride at least 4 feet from parked cars
- Watch for occupants and brake lights
- Take the lane if bike lane is in dooring zone

### Intersections
- 50%+ of urban cycling accidents happen here
- Take the lane to prevent right hooks
- Make eye contact with drivers
- Don't pass trucks or buses on the right

### Pedestrians
- They often don't see or hear cyclists
- Always yield even when you have right of way
- Slow down in pedestrian-heavy areas

### Public Transit
- Buses stopping and pulling out
- Light rail and streetcar tracks (cross at angle)
- Rideshare pickups/dropoffs

### Delivery Vehicles
- Frequently stop in bike lanes
- Drivers exit quickly without looking
- Plan escape route when passing

## Safe Urban Riding Techniques

### Lane Positioning
**"Taking the lane"** is safer than riding in the gutter because:
- You're more visible
- Prevents unsafe passes
- Avoids debris and drainage grates
- Prevents right hooks

### Predictability
- Signal all turns and stops
- Ride in a straight line
- Don't weave between cars

### Defensive Riding
- Assume you're invisible
- Cover brakes at intersections
- Have an escape route planned
- Make eye contact before proceeding

### Speed Management
- Slower speeds = more reaction time
- Match traffic flow when safe
- Slow significantly at intersections`

## Know Your Enemy

Insurance adjusters are trained to:
- Get you to admit fault
- Minimize your injuries
- Record statements to use against you
- Settle quickly for less than you deserve
- Find reasons to deny claims

## Common Insurance Company Tactics

### The Quick Settlement Offer
An early offer before you know your full damages. Never accept this.

### The Recorded Statement Request
"Just a few questions for our file." Anything you say can be used to deny or reduce your claim.

### Delaying
Hoping you'll get desperate and accept less.

### Requesting Unnecessary Records
Fishing for pre-existing conditions or anything to blame you.

### Disputing Medical Treatment
"You didn't need that MRI." Second-guessing your doctors.

### Surveillance
They may watch you to catch you doing something inconsistent with your injuries.

## How to Protect Yourself

### Don't Give Recorded Statements
"I'm not comfortable giving a statement without consulting an attorney."

### Don't Sign Medical Authorizations
They'll use broad authorizations to access your entire medical history.

### Don't Accept Quick Offers
You have the statute of limitations—use the time to understand your damages.

### Document Everything
Keep a file with all correspondence, bills, and notes.

### Get an Attorney
Insurance companies pay represented claimants more because:
- Attorneys know case values
- Attorneys can go to trial
- Attorneys prevent mistakes

## Your Own Insurance Company

Even your own insurer isn't necessarily on your side:
- They don't want to pay UM/UIM claims

    content: `Here's something many cyclists don't know: your auto insurance policy's uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage often protects you even when you're on a bicycle.

## What is UM/UIM Coverage?

**Uninsured Motorist (UM):** Covers you when hit by a driver with no insurance.

**Underinsured Motorist (UIM):** Covers the gap when the driver's insurance isn't enough.

## How It Applies to Cyclists

Most UM/UIM policies cover the named insured:
- While driving
- As a passenger
- **As a pedestrian or cyclist**

### Check Your Policy
Look for language like "occupying any motor vehicle" vs. "arising out of use of a motor vehicle."

## When UM/UIM Coverage Helps

### Hit and Run
Driver never identified = uninsured driver.

### Driver Has No Insurance
About 13% of drivers nationally are uninsured.

### Driver Has Minimum Limits
$25,000 doesn't cover serious bicycle accident injuries.

### Example
You're hit by a driver with $25,000 coverage. Your injuries are worth $200,000. You collect $25,000 from driver's policy, then $175,000 from your UM/UIM (up to your limit).

## How to Use UM/UIM Coverage

1. Report the accident to your insurer
2. File claim against at-fault driver
3. After settling/litigating that claim, file UM/UIM claim
4. Your insurer steps into driver's shoes

## Tips

- Check your UM/UIM limits NOW
- Consider increasing coverage (it's cheap)
- If you don't own a car, you may still be covered under:
  - Household member's policy
  - Named non-owner policy`

- Your own insurance pays initial medical bills (up to $50,000)
- You can sue for additional damages if you meet "serious injury" threshold

## New York City Specific

### Vision Zero
NYC's program to eliminate traffic deaths has improved but not eliminated cycling dangers.

### Protected Bike Lanes
Growing network, but gaps remain.

### Common NYC Accidents
- Dooring on avenues
- Right hooks from trucks
- Delivery vehicle conflicts
- Pedestrian collisions

## Dangerous Areas

1. Manhattan (especially Midtown)
2. Brooklyn (Atlantic Avenue corridor)
3. Queens (major boulevards)
4. Long Island suburbs
5. Upstate college towns`

    content: `Vulnerable Road User (VRU) laws create enhanced penalties for drivers who injure or kill cyclists, pedestrians, and others who share the road without the protection of a vehicle.

## What Are Vulnerable Road Users?

Typically includes:
- Cyclists
- Pedestrians
- Motorcyclists
- Scooter riders
- People in wheelchairs
- Road workers

## How VRU Laws Help

### Criminal Penalties
Drivers who carelessly injure VRUs face:
- Higher fines
- Mandatory community service
- License suspension
- Traffic school requirements

### Civil Impact
VRU law violations can support:
- Negligence per se claims
- Higher damage awards
- Punitive damages arguments

## States with VRU Laws

Over 30 states have some form of VRU protection, including:
- Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut
- Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois
- Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada
- New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Utah
- Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin

## What VRU Laws Don't Do

Most VRU laws don't:
- Create automatic civil liability
- Guarantee criminal prosecution
- Prevent accidents

### They're deterrents and support for civil claims, not silver bullets.

## Advocating for Better Laws

If your state lacks VRU protections:
- Contact your state legislators
- Work with cycling advocacy groups
- Support Vision Zero initiatives`

    readTime: "5 min",
    tags: ["Idaho stop", "traffic laws", "safety"],
    content: `The "Idaho Stop" allows cyclists to treat stop signs as yields and red lights as stop signs. Despite sounding dangerous, studies show it's actually safer.

## What Is the Idaho Stop?

**Stop Signs → Yield Signs**
Cyclists slow, check for traffic, and proceed if clear without fully stopping.

**Red Lights → Stop Signs**
Cyclists stop, check for traffic, and proceed if clear (in some versions).

## Why It's Called the Idaho Stop

Idaho passed the first such law in 1982. It remained unique for decades until other states started following.

## States with Idaho Stop Laws

Full or partial adoption:
- Idaho (1982 - original)
- Delaware (2017)
- Arkansas (2019)
- Oregon (2020)
- Washington (2020)
- North Dakota (2021)
- Oklahoma (2021)
- Colorado (2022 - local option)
- Several others pending

## Why It's Actually Safer

### Physics
- Cyclists need more energy to restart from a stop
- Starting from a stop puts cyclists in intersection longer
- Rolling allows continuous observation

### Visibility
- Moving cyclist is more visible
- Gets cyclist through intersection faster

### Research
Delaware study showed 23% decrease in cycling injuries after adoption.

## Why Some Oppose It

- "Rules should be the same for everyone"
- Perceived as special treatment
- Confusion for drivers
- Enforcement challenges

## If Your State Doesn't Have It

You still must follow current traffic laws. Running stop signs can:
- Result in tickets
- Create liability if you're in an accident
- Give insurance companies ammunition against your claim`

## E-Bike Classifications

### Class 1
- Pedal-assist only (no throttle)
- Motor assists up to 20 mph
- Allowed on most bike paths and lanes

### Class 2
- Has throttle
- Motor can propel bike up to 20 mph
- More restrictions on paths

### Class 3
- Pedal-assist up to 28 mph
- Often restricted from bike paths
- May require helmet (age varies)

## State Laws Vary Widely

### Most States
Have adopted the 3-class system with similar rules.

### Some States
- Treat e-bikes as mopeds or motorcycles
- Require registration or licensing
- Prohibit on certain roads

### Check Your State
Laws are changing rapidly as e-bikes proliferate.

## E-Bike Accident Issues

### Speed
Higher speeds mean more severe injuries.

### Weight
E-bikes are heavier, harder to control.

### Inexperience
Many e-bike riders are new to cycling.

### Infrastructure
Bike lanes designed for 15 mph, not 28 mph.

### Driver Expectations
Drivers don't expect bikes moving at 25+ mph.

## Liability in E-Bike Accidents

Same principles as regular bikes:
- Driver negligence
- Comparative fault analysis
- Insurance coverage applies

### Additional Considerations
- Product liability if bike malfunctioned
- Manufacturer defects (battery fires, brake failures)

## E-Bike Accident Claims

E-bike cases can be worth more because:
- Higher speeds = more severe injuries
- Product liability potential
- Higher insurance limits may apply (if treated as motorized vehicle)`

    content: `A left cross accident occurs when a vehicle turns left into the path of an oncoming cyclist. These high-speed collisions often result in severe injuries.

## How Left Cross Accidents Happen

The driver turns left at an intersection or driveway without yielding to an oncoming cyclist traveling straight. Common scenarios:

- Driver doesn't see cyclist due to sun glare
- Driver misjudges cyclist's speed
- Driver is focused on car traffic, not bikes
- Cyclist is in driver's blind spot

## Why They're So Dangerous

- Head-on or T-bone impact
- High combined speed
- Cyclist has no time to react
- Often occurs at higher-speed roads

## Liability

Drivers turning left must yield to oncoming traffic, including cyclists. The turning driver is typically fully liable unless:

- Cyclist ran red light
- Cyclist was on wrong side of road
- Other unusual circumstances

## Prevention

**For Cyclists:**
- Make eye contact with waiting drivers
- Assume they don't see you
- Cover brakes approaching intersections
- Don't pass cars on the right at intersections

**For Drivers:**
- Look for cyclists, not just cars
- Don't assume clear path
- Wait for full visibility`

## Types of Sideswipe Accidents

**Mirror Strike:** Vehicle's side mirror hits cyclist
**Body Contact:** Vehicle body contacts cyclist
**Air Disturbance:** Large trucks create wind that destabilizes cyclists

## Injuries from Sideswipes

- Loss of control leading to falls
- Striking the vehicle
- Being thrown into traffic
- Running off the road

## Proving Sideswipe Cases

Challenges include:
- Driver may not realize they hit cyclist
- No damage to vehicle
- He-said-she-said disputes

Evidence that helps:
- Witness testimony
- Security camera footage
- Mirror or paint transfer
- GPS/fitness tracker data

## Safe Passing Law Violations

Most states require 3+ feet when passing. A sideswipe is automatic proof of violation.

## Prevention

- Use rear-view mirror
- Ride predictably
- Take the lane when narrow
- Wear bright colors`

## Why Cyclists Salmon

- Feels safer to see oncoming cars
- Seems like shorter route
- Avoiding certain intersections
- Not understanding traffic laws

## Why It's So Dangerous

### Closing Speed
A cyclist at 15 mph + car at 35 mph = 50 mph closing speed. Same direction = only 20 mph speed differential.

### Driver Expectations
Drivers look for traffic going the correct direction. They don't expect bikes coming toward them.

### Intersection Danger
Drivers turning right look left for traffic. A salmon cyclist comes from the right—unseen.

### Statistics
Wrong-way riding is involved in 25% of car-bike collisions.

## Legal Consequences

### Traffic Violation
Most states require riding with traffic flow.

### Liability Impact
If salmoning contributes to accident:
- May be found partially at fault
- In contributory negligence states, could bar all recovery
- Reduces settlement value`

## Is Sidewalk Cycling Legal?

**State Laws Vary:**
- Some states allow it everywhere
- Some prohibit it in business districts
- Some leave it to local ordinances
- Some require yielding to pedestrians

**Check Local Laws:**
City ordinances often differ from state law.

## Why Sidewalks Are Actually Dangerous

### Driveway Crossings
Drivers pulling out look for pedestrians, not fast-moving cyclists. This is the #1 sidewalk cycling danger.

### Pedestrian Conflicts
Cyclists and pedestrians don't mix well. Speed differential creates collisions.

### Intersection Invisibility
Drivers making turns don't expect bikes from sidewalks.

### Poor Surface Conditions
Sidewalks have more cracks, bumps, and debris.

## Liability Issues

### Hitting a Pedestrian
If you hit a pedestrian while sidewalk cycling, you may be liable for their injuries.

### Being Hit by a Car
If sidewalk cycling is illegal, insurance companies may argue you were partially at fault.

## When Sidewalk Riding Makes Sense

- Very slow speeds
- No safe road alternative
- Accompanying small children
- Where explicitly permitted`

Children under 7 are generally incapable of negligence.

### Children 7-14
Held to standard of reasonable child of similar age, experience, and intelligence.

### Children 14+
Some states treat as adults; others maintain child standard.

## Comparative Fault and Children

In comparative negligence states, a child's fault is judged against what's reasonable for their age, not adult standards.

## Driver Duties to Children

Drivers must exercise extra caution around children because:
- Children are unpredictable
- Children don't understand traffic rules
- Children may dart into traffic

Failure to slow near playgrounds, schools, or visible children can establish negligence.

## Special Damages

### Future Medical Care
Lifetime of treatment for permanent injuries.

### Future Lost Earnings

### Physical Vulnerability
- Bones break more easily
- Longer recovery times
- Higher complication rates
- Greater fatality risk from same injuries

### Reaction Time
- Slower to avoid hazards
- Balance issues more common
- Vision and hearing changes

### Cycling Habits
- More likely to ride during daytime
- Often ride slower
- May be less familiar with current traffic patterns

## Common Injuries

- Hip fractures (especially dangerous)
- Traumatic brain injury
- Spinal injuries
- Internal bleeding

## Legal Considerations

### Higher Damages
Severe injuries justify higher compensation. Insurance companies may dispute life expectancy, but serious injuries are compensable regardless of age.

### Pre-Existing Conditions
Insurers blame pre-existing conditions. The "eggshell plaintiff" doctrine says you take victims as you find them.

### Lost Earnings
Even retired individuals may have wage claims:
- Part-time work
- Consulting

    content: `Many cyclists wonder: can you get a DUI on a bicycle? The answer varies by state, but intoxication while cycling is always dangerous and can affect accident claims.

## DUI Laws for Bicycles

### States Where Bikes Are "Vehicles"
In states where DUI laws apply to "vehicles" and bicycles are defined as vehicles, you can be charged with cycling under the influence.
Examples: California, Colorado, Oregon

### States with Specific Exclusions
Some states explicitly exclude bicycles from DUI laws.
Examples: New York, Texas

### Public Intoxication
Even where cycling DUI doesn't apply, public intoxication charges may.

## Impact on Accident Claims

### Comparative Fault
If you were intoxicated when hit by a car, insurance companies will argue:
- Your impairment contributed to accident
- You couldn't react appropriately
- Percentage reduction in damages

### Doesn't Excuse Driver Negligence
Driver is still responsible for their negligence. Your intoxication doesn't give them a pass.

## Safety Concerns

Intoxicated cyclists face:
- Impaired balance
- Slowed reaction times
- Poor judgment
- Reduced coordination
- Increased injury severity

## The Statistics

Approximately 20% of cyclist fatalities involve intoxicated cyclists. This doesn't make the drivers less responsible, but it shows the increased danger.

## Best Practices

- Don't ride impaired
- Arrange alternative transportation
- If you must ride, use well-lit paths
- Wear helmet and lights`

### Certainty
You know exactly what you're getting.

### Speed
Settlements resolve in months; trials can take years.

### Privacy
Settlement terms can remain confidential.

### Lower Costs
No trial preparation, expert witness fees, or appeal risk.

### Emotional Closure
Avoid the stress of testifying.

## Trial Advantages

### Potentially Higher Recovery
Juries sometimes award more than settlement offers.

### Justice
Public accountability for the defendant.

### Precedent
Trial outcomes can influence future cases.

### When Settlement Offers Are Too Low
Sometimes trial is the only path to fair compensation.

## When Settlement Makes Sense

- Liability is disputed
- Your damages are moderate
- You need money quickly
- Strong risk factors for trial
- Defendant has limited assets/coverage

## When Trial May Be Necessary

- Insulting settlement offers
- Clear liability and strong damages
- Egregious defendant conduct (drunk driving)
- Policy limit cases where insurer won't budge
- Defendant refuses reasonable settlement

## The Decision

Your attorney will advise based on:

### The Record
Appellate court reviews only what happened at trial.

### Briefs
Written arguments from both sides.

### Oral Argument
Sometimes permitted, but not always.

### Decision
Affirm, reverse, or remand for new trial.

## Success Rates

Appeals rarely succeed because:
- Standard of review favors trial court
- Errors must be "prejudicial"
- Harmless errors don't warrant reversal

## When to Appeal

Appeal may make sense when:
- Clear legal error occurred
- Error affected outcome
- Stakes justify cost
- Good precedent issues

## The Statistics

- Only 25% of cycling occurs at night
- But 50%+ of fatal crashes happen then
- Risk per mile is 8x higher at night

## Legal Requirements

Most states require:
- **Front:** White light visible from 500 feet
- **Rear:** Red reflector visible from 300+ feet
- Some require rear light in addition to reflector

### Check Your State
Requirements vary. Know the minimum.

## Best Practices (Beyond Minimums)

### Front Light
- 500+ lumens for unlit roads
- 200+ lumens for lit streets
- Angled slightly down to not blind others

### Rear Light
- Red, flashing mode
- 50+ lumens
- Multiple lights for redundancy

### Reflectives
- Ankle bands (motion catches attention)
- Reflective vest or jacket
- Tape on bike frame and wheels

## Liability Issues

### If You Were Hit Without Lights
Insurance companies will argue contributory negligence. However:
- Driver still had duty to watch for obstacles
- Headlights should reveal cyclists
- Any light impairment goes to degree, not total bar

### If Driver's Lights Were Defective
Defective headlights can support your claim.

## Night Cycling Safety Tips

1. Use more light than legally required
2. Assume you're invisible
3. Choose well-lit routes
4. Wear bright/reflective clothing
5. Make eye contact at intersections
6. Ride defensively`

### Reduced Visibility
- Rain on driver windshields
- Spray from other vehicles
- Fogged glasses
- Darker conditions

### Slippery Surfaces
- Painted lines become ice-like
- Metal (grates, tracks) extremely slick
- Oil and debris wash onto roads
- Leaves become hazardous

### Stopping Distance
- Wet brakes work poorly (especially rim brakes)
- Tires have less grip
- Longer stopping distances for cyclists and cars

## Liability in Rain Accidents

### Driver Duties in Rain
Drivers must adjust for conditions:
- Reduce speed
- Increase following distance
- Use lights and wipers
- Exercise extra caution

Failure to adjust is negligence.

### Cyclist Duties
Cyclists should also adjust:
- Ride more cautiously
- Increase visibility
- Brake earlier
- Avoid slick surfaces

### Comparative Fault
If cyclist was riding recklessly in rain, some fault may be assigned. But driver who hits cyclist is still primarily responsible.

## Rain Cycling Safety

1. Increase visibility (lights on, bright clothing)
2. Avoid painted lines and metal
3. Brake early and gradually
4. Reduce speed significantly

Driver was negligent, but road defect contributed.

### Driver + Employer
Employee driver acting within employment.

### Driver + Product Manufacturer
Vehicle defect and driver negligence combined.

### Driver + Property Owner

## Joint and Several Liability

In many states, multiple defendants can be held jointly and severally liable:
- Each is responsible for full damages
- You collect from whoever can pay
- Defendants sort out shares among themselves

Some states have modified this rule, making each defendant responsible only for their share.

## Strategic Considerations

### Naming All Defendants
- Identifies all insurance policies
- Prevents blame-shifting
- Maximizes potential recovery

### Settlement Issues
- One defendant may settle early
- Settlement may affect claims against others
- Set-offs and credits apply

### Apportioning Fault
Insurance companies and juries assign percentages:
- Driver A: 60%
- Driver B: 30%
- Cyclist: 10%

Your recovery is reduced by your percentage.

- Don't post physical activities
- Don't post about your case
- Don't friend or follow defendant

### Don't Delete

- Subpoenas can reach private content
- Friends may screenshot and share
- Privacy isn't absolute

    content: `Insurance companies often request "Independent Medical Exams" (IMEs). These exams aren't independent—they're defense tools designed to minimize your injuries.

## What Is an IME?

An examination by a doctor chosen by the insurance company or defendant to evaluate your injuries.

## Why They Request IMEs

- Challenge your treatment
- Dispute injury severity
- Claim you've recovered
- Argue pre-existing conditions
- Find reasons to reduce payment

## Can You Refuse?

### Before Lawsuit
Generally, you can refuse.

### During Lawsuit
Usually required if defendant requests it. Refusing can result in case dismissal.

## The IME Doctor

### "Independent"?
These doctors:
- Are paid by insurance companies
- Do IMEs for a living
- Rarely find in favor of patients
- Never treat you

### Their Goal
Find reasons to minimize your claim.

## Preparing for an IME

### Before
- Review your medical history
- Know your symptoms and limitations
- Bring your attorney (to wait outside)
- Don't exaggerate or minimize

### During
- Be honest and consistent
- Don't volunteer extra information
- Report all symptoms
- Don't let them rush you

### After
- Document what happened
- Note any strange comments
- Tell your attorney immediately

## Your Attorney's Role

Your attorney can:
- Object to IME scope
- Request copy of IME report
- Depose the IME doctor
- Get your own expert to rebut`

    content: `Understanding the insurance claims process helps you navigate it effectively. Here's what to expect from start to finish.

## Step 1: Report the Accident

### To Driver's Insurance
- Call their insurance company
- Provide basic facts only
- Don't give recorded statement without attorney

### To Your Insurance
- Report promptly as required by policy
- UM/UIM and MedPay claims
- May affect your rates (but coverage helps)

## Step 2: Initial Investigation

The insurance company will:
- Take statements (be cautious)
- Review police report
- Assess liability
- Send adjuster if needed

## Step 3: Medical Treatment

- Complete your treatment
- Reach Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI)
- Gather all medical records
- Track all expenses

## Step 4: Demand Package

You or your attorney sends:
- Liability analysis
- Medical records and bills
- Lost wage documentation
- Pain and suffering narrative

## Step 5: Negotiation

Insurance company responds (usually low).

Negotiation follows:
- Counter-offers
- Supporting arguments
- Mediation (sometimes)

## Step 6: Resolution

### Settlement
- Agree on amount
- Sign release
- Receive payment (weeks)

### Litigation
- File lawsuit if no agreement
- Discovery and trial process
- Potential settlement during litigation

## Timeline

- Simple cases: 3-6 months

## Working with an Adjuster

Remember:
- They work for insurance company
- Their goal is paying less
- Be polite but cautious
- Document all communications`

    content: `When you recover compensation for a bicycle accident, your health insurer or medical providers may be entitled to repayment. These claims are called liens.

## Types of Liens

### Health Insurance Liens
If your health insurer paid for accident-related treatment, they may have a right to reimbursement from your settlement.

### Medicare/Medicaid Liens
Federal and state programs have strong reimbursement rights.

### Hospital Liens
Many states allow hospitals to place liens for unpaid treatment.

### Provider Liens
Doctors who treated you may have contractual liens.

### ERISA Plans
Employer health plans often have strict reimbursement provisions.

## How Liens Affect Your Settlement

Example:
- Settlement: $100,000
- Attorney fees: $33,333
- Costs: $5,000
- Health insurance lien: $25,000
- Net to you: $36,667

## Lien Negotiation

Your attorney can often reduce liens:
- Common Fund Doctrine (lien shares attorney fee cost)
- Made-Whole Doctrine (full compensation required first)
- Medicaid/Medicare regulations
- State law limitations
- Direct negotiation

## Subrogation

Subrogation is the insurer's right to step into your shoes and pursue recovery from the at-fault party. This differs from a lien but has similar effects.

## Protecting Your Recovery

- Disclose all potential liens to your attorney
- Don't ignore lien notices
- Negotiate before settling
- Understand your health policy's terms
- Factor liens into settlement decisions`

    content: `Rideshare vehicles are everywhere—and they're often distracted by their apps. When Uber or Lyft drivers hit cyclists, unique insurance issues arise.

## Rideshare Insurance Periods

### Period 0
App off. Only driver's personal insurance applies.

### Period 1
App on, waiting for request. Limited rideshare coverage:
- $50,000 bodily injury per person
- $100,000 per accident

### Period 2
En route to pickup. Full rideshare coverage:
- $1 million liability

### Period 3
Passenger in vehicle. Same full coverage.

## Determining Which Period

Critical evidence:
- Was driver's app on?
- Were they on a ride?
- App records prove status

## Insurance Complications

### Multiple Policies
- Driver's personal insurance
- Rideshare company insurance
- Your UM/UIM coverage

### Policy Gaps
Personal policies often exclude commercial driving, creating gaps in Period 1.

### Rideshare Companies Fight
They argue driver was independent contractor, not their responsibility.

## Your Claim

You can potentially recover from:
- Driver directly
- Driver's personal insurance
- Rideshare company insurance
- Your own UM/UIM

## Proving Rideshare Status

- Subpoena app records
- Driver's phone forensics
- Witness testimony
- Dashcam footage`

## Types of Cycling Infrastructure

### Protected Bike Lanes
Physical barrier separates bikes from traffic. Reduces severe injury by 90%.

### Buffered Bike Lanes
Painted buffer provides space but no physical protection.

### Standard Bike Lanes
Simple painted lane. Better than nothing, but limited protection.

### Shared Lane Markings (Sharrows)
Indicate cyclists may use lane. Controversial effectiveness.

### Multi-Use Paths
Off-street paths shared with pedestrians.

### Cycle Tracks
Bidirectional protected lanes, typically at sidewalk level.

## Your Rights

### Using Infrastructure
When bike infrastructure exists, you generally must use it—but exceptions apply:
- Preparing to turn
- Avoiding hazards
- Lane too narrow
- Infrastructure blocked

### When No Infrastructure
You have full right to use the roadway.

## Infrastructure and Liability

If you're injured due to defective infrastructure:
- City may be liable for design defects
- Government immunity may apply
- Notice requirements often strict
- Act quickly to preserve claims`

## Accident & Liability Questions

**Q: What should I do right after a bicycle accident?**
A: Call 911, document the scene, get witness info, seek medical attention, and don't admit fault.

**Q: Can I sue if I wasn't wearing a helmet?**
A: Yes. Helmet use affects injury severity arguments but doesn't determine fault.

**Q: What if the driver says I ran a stop sign?**
A: Disputed liability requires investigation. Witnesses, cameras, and physical evidence help determine truth.

**Q: How long do I have to file a lawsuit?**
A: Varies by state—typically 2-4 years. But start immediately to preserve evidence.

## Insurance Questions

**Q: Do I need a lawyer for an insurance claim?**
A: For serious injuries, yes. Studies show represented victims recover 3-4x more.

**Q: What if the driver doesn't have insurance?**
A: Your UM/UIM coverage may apply. Hit and run victims often use this coverage.

**Q: Will my health insurance be reimbursed from my settlement?**
A: Often yes, through subrogation. Liens can be negotiated.

## Damages Questions

**Q: How much is my case worth?**
A: Depends on injury severity, medical bills, lost wages, and fault allocation.

**Q: What damages can I recover?**
A: Medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, property damage, and sometimes punitive damages.

**Q: How long until I get paid?**
A: Simple cases: 3-6 months. Complex cases: 1-3 years or more.`
