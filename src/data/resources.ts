    content: `Being in a bicycle accident is traumatic. Knowing what to do helps protect your health and legal rights.

## At the Scene

### 1. Assess Your Injuries
Don't move if you suspect a spinal injury. Check yourself for injuries, but remember adrenaline can mask pain.

### 2. Call 911
Always call police, even for minor accidents. A police report documents the incident officially.

### 3. Move to Safety
If you can move safely, get out of traffic. Don't leave the scene entirely.

### 4. Document Everything
- Take photos of vehicles, damage, and the scene
- Photograph your injuries
- Note weather and road conditions
- Get witness names and contact info

### 5. Exchange Information
Get the driver's:
- Name and contact info
- Driver's license number
- Insurance information
- Vehicle registration

### 6. Don't Admit Fault
Even saying "I'm sorry" can be used against you. Stick to facts.

## After the Scene

### 7. Seek Medical Attention
Go to the ER or urgent care, even if injuries seem minor. Internal injuries aren't always obvious.

### 8. Preserve Evidence
- Don't repair or clean your bike
- Keep damaged clothing and helmet
- Save all receipts and documents

### 9. Don't Give Recorded Statements
Insurance companies will call quickly. Politely decline until you speak with an attorney.

### 10. Contact an Attorney
Most offer free consultations. The sooner an attorney is involved, the better evidence can be preserved.`

    description: "Comprehensive guide to helmet requirements across all 50 states and how they affect your accident claim.",
    icon: "🪖",
    content: `Helmet laws vary significantly by state. Understanding these laws helps you stay legal and know how helmet use affects accident claims.

## No Statewide Helmet Requirement
These states have no statewide bicycle helmet law:
- Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada
- Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Wisconsin
- Michigan, Indiana, Arkansas, Mississippi
- Vermont, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Kentucky

**Note:** Local ordinances may still require helmets.

## Youth Helmet Laws

### Under 18
Alabama, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, West Virginia

### Under 16
California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee

### Under 14
Louisiana

### Under 12
Some local ordinances

## All-Ages Helmet Laws
No state requires helmets for all cyclists, though some cities do (e.g., some areas of California for certain activities).

## How Helmet Use Affects Your Case

### In States Without Requirements
Generally, helmet use cannot be used to reduce your damages. The driver's negligence caused your accident.

### In States With Requirements
If you violated the helmet law, insurance companies may argue contributory negligence.

### Practical Reality
Even in no-requirement states, insurance companies often try to blame unhelmeted cyclists. An experienced attorney can counter these arguments.

## Our Recommendation
Wear a helmet regardless of legal requirements. It protects your brain and strengthens your legal position.`

    icon: "🛤️",
    content: `Bike lanes provide dedicated space for cyclists, but knowing your rights is essential when conflicts arise.

## Types of Bike Lanes

### Class I: Bike Path
Completely separate from vehicle traffic. Highest protection.

### Class II: Bike Lane
Painted lane on roadway, often with buffer zone.

### Class III: Bike Route
Shared lane with sharrows or signs. Vehicles and bikes share space.

### Protected Bike Lane
Physical barrier (posts, planters, curb) separates bikes from traffic.

## Your Rights

### Using Bike Lanes
Most states require cyclists to use bike lanes when provided, BUT exceptions exist:

- Preparing to turn left
- Passing another cyclist or pedestrian
- Avoiding hazards (debris, parked cars, potholes)
- The lane is too narrow for safe passage
- Approaching an intersection

### Leaving the Bike Lane
You can legally leave a bike lane for safety reasons. Document the hazard that forced you out.

## Driver Obligations

Drivers must:
- Not park in bike lanes (unless loading/unloading where permitted)
- Yield when crossing bike lanes
- Check for cyclists before opening doors
- Not drive in bike lanes

## Bike Lane Violations as Evidence

When a driver violates bike lane rules and injures you:
- Traffic violation supports negligence claim
- May be negligence per se
- Shows disregard for cyclist safety
- Supports higher damages`

    icon: "🛡️",
    content: `Vulnerable Road User (VRU) laws create special protections for cyclists, pedestrians, and others who face greater injury risk from vehicle collisions.

## Who Are Vulnerable Road Users?

Typically includes:
- Cyclists
- Pedestrians
- Motorcyclists
- Scooter and skateboard riders
- People in wheelchairs
- Road workers
- Horse riders

## What VRU Laws Do

### Enhanced Penalties
Drivers who carelessly injure VRUs face:
- Higher fines ($1,000+)
- Mandatory community service
- Driver education requirements
- License suspension
- Potentially criminal charges

### Civil Impact
VRU violations support:
- Negligence per se arguments
- Higher damage awards
- Punitive damages in egregious cases

## States with VRU Laws

Over 30 states have some form of VRU protection:
- Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut
- Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana
- Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota
- Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina
- Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont
- Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and others

Laws vary significantly—check your state's specific provisions.

## Limitations

VRU laws don't:
- Prevent all accidents
- Guarantee prosecution
- Create automatic civil liability

They're deterrents and support for civil claims, not complete protection.`

    icon: "📏",
    content: `Safe passing laws require vehicles to maintain minimum distance when overtaking cyclists. These laws protect cyclists and establish liability when violated.

## The Standard: 3 Feet

The majority of states require at least 3 feet of passing distance:
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and DC.

## States with Greater Requirements

### 4 Feet
- New Jersey
- Pennsylvania
- North Carolina

### 5 Feet (at higher speeds)
- New Mexico (when passing at 35+ mph)

### Variable Requirements
- Some states increase distance based on speed
- Some require "safe distance" without specifying feet

## How Safe Passing Laws Help Your Case

### Proving Violation
If a driver passes too closely and causes an accident:
- Traffic code violation establishes negligence
- May be negligence per se
- Physical evidence (mirror strikes, sideswipes) proves close pass

### Evidence That Helps
- Witness testimony
- Camera footage
- Vehicle damage patterns
- Expert accident reconstruction

## Enforcement Challenges

Despite these laws:
- Rarely enforced
- Difficult to prove exact distance
- Many drivers unaware of requirements
- Police often don't witness violations`

## Important Exceptions

### Discovery Rule
Some states start the clock when you discover (or should have discovered) your injury, not the accident date.

### Minors
Typically, the statute is "tolled" (paused) until the minor turns 18.

### Government Claims
Claims against government entities often have much shorter deadlines—30 to 180 days for notice requirements.

### Defendant Absent
If the at-fault party leaves the state, the clock may pause.

## Don't Wait

Even with years to file, acting quickly:
- Preserves evidence
- Locates witnesses while memories are fresh
- Demonstrates seriousness
- Gives your attorney time to build your case`

    description: "How shared fault affects your bicycle accident claim, from pure comparative to contributory negligence states.",
    icon: "⚖️",
    content: `Your state's negligence system dramatically impacts your recovery if you share any fault for the accident.

## Contributory Negligence States

**Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington D.C.**

### The Harsh Rule
If you're found even 1% at fault, you recover NOTHING.

### Why It's Devastating
Insurance companies aggressively argue any fault to avoid paying. Even minor violations (not wearing a helmet, slight speeding) can bar recovery.

## Pure Comparative Negligence States

**California, New York, Florida, and about 10 others**

### The Fair Rule
Your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault, but you can always recover something.

### Example
$100,000 damages at 30% fault = $70,000 recovery

## Modified Comparative Negligence States

**Most states follow this system**

### 50% Bar Rule
Recover if less than 50% at fault.

### 51% Bar Rule
Recover if 50% or less at fault.

### Example
At 49% fault with $100,000 damages = $51,000 recovery
At 51% fault under 51% bar rule = $0 recovery

## How Fault Is Determined

Insurance companies and juries consider:
- Traffic law violations by either party
- Visibility (lights, clothing)
- Road position
- Speed
- Weather conditions
- Reaction time and awareness

## Protecting Yourself

- Follow all traffic laws
- Use lights and visible clothing
- Don't admit fault at the scene
- Get witness contact information
- Document everything`

    icon: "📄",
    content: `Multiple insurance policies may cover your bicycle accident injuries. Understanding your options maximizes recovery.

## Driver's Auto Insurance

### Bodily Injury Liability
Covers injuries you cause to others. This is where most bicycle accident claims are filed.

### Minimum Limits Vary by State
- Low: $15,000 per person (some states)
- Medium: $30,000-50,000 per person
- High: $100,000+ per person

### Problem
Minimums are often inadequate for serious injuries.

## Your Auto Insurance

### Uninsured Motorist (UM)
Covers you when hit by an uninsured driver—often applies even when you're on a bicycle.

### Underinsured Motorist (UIM)
Covers the gap when driver's insurance isn't enough.

### Medical Payments (MedPay)
Covers your medical bills regardless of fault.

### Check Your Policy
Not all policies cover you while cycling. Review yours now.

## Health Insurance

Your health insurance covers accident injuries like any illness. However:
- Deductibles and copays apply
- Subrogation may require repayment from settlement
- Doesn't cover pain and suffering

## Homeowner's/Renter's Insurance

May provide liability coverage if you cause an accident injuring someone else.

## Maximizing Coverage

1. Know all available policies
2. Stack coverage when allowed
3. Understand exclusions
4. File claims strategically
5. Work with an experienced attorney`

- Spinal cord damage
- Severe TBI
- Permanent disability

### Wrongful Death ($500,000 - $10,000,000+)
- Depends on age, earnings, dependents

## Factors Affecting Value

### Liability Clarity
Clear fault = higher settlement. Disputed = lower.

### Injury Severity
More severe = higher compensation.

### Medical Documentation
Well-documented treatment supports your claim.

### Insurance Limits
Can't get more than available coverage.

### Your Credibility
Juries and adjusters assess believability.

### Jurisdiction
Some areas have higher verdict averages.

### Attorney Quality
Experienced attorneys achieve better results.

## The Settlement Process

1. Complete medical treatment
2. Gather all documentation
3. Calculate full damages
4. Send demand to insurance
5. Negotiate
6. Accept settlement or file lawsuit

## When to Settle vs. Litigate

Settlement offers certainty and speed. Litigation offers potentially higher recovery but takes longer and has risks.`
