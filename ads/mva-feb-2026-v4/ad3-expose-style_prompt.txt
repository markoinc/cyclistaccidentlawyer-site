Original: Bold B2B advertising graphic on dark charcoal (#1A1A1A) background. Red alert icon at top with bold white text 'YOUR VENDOR IS PLAYING YOU'. Center shows flow diagram: 'Aggregator $50' arrow to 'Vendor $300' which splits to multiple icons representing law firms. Large red 'X4 MARKUP' stamp overlay. Below in blue (#3399FF) box: 'OUR MODEL: One campaign = One firm = Your cases'. Bottom: 'Stop being the product.' Industrial tech aesthetic, sharp corners, square format.

Revised: Design a bold business-to-business (B2B) advertising graphic on a dark charcoal (#1A1A1A) background. The graphic should feature an urgent red alert icon at the top with bold white text displaying 'YOUR VENDOR IS PLAYING YOU'. The center of the design requires a flow diagram showing 'Aggregator $50' arrowing to 'Vendor $300', which then splits to multiple icons symbolizing law firms. Emphasize the representation of the inflated cost with a large red 'X4 MARKUP' stamp overlay. Further below, envelop the text 'OUR MODEL: One campaign = One firm = Your cases' in a blue (#3399FF) rectangular section. Finish the graphic with the statement 'Stop being the product.' at the bottom. Craft the overall graphic with an industrial tech aesthetic, sharp corners, and square format.
