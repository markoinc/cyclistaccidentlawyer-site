Original: Professional B2B cost comparison infographic on dark charcoal (#1A1A1A) background. Header 'THE REAL MATH' in bold white. Two columns side by side: LEFT column labeled 'DIY LEADS' shows calculator with red-amber numbers ($20,000 spend, struck-through '$1,333', 'REAL COST: $2,000+'). RIGHT column labeled 'WE DELIVER' shows clean '$3,000/case' in bright blue (#3399FF) with glow, checkmarks for 'We fund ads', 'We qualify', 'We sign'. Bottom: 'For $1k more, never touch intake again.' Sharp data visualization aesthetic, square format.

Revised: Generate a professional B2B cost comparison infographic with a dark charcoal (#1A1A1A) background. The header should read 'THE REAL MATH' in bold, white letters. There should be two columns side by side. The left column, labeled 'DIY LEADS', should display a calculator with red-amber numbers. The numbers should read '$20,000 spend' and then have a line through '$1,333' with text underneath that says 'REAL COST: $2,000+'. The right column, labeled 'WE DELIVER', should be clean with '$3,000/case' written in a bright blue color (#3399FF) with a glow effect. It should contain checkmarks alongside the phrases 'We fund ads', 'We qualify', 'We sign'. At the bottom, add a line that says 'For $1k more, never touch intake again.' The graphic should reflect a sharp data visualization aesthetic and be square in format.
