# Dashboard Mission

**Saved:** 2026-01-31 08:33 UTC
**From Marko:**

> How about this. you make yourself a nice plan first for exploring every single file, integration, resource you have locally and through integrations or apis, and try genuinely to get a really good understanding of what exactly im trying to do and my overall goal and build the dashboard in service of that, keeping in mind that over time I plan on building the dashboard into a full tool that runs my entire business. remember, client acquisition is first.

## Core Directives

1. **Explore EVERYTHING** - files, integrations, APIs, resources
2. **Understand deeply** - what Marko is trying to do, overall goal
3. **Build in service of the goal** - dashboard serves the mission
4. **Think long-term** - this becomes a full business operations tool
5. **Client acquisition FIRST** - priority #1

## The Goal (UPDATED 2026-01-31)

### 🎯 Ultimate Goal
**$9.6M business sale** — fully automated, high margin

### 📞 Short-Term Goal  
**2-3 client acquisition sales calls/day** at lowest cost per call possible

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Calls/day** - Target: 2-3 (currently ~1/day based on 5-7/week)
2. **Cost per call** - Currently $180-300, goal: minimize
3. **Pipeline value** - Track toward $9.6M valuation
4. **Automation %** - What's automated vs manual
5. **Margins** - Revenue minus costs

### What This Means for the Dashboard
- Every feature should drive toward MORE CALLS at LOWER COST
- Show daily call tracking prominently
- Surface cost metrics clearly
- Highlight automation opportunities
- Track revenue/margin in real-time

## What "Running the Entire Business" Means

The dashboard should eventually:
- Track all prospects and pipeline stages
- Monitor lead generation metrics
- Show revenue/costs in real-time
- Manage campaigns and ad spend
- Track client relationships
- Automate follow-ups and reminders
- Surface actionable insights
- Control all integrations from one place
- Spawn tasks and agents as needed
