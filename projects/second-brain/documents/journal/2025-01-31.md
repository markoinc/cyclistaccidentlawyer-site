# Friday, January 31st

## Morning
Started the day with setting up the Second Brain system. This is exactly what we need - a place to capture every idea, insight, and important discussion.

## Key Discussions Today
- Talked about the importance of never losing ideas
- Discussed auto-tagging system for revenue ideas, client work, automation, and content
- Explored the Obsidian meets Linear aesthetic for the UI

## Action Items
- [ ] Set up daily journaling habit
- [ ] Create concept documents for important topics
- [ ] Configure auto-tagging for new entries

## Reflections
The Second Brain concept from Alex Finn is brilliant. The idea of having Clawdbot automatically capture and organize our discussions into a searchable knowledge base will be incredibly valuable for the $9.6M exit journey.

> "Never lose an idea again" - this should be our mantra.

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Begin documenting key business concepts
- Set up integrations with other tools
- Review and tag existing notes
