# $9.6M Exit Strategy

## The Goal
Build a business worth $9.6M with only 2-3 sales calls per day.

## Key Principles

### 1. Leverage Over Labor
Every hour of work should create systems that continue generating value without ongoing effort.

### 2. Automation First
Before hiring, ask: "Can Clawdbot do this?"
- Lead research ✅
- Email monitoring ✅
- Content ideas ✅
- Meeting prep ✅
- Market research ✅

### 3. High-Value Calls Only
The 2-3 calls per day should be:
- Pre-qualified leads
- High ticket opportunities
- Strategic partnerships
- Not discovery calls that go nowhere
