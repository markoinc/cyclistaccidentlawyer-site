**Working Backwards:**
- Calls needed: 50/month
- Qualified leads needed: 50 ÷ 50% = **100 qualified leads/month**
- Total leads needed: 100 ÷ 40% = **250 leads/month**
- Traffic needed: 250 ÷ 3% = **8,333 visitors/month**

### Conservative Estimate (2% conversion):
- Traffic needed: 250 ÷ 2% = **12,500 visitors/month**
