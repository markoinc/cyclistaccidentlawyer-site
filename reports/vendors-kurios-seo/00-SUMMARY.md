## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Market Opportunity
- **No authoritative vendor comparison site exists** for MVA/PI lead generation
- Competitors (Clio, CasePeer) are generic, not MVA-specific
- Vendor landing pages dominate SERPs, not informational content
- Huge opportunity for "Wirecutter of Legal Lead Gen"

### 2. Buyer Insights
- **4 distinct personas** with different needs:
  1. Fast Scalers (35%) - want proven systems
  2. Burned Veterans (30%) - need guarantees
  3. Solo Transitioners (25%) - cautious, budget-conscious
  4. Sophisticated Buyers (10%) - comparison shopping
- **Major pain point:** Distrust from past vendor failures (Quintessa, Walker)
- **Key objection:** Media buy vs pay-per-lead preference

### 3. SEO Insights
- **Primary keywords:**
  - "personal injury lead generation" (210/mo, LOW comp)
  - "motor vehicle accident leads" (210/mo, MEDIUM comp)
  - "MVA leads for attorneys" (30/mo, HIGH intent)
- **Content gap:** No comprehensive vendor reviews exist
- **Quick wins:** Vendor review pages (Quintessa, Walker, etc.)

### 4. Vendor Landscape
- **Quality benchmarks:** Cases On Demand, Inquire2Esquire
- **Red flag vendors:** Quintessa (consistent complaints)
- **Established players:** Walker, 4LegalLeads, Martindale-Nolo
- **55+ vendors catalogued** with ratings and services
