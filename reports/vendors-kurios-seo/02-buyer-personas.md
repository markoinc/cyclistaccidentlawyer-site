### Desired Outcomes

## PERSONA 2: THE BURNED VETERAN 🔥

- **Location:** Competitive markets (TX primarily)
- **Revenue:** $500K-$5M
- **Current Caseload:** 30-75 cases

### Psychographics
- **Risk Tolerance:** LOW - deeply burned by past vendors
- **Decision Style:** Analytical, skeptical, contractually focused
- **Growth Stage:** Stabilization or cautious growth
- **Values:** Transparency, accountability, guarantees

### Pain Points (Critical)
1. **Deep distrust of marketing agencies** - burned by Quintessa, Walker, etc.
2. **Wasted $100K-$250K+ on failed marketing**
3. **Need contractual protections and guarantees**
4. **High attrition rates from poor quality vendors**
5. **Lack of transparency from past vendors**

### Transcript Evidence
> "I have probably spent quarter million dollars on wasted marketing... The sales pitch is always so rosy, and then you sign on the dotted line and then it just doesn't pan out." - Scott Barney

> "I won't even mess with Quintessa. The attrition rate is even worse... they sent me leads that said they had never signed any sort of click form. They weren't involved in a wreck." - Rich Hyde

> "I've been burned on ad management a million times... every guy I've worked with gave me the same pitch you did." - Rich Hyde

### Desired Outcomes
- **Primary:** Consistent, qualified case flow with contractual protections
- **Secondary:** Guaranteed minimum cases per campaign
- **Success Metric:** Pay-per-qualified-lead or pay-per-case with credit system

### Objection Patterns
- "I've heard this pitch before"
- "Why should I trust you?"
- "What happens if leads don't convert?"
- "I want it in writing"
- "I like pay-per-lead because I can pinpoint the contract violations"

### Ideal Offer
- **Guaranteed minimums in contract**
- Credit system for bad leads
- Transparent pricing (not opaque)
- Trial period with refund option
- Long-term partnership once trust earned

### Messaging Angle
**"Burned by vendors before? We get it. Transparent pricing, contractual guarantees, and credits for leads that don't qualify."**

### Special Handling Notes
- They WILL push back on media buy model
- Consider offering pay-per-lead at premium (3.50 vs 2.50) for first batch
- Must address their specific past vendor failures directly
- References to specific competitors (Quintessa issues) build credibility

### Desired Outcomes
- **Primary:** 5-10 consistent signups/month to sustain practice

## COMMON OBJECTIONS ACROSS ALL PERSONAS

### Pricing Transparency
> "What's your pricing model exactly?" / "Why don't you disclose your fee?"

**Response:** "We bake our fee into the budget so you get true raw cost of the lead. Your leads will be $250-350 in California, about $200-250 in other states. The case cost is what matters - and that's consistently $1,700-3,500 depending on state and criteria."

### Media Buy vs Pay-Per-Lead
> "I prefer pay per lead because I can pinpoint issues"

**Response:** "I understand. We used to offer pay-per-lead and still do for some clients at $350/lead. The tradeoff is you'll pay about 30% more per case. Most clients prefer our campaign model once they see the first batch results. Happy to start with PPL if that builds trust."

### Past Vendor Failures
> "I've heard this pitch before and been burned"

**Response:** "I hear that a lot. Can I ask who burned you? [Listen]. Yeah, [Quintessa/Walker/whoever] has that reputation. Here's what's different - we don't do calculators, fake testimonials, or round-robin leads. Everything is exclusive, and our intake partner Patrick is a former director of intake - he knows what a real case looks like."

### Why Should I Trust You?
> "Why should I trust you over anyone else?"

**Response:** "Fair question. We've worked with Angel Reyes for 3-4 years, Jacobi, Wilshire... I can connect you with Patrick at Inquire to Esquire who you can talk criteria with. But honestly, the proof is in the first batch. We don't do long-term contracts - if it doesn't work, you don't continue."
