## 🔥 STRATEGY #1: LLM Listicle Play (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### Why This Matters for MVA
ChatGPT and Perplexity are now major discovery channels. When someone asks "who's the best car accident lawyer in [city]", AI pulls from listicles.

### Jacky's Key Findings (Dec 4 - Ahrefs 26,000 URL Study):
- **43.8% of ChatGPT citations come from listicles**
- DR doesn't matter as much for ChatGPT - they cite plenty of DR0 sites
- **Topical authority is back** - niche sites get cited more
- Freshness matters - recent content gets priority
- **Self-promotional lists work** - over 1/3 of software responses cited company's own "best X" list

### Action Plan for MVA:
1. **Create "Best Car Accident Lawyer [City]" pages** on your sites
   - Include 5-10 lawyers/firms (including your partners' clients)
   - Add real info: case results, reviews, specialties
   - Make it actually useful, not just ego pieces

2. **Listicle Everything You Control:**
   - MVA Engine site
   - Any client sites
   - Partner sites (Cases on Demand, Inquired Esquire networks)
   - Create new niche sites specifically for listicles

3. **Target These Queries:**
   - "best car accident lawyer [city]"
   - "best personal injury attorney near me"
   - "top MVA lawyers [state]"
   - "[lawyer name] vs [lawyer name]"

### Quick Win SOP:
```
1. Pick top 10 target cities
2. Create "Best Car Accident Lawyer in [City] 2026" page for each
3. Include 7-10 firms with:
   - Case results if available
   - Google review snippets
   - Specialties (MVA, truck accidents, etc.)
   - Honest pros/cons
4. Update monthly to maintain freshness
```

## 🔥 STRATEGY #2: Reddit Domination (10-Minute SOP)

### Jacky's Reddit Comment Strategy (Jan 19 - 10k+ Comments Tested)

This is **gold for MVA leads** because:
- People post about accidents constantly on Reddit
- These threads rank on Google
- Comments in ranking threads = free traffic forever

### Target Subreddits:
- r/legaladvice
- r/Insurance  
- r/PersonalFinance
- r/[City] subreddits
- r/CarAccidents
- r/WhatsWrongWithYourCar (for accident posts)

### The "Human Stack" Comment Template:
```
Line 1 - Empathy:
"I went through something similar last year..."

Line 2 - Mini story:
"Was rear-ended at a red light, insurance tried to lowball me..."

Line 3 - Soft recommendation:
"Ended up getting a free consultation with [firm] and they got me 3x what insurance offered..."

Line 4 - Balanced comparison:
"If it's a minor fender bender, you might be fine handling it yourself. But if there's any injury, definitely talk to someone..."

Line 5 - Anti-shill exit:
"not a lawyer, just my experience"
```

### Placement Strategy:
- **5 "money keywords"** to target:
  - "car accident what do i do"
  - "insurance lowball offer"
  - "do i need a lawyer after accident"
  - "best personal injury lawyer [city]"
  - "settlement offer reddit"

- **New threads**: Be one of first 5 comments (most visibility)
- **Old ranking threads**: Add genuine value, specific details

### Survival Tips:
- Lowercase is fine
- Small typos = more human
- Never say "game changer" or "revolutionary"
- Don't link directly in first comment - follow up later

### Boost Pattern:
- Zero votes first 2 weeks
- Drip upvotes over 2 days
- Stop at 5-10 upvotes
- Never nuke with instant votes

## 🔥 STRATEGY #3: Parasite SEO (Quick Wins)

### Jacky's Parasite SOP (Jan 16):
```
1. Find subreddit in niche (r/legaladvice, r/insurance)
2. Export all keywords from Ahrefs
3. Recreate content targeting each keyword
4. Submit to Indexchex for faster indexing
```

### For MVA:
- Create Medium articles: "I Got Rear-Ended in [City] - Here's What I Did"
- LinkedIn articles targeting professional searches
- Quora answers for accident-related questions
- YouTube videos (even simple slideshow style)

---

## 🔥 STRATEGY #4: AI Mode Local SEO (GBP Optimization)

### Jacky's Dec 9 Recommendations:
For Google AI Overviews pulling local results:

1. **Write actual service descriptions on GBP**
   - Not just "Personal Injury Lawyer"
   - "Car Accident Attorney - Free Consultation - No Fee Unless We Win"

2. **Add starting prices/ranges**
   - "Contingency Fee: 33% of Settlement"
   - "Free Case Evaluation"

3. **Stack cost FAQs in GBP Q&A and on site**
   - "How much does a car accident lawyer cost?"
   - "Do I pay upfront for a personal injury case?"

4. **Keep profile active weekly**
   - Regular posts
   - Respond to reviews
   - Update photos

## 🔥 STRATEGY #5: GEO Agency Playbook

### How to Get Clients (Jacky's Dec 6 SOP):
- Cold email
- Short form video covering GEO/AI SEO EVERYDAY
- LinkedIn outreach
- Posting on X (once a day + being a reply guy)
- Long form YouTube

### How to Rank Clients:
- Write comparison + best xyz blog posts
- Get "LLM Boosters" like PBN + LLM Guest Posts
- Get press releases that accept "best xyz" keywords

## 💡 BIG PICTURE INSIGHT

Jacky's thesis: **2026 is the year of the LLM Listicle**

The game is shifting from "rank on Google" to "get cited by AI". For MVA:
- People will increasingly ask ChatGPT/Perplexity for lawyer recommendations
- Being in listicles = being recommended by AI
- Reddit comments that rank = getting surfaced in AI answers
- This is a **first-mover advantage** window - most lawyers aren't doing this yet
