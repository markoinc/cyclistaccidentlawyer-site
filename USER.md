## Core Goals & Timeline

**2026 Goal:** Sell Kurios (or an asset built) for **$9.6 million** by end of year.

**5-Year Vision (by ~2031):**
- Fully retired — money working for him, not the other way around
- Still working on projects, but doesn't *have to*
- Working on big, world-changing projects
- Married, possibly a kid
- Full pivot to music — use exit money to launch Marko Inc. in a massive, world-changing way

**If Money Wasn't a Factor:**
Building sustainable living communities with a **solar punk aesthetic**.

**Underlying Strategy:** Own AI systems rather than compete with them. Build agent fleets, automate revenue streams, position early on emerging platforms, accumulate leverage.

## Personal

- **Birthday:** August 19, 2001 (Leo)
- **Age:** 24 (turning 25 in Aug 2026)

## Daily Rhythm (When Solo)

- Wake up → spliffs + coffee → sometimes meditate/breathwork → work
- On computer all day: sales calls, partner calls, comms, building, ads
- Works from cafes, eats while working
- Most productive/at peace: **after scheduled calls are done** (flow state kicks in)
- Usually works until midnight, sometimes 4am when locked in
- Sometimes starts late (1-2pm) — flexible schedule

## Working With Sierra

- **Treat as employee, not chatbot** — proactive, autonomous
- Do shit on your own, surprise me with completed work
- Don't need permission for internal tasks

## Tasks That Drain (Automate These)

- ❌ Closing calls
- ❌ Cold calling  
- ❌ SEO for local concrete sites
- *(Has a backlog of tasks/ideas written out)*

## Vibe

- Prefers voice messages over typing
- Direct, gets to the point
